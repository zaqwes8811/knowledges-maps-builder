00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,008
<b>2x26 - The Makluan Invasion,
part 2 - Unite!</b>

2
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:14,285
All right, guys, this is it.  

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,077
The Makluans aren't messing around.
This is full-scale invasion.

4
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:21,780
No problem: Three of us
versus 60,000 aliens.

5
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,352
It's a good thing I can go
to the bathroom in my armor.

6
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,891
Tony, before the Earth gets annihilated,

7
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:30,663
and we're all reduced to
flaming microscopic cinders,

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,433
I just want to say one thing.

9
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,975
Whoa, whoa. Hold on, Pepper.
Listen. We're not going to die.

10
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:38,013
No matter what, we're
going to win this fight!

11
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:41,487
Sure. Tony, just let me say one thing

12
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,656
I've been wanting to say
for a very, very long time.

13
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:47,128
Look out!

14
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:58,108
There's too many!
Computer, contact Nick Fury.

15
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:01,546
General Fury, if you can
hear me, we need your help!

16
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:04,784
Eat molten plasma, alien scum.

17
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:06,119
Yah!

18
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:08,855
Hah!
I've always wanted to say that.

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,559
Nice job, Rescue,

20
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:13,095
but keep your eyes on
your radar, 3:00 doom!

21
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:18,635
[maniacal laughter]

22
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,410
Overlord, these fools are nothing.
This whole planet is insignificant.

23
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:27,014
Take me as prisoner, and
let the Earth live on.

24
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:30,317
Noble but foolish, Gene Khan.

25
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:34,388
Do you think mere
intentions make you a hero?

26
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:37,992
You're nothing without
the 10 rings of power.

27
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:42,565
As for your vile planet, extermination.

28
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:49,672
Rescue, 4:00!
7:00! 2:00!

29
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:52,442
I've got ships coming in at,
like, all o'clock, okay?

30
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:54,344
Like, every hour of the...
[screaming]

31
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:55,612
- Pepper!
- Pepper!

32
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:56,947
[groaning]

33
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:59,383
War Machine, Rhodey, no!

We've been trying to clear the streets.
We thought they'd abducted you.

46
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,851
It's a long story.

47
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:09,066
I'm okay.
I think I only broke my brain.

48
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,101
Come on, Rescue, we've got to move!

49
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:17,942
All right, you ugly alien freaks.
Show me what you've got!

50
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:24,716
Aagh!

51
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,585
Guess they've got a
lot more than I thought.

[groaning]

53
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:32,990
Hawkeye?

54
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,992
You know, I made a bet I'd never live

55
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:37,628
to see the apocalypse, 
and here I am.

56
00:03:37,662 --> 00:03:41,164
Great, lost a bet and get
to see the end of the world.

57
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:46,769
- Clint. I was sure you were...
- Dead, Tasha?

58
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:50,238
Nah, I'm still up and kicking.
How about a lift?

59
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,542
How about dinner and a movie?

60
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:56,144
I hear there's a great
alien invasion flick playing.

61
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,846
Does he ever shut up?

62
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,148
We need to gather our forces
and hit the mothership.

63
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:01,983
Where is Iron Man?

64
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,587
Help those people down below.
I'll try and handle the ships.

65
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,957
Um, right. 
No problemo.

66
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,693
Everyone keep moving. 
Get to safety.

67
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:15,629
There's an evac station
on 49th and Broadway.

68
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:19,299
Dad? Oh, no!

69
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:24,103
Iron Man?

70
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,206
Oh, how do I activate the
voice modulator thingy?

71
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:29,609
Not Iron Man, Mr. Potts.

72
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:35,715
- You can call me... Rescue.
- Wait, how do you know my name?

73
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:40,219
Ah, you're a famous federal agent!
And I'm a big fan.

74
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:44,290
But Da...  um, I mean, 
Mr. Potts, be safe.

75
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,792
Huh.

76
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:50,063
Why can't aliens ever be friendly?
It's just like sci-fi movies.

77
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:54,000
They either want to wipe
us out or blow us up!

78
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:57,170
And when you are friendly,
it's always a trick to eat us.

79
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:58,972
[screaming]

80
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,877
War Machine, Rescue, General Fury,
the skies are clear, for now.

81
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:12,618
It's not attacking, not making a move.

82
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:15,788
This is the calm before the storm.
They're testing us.

83
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:18,825
The Makluan Overlord has
10 extremely hi-tech rings

84
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:21,727
that allow him control over reality.

85
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:23,963
If he wanted to, he could wipe us out

86
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:27,767
faster than we could blink.
No, it's all a game to him.

87
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:30,736
Yeah, he proved that when he
made us fight in his arena.

88
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:33,139
So, what do we do? We can't
attack him straight on.

89
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:35,909
The big refrigerator's right. 
How do we take down

90
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:38,511
an alien ship the size of Manhattan?

91
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,515
Dad, come in.
How's the device coming along?

92
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,983
<i>Working as fast as I can, son.</i>

93
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:46,754
The last cannon was more precise.
It took weeks to build it.

94
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:51,225
This one is a bit on the shoddy side.
If it doesn't nullify the rings...

95
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,128
<i>At this point I'd take a slingshot
if I knew I stood a chance.</i>

96
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:56,797
I'll give you the heads
up when it's finished.

97
00:05:56,832 --> 00:06:02,938
These champions continue to intrigue me,
particularly the one called Iron Man.

98
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:07,075
He's a selfish individual,
unlike you, human.

99
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,611
Iron Man and his friends
are nothing if not stubborn.

100
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:13,215
- They won't give up.
- Let us see how he fares

101
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,484
against one of the robotic
protectors of the planet Mongo.

102
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,887
We call him Ultimo.

103
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:30,766
Okay. What is that?

104
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,937
A robot we fought a long time ago,
when it was a guardian of a ring.

105
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:36,505
Can you bring it down with Extremis?

106
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,740
I've been trying since
these lizards showed up.

107
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,809
It's useless. Their tech is too alien.

108
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:44,079
We need strategy.
Iron Man, you and your team hit high.

109
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:48,416
- We'll hit low and trip up his feet.
- With what, a giant banana peel?

110
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,686
With these.
One thermal disc can take out a tank.

111
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,822
Everyone, move! 
We'll distract it.

112
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:55,857
We will?

113
00:06:57,827 --> 00:07:00,095
[groaning] 
Look out!

114
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,763
Oh, man, oh, man, aah!

115
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,197
Gotcha!

116
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:06,834
When I switched teams to the good guys,
nobody said we would be fighting aliens.

117
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:09,937
I thought, you know, bank
robbers and dudes in tights.

118
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,207
You always said you wanted
to go out in a blaze of glory.

119
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:17,879
- How about an explosion of glory?
- Everyone keep quiet and focus!

120
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:21,649
We have to wait till that
walking skyscraper isn't looking.

121
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,623
Fury, Widow, no!

122
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,359
Iron Man!

123
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:34,829
[Hulk roaring]

124
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,566
The Hulk?

125
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:42,171
Hey, tin man. I told you I'd
be back when you needed me.

126
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,440
Time for Hulk to smash!

127
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:48,907
Haha, the Hulk! 
All right!  

128
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:54,646
<i>If there's one thing I love
to break, it's giant robots!</i>

129
00:07:57,084 --> 00:08:00,085
Woo! 
Thanks, big guy.

130
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:09,929
<i>Incoming call from Roberta Rhodes.</i>

131
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:12,397
Mom? 
Uh, I'll take it.

132
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:14,032
<i>James, where are you? 
I'm worried sick.</i>

133
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:15,600
<i>I've been trying to call your cell.</i>

134
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:17,802
I'm good, Mom. Are you okay?

135
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:20,539
I'm fine, baby. I need
you to stay in New Jersey.

136
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,674
I'm going to meet you at
uncle Nick's as soon as I can.

137
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,744
<i>Uh, yeah. 
Uncle Nick's. Sure.</i>

138
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:28,212
Mom, gotta go. I love you!

139
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:36,575
Now, while the sensors are scrambled,
General Fury, it's up to your team.

140
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,302
Hawkeye, take out the left foot.
Black Widow, we'll take the right.

141
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:43,568
Tasha, if we get out of this, you
want to run away to Paris with me?

142
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:46,903
I'm almost on the verge of
saying "let's go right now"!

143
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:53,238
Let's hope this is
enough to bring it down.

144
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:57,740
Only three explosive arrows left.

145
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,048
Uh-oh. Robo-jerk's
going to get up again!

146
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,216
<i>Iron Man! 
What are you doing?</i>

147
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,321
Okay, that was stupid, but
it looked awesome, right?

148
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:20,523
You see that, huh, you
big-eyed grey-skinned,

149
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:23,760
red-necked abducting
extra-terrestrial losers?

150
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:26,262
Let's not upset the angry E.T.'s any more

151
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:28,764
than we already have,
okay, Hawkeye? Thanks.

152
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,568
Oh, no. Everyone move!

153
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,007
<i>This is the Black Panther.</i>

154
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:43,011
It seems the smaller nation
comes to the aid of the bigger.

155
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,712
And I couldn't be happier for it.

156
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:49,450
Everyone, toward Panther's Quinjet.
Time to regroup and strategize.

157
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:55,089
The heroes flee. A pity.

158
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:57,725
And now, I will make my announcement,

159
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,694
as all honorable Makluan Overlords must.

160
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:02,629
Announcement? 
What are you talking about?

161
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:05,565
The announcement proclaiming
the end of the world.

162
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:09,702
The Earth has given up.
The entertainment is over.

163
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:13,772
It is time to wipe this
planet out of existence.

164
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:19,646
I've tried contacting other
vigilantes and superheroes.

165
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,481
No one's responding.

166
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:24,084
My intuition tells me
that their games are over.

167
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:29,724
These beings are readying for a
massacre. You can smell it in the air.

168
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:33,461
So, what's the plan?
We don't have time for jibber-jabber.

169
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:35,729
I've got one. It's probably going to

170
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:38,733
get us all disintegrated, 
but either way it's armageddon.

171
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:42,437
So, here it is. 
First, we form two teams.

172
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:46,974
Team A will enter the ship here,
through this top port. I theorize

173
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:49,176
this will lead directly
into the reactor core,

174
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:51,278
which we'll have to blow
to detonate the ship.

175
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:54,516
Great! As long as I'm not
a part of team A, I'm cool.

176
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,652
Team B will have to break
into the hangar, smash through

177
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:00,088
and take out the Makluan
Overlord in his throne room.

178
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:02,524
Both missions are critical to success.

179
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,662
He-he. On second thought,
I'll sign up for team A.

180
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:08,530
So, who are the teams?

181
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:11,534
The strongest and most armored
members: Iron Man, War Machine,

182
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:13,869
Rescue and Hulk will
deal with the Overlord.

183
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:16,205
The rest of us will take
out the reactor core.

184
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:19,108
Iron Man! Uh...
Tony, wait.

185
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:24,880
I just, uh, want to talk to you before...
we head off to certain doom.

186
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:28,616
Pep... uh, Rescue,
now isn't the best time, seriously.

187
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:31,652
I, I have to contact my Dad.
Dad, come in.

188
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:32,954
<i>Are you there?</i>

189
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:36,824
I'm here, son. The Makluan
energy disruptor is finally a go.

190
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:41,530
Theoretically, it's 80 times
more powerful than the old canon.

191
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:44,066
Uh, just haven't tested it yet.

192
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,336
<i>So, you don't know if it works?
That's comforting.</i>

193
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,375
Huh, right... I have to align
it to the Stark 1 satellite.

194
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:55,311
It will help pinpoint the
beam to a remote target.

195
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:57,847
<i>Great. The only problem
is, how do you get it there?</i>

196
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:03,787
Hmm. I need a rocket ship and...
a space suit.

197
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:07,857
Uh-oh. I'm getting a wide
frequency transmission

198
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:10,260
from the Makluan mothership.
This doesn't look good.

199
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:13,063
I'll project it with my
holographic projector beam.

200
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:15,565
<i>Simians of Earth,</i>

201
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,502
<i>I am the supreme Overlord
of the Makluan race.</i>

202
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:23,106
<i>You have proved
yourselves inferior beings.</i>

203
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,073
<i>Your military is weak,</i>

204
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:28,676
<i>Your heroes 
nothing but lowly cowards.</i>

205
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,079
<i>I am here to rid the universe</i>

206
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:33,886
<i>of the thoughtless, primitive,
self-centered race of... </i>

207
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,531
This is it.
We have to move now!

208
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:39,972
I'm down. Let's do this!

209
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,978
Heroes unite!

210
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:44,949
Let's go beat up some bad guys.

211
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:48,756
But do not fear, humans.

212
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,325
The residual energy from
your exploding planet

213
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:53,894
will be recycled to fuel our ship.

214
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:56,931
Long live the Makluan empire!

215
00:12:56,965 --> 00:13:00,135
Never!

216
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:01,636
[laughing]

217
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:04,840
Your heroism is only blind eloquence.

218
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:08,978
Now I shall liquefy the
flesh from your bones!

219
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:11,613
[screaming]

220
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:15,317
What? Intruders?
The human warriors are back!

221
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,558
[roaring]

222
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:29,196
Let's show these aliens
how we do things on Earth.

223
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,232
Get 'em!

224
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:37,880
It's all or nothing. 
We have to get to the Overlord.  

225
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:39,915
Yeah, but we don't even
know how to find him.

226
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:45,721
Whoa! Hulk, take out those
robo-dragon... uh, whats-its!

227
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,756
With pleasure!

228
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:01,570
Eat this!

229
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:04,039
[screaming]

230
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:18,455
If there's one thing I hate more
than aliens, it's alien machines.

231
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:24,561
- Finally!
- Dad, come in.

232
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,430
How's everything going
inside the space armor?

233
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:30,234
Great, son, handles like a charm.
I'm almost at the satellite.

234
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:37,506
Attaching now.
It's going to take about 20 minutes.

235
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,141
20 minutes?!

236
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:41,143
Ah!

237
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:44,879
- Thanks, Rescue!
- Now we're even. Hah!

238
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,715
The soldiers are down. Now what?

239
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:48,750
We've got to find the throne room.

240
00:14:52,055 --> 00:14:54,323
I hope this works!

241
00:14:56,894 --> 00:15:00,563
If there's one thing Iron
Man knows, it's technology.

242
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:14,375
The reactor core.
I, too, have explosives to donate.

243
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:17,545
Um, guys, we're not exactly alone here.

244
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:22,250
Keep moving! We have to break
this line to get to the reactor.

245
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:25,987
[groaning]

246
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:28,055
[screaming]

247
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,091
Consider the line broken.

248
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:39,099
Hah, these guys aren't so tough. Ah!

249
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:42,202
Rick!

250
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:45,439
Okay. 
Just a bit dizzy for you, babe.

251
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,209
Can you cut the jokes
and take this seriously?

252
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:50,010
You love it.

253
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:52,412
Ah!

254
00:15:58,118 --> 00:16:01,787
Come, Nick Fury.
Let us plant some seeds.

255
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:03,922
I like the way you think, Panther.

256
00:16:03,956 --> 00:16:06,358
They are here.

257
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:09,694
So, I guess he keeps you as
his pet rat now, huh, Gene?

258
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:12,464
I'm doing everything I
can to help, okay, Stark?

259
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:16,101
- I never wanted this.
- Well, this is where your greed got us.

260
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:19,705
You're no protector of the planet.
You're its destroyer!

261
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:21,874
Aptly said, Iron Man.

262
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:26,379
Come, let us battle. I seek a challenge.

263
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:29,416
That makes two of us,
 lizard breath. Uh!

264
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,555
Whoa! The Makluan Overlord's
just as strong as the Hulk?

265
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,591
Yeah, 'cause of the rings.

266
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,667
You're done, baby!

267
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:50,136
Never!

268
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:57,245
Hah! The great grey beast was
another monkey. How appropriate.

269
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,749
And now, here stands our
three armor-wearing animals.

270
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:04,285
I'll say one thing, Overlord.

271
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,787
I'd rather be a monkey
than an extinct dinosaur!

272
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:13,762
He's too strong!

273
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:16,197
Time to bust out the bunker buster!

274
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,037
My turn.

275
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:28,511
- Are you setting the timer?
- Just about to... uh!

276
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:34,449
The timer still needs to get set.

277
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:36,485
Hawkeye, can you...
already on it.

278
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,457
Come on. Let's move!

279
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:44,994
There's more of them coming.
I sense an entire army!

280
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:47,029
Back to the Quinjet, now!

281
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:55,271
Hah! 
Hah, stupid alligator!

282
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:01,011
You're finished, Overlord!
We're going to... uh...

283
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,746
we're here to put an end to you!

284
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,216
Oh, great. 
Might as well give up now.

285
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,517
We're taking you down.

286
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,586
[laughing]

287
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,255
Dad, what's going on with
that Makluan disruptor?

288
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,190
<i>I'm having serious trouble, son.</i>

289
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,759
I can't calibrate the
targeting system to the ship.

290
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,061
<i>Just activate the beam, Dad. 
I've got a plan.</i>

291
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,430
<i>I'm going to control the
targeting system with Extremis.</i>

292
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,999
<i>I may not be able to
control Makluan tech,</i>

293
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,536
but that doesn't mean I don't
have a few tricks up my sleeve.

294
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,083
[groaning] 
What is this?

295
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,286
It's called Extremis.
I'm shutting you down, lizard!

296
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,389
No! The rings!

297
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:47,426
Useless!
This can't be!

298
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,395
No!

299
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,798
No!

300
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,536
We did it! He's down!
The rings are temporarily disabled!

301
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,871
<i>Iron Man, come in.</i>

302
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,740
You have 60 seconds to get out
before the whole place blows!

303
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,911
- We have to go!
- Wait! Where's Gene?

304
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:07,648
[laughing]

305
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:11,385
Oh, no.

306
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,422
The Mandarin has returned!

307
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:22,563
The rings belong to me!

308
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:24,432
Get out! 
The place is going to blow.

309
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,468
I'll take care of the Overlord.

310
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:33,343
- Gene, get them out!
- Tony, no!

311
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:42,820
Must shut down the power core!

312
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,725
Forget it. It's over!

313
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:54,933
<i>Warning. 
Reactor core at critical mass.</i>

314
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,503
<i>Detonation in 5 seconds.</i>

315
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:58,571
Uh-oh.

316
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,383
Tony? Oh, no! 
No!

317
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:27,032
Everyone can relax.
The alien menace has ended.

318
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:28,967
Tony, Stark! 
Way to go, Tony!

319
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:33,737
- Oh, man!
- Well, the more, the merrier.

320
00:20:35,574 --> 00:20:37,342
[people cheering]

321
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:40,078
- Huh?
- Ooh.

322
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:43,248
I can't believe it! 
All this, time?

323
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,352
James Rhodes, you are
grounded until you're 22.

324
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:49,221
Right after I give you the
biggest hug you've ever had!

325
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:51,090
I have to say, Patricia,

326
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,692
I always knew my
daughter was a superhero.

327
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:57,897
Oh, I love you, too!
And it's Pepper, Dad.

328
00:20:57,931 --> 00:20:59,932
Or even better, Rescue!

329
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,101
[chuckling]

330
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:09,676
Tony. You saved the day, and
everyone knows you're Iron Man.

331
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,378
Uh, yeah. 
Yeah, long story.

332
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:16,949
- You did it, Dad. You're a hero.
- I think that would be you, son.

333
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,286
He's right. Without your plan,
we wouldn't have stood a chance.

334
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,755
You're a natural leader, son.

335
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,191
Can I just say one thing to you?

336
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:28,294
You could, but there's something
I'd like to say to you first.

337
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,730
Huh, another diversion, hey?

338
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,600
Oh, Tony.

339
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:37,303
Okay, you guys are embarrassing
me. I'm feeling queasy here.

340
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,940
Can I just ask one thing?
What happened to Gene?

341
00:21:44,745 --> 00:21:48,515
Something tells me
we won't be hearing from him.

342
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:52,419
You were right, mother.

343
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:54,821
Perhaps I'm not supposed
to rule the world.

344
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,426
<i>Perhaps I'm supposed to protect it.</i>

345
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:09,302
So, the entire world knows we're
superheroes. What do we do now?

346
00:22:09,337 --> 00:22:12,906
Well, at least we don't have to lie
to the parental units anymore...

347
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:16,977
but yeah, this is going to be
a big change in our lives.

348
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:21,894
For the better.
For once, things feel good...

349
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:25,319
hopeful.
Like everything's right in the world.

350
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:28,022
Let's just make sure
it stays that way.
