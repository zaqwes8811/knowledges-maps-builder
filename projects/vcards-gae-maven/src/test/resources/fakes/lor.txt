6 A. Seriously? I look at the boarding pass in my hand, its large type announcing my seat assignment, and wonder if Crayton chose this seat on
purpose. It could be a coincidence, but the way things have gone recently, I am not a big believer in coincidences. I wouldn't be surprised if Marina
sat down behind me in row seven, and Ella made her way back to row ten. But, no, the two girls drop down beside me without saying a word, and
join me in studying each person boarding the plane. Being hunted, you are constantly on guard. Who knows when the Mogadorians might appear.
Crayton will board last, after he's watched to see who else gets on the plane, and only once he feels the flight is absolutely secure.
I raise the window shade and watch the ground crew hustle back and forth under the plane. The city of Barcelona is a faint outline in the distance.
Marina's knee bounces furiously up and down next to mine. The battle against an army of Mogadorians yesterday at the lake, the death of her
Cêpan, finding her Chest – and now, it's the first time in almost ten years that she's left the town where she spent her childhood. She's nervous.
'Everything okay?' I ask. My newly blond hair falls into my face and startles me. I forgot I dyed it this morning. It's just one of many changes in the
last forty-eight hours.
'Everyone looks normal,' Marina whispers, keeping her eyes on the crowded aisle. 'We're safe, as far as I can tell.'
'Good, but that's not what I meant.' I gently set my foot on hers and she stops bouncing her knee. She offers me a quick apologetic smile before
returning to her close watch of each boarding passenger. A few seconds later, her knee starts bouncing again. I just shake my head.
I feel sorry for Marina. She was locked up in an isolated orphanage with a Cêpan who refused to train her. Her Cêpan had lost sight of why we
are here on Earth in the first place. I'm doing my best to help her, to fill in the gaps. I can train her to learn how to control her strength and when to
use her developing Legacies. But first I'm trying to show her that it's okay to trust me.
The Mogadorians will pay for what they've done. For taking so many whom we've loved, here on Earth and on Lorien. It's my personal mission to
destroy every last one of them, and I'll be sure Marina gets her revenge too. Not only did she just lose her best friend, Héctor, back at the lake, but,
like me, her Cêpan was killed right in front of her. We will both carry that with us forever.
'How is it down there, Six?' Ella asks, leaning over Marina.
I turn back towards the window. The men below the plane begin to clear away their equipment, conducting a few last-minute checks. 'So far, so
good.'
My seat is directly over the wing, which is comforting to me. On more than one occasion I've had to use my Legacies to help a pilot out of a jam.
Once, over southern Mexico, I used my telekinesis to push the plane a dozen degrees to the right, only seconds before crashing into the side of a
mountain. Last year I got 124 passengers safely through a vicious thunderstorm over Kansas by surrounding the plane with an impervious cloud of
cool air. We shot through the storm like a bullet through a balloon.
When the ground crew moves on to the next plane, I follow Ella's gaze towards the front of the aisle. We're both impatient for Crayton to board.
That will mean everything is okay, at least for now. Every seat is full but the one behind Ella. Where is he? I glance out at the wing again, scanning
the area for anything out of the ordinary.
I lean down and shove my backpack under my seat. It's practically empty, so it folds down easily. Crayton bought it for me at the airport. The three
of us need to look like normal teenagers, he says, like high school students on a field trip. That's why there's a biology textbook on Ella's lap.
'Six?' Marina asks. I hear her buckle and unbuckle her seat belt nervously.
'Yeah?' I respond.
'You've flown before, right?'
Marina is only a year older than I am. But with her solemn, thoughtful eyes and her new, sophisticated haircut that falls just below her shoulders,
she can easily pass for an adult. Right now, however, she bites her nails and pulls her knees up to her chest like a scared child.
'Yes,' I say. 'It's not so bad. In fact, once you relax, it's kind of awesome.'
Sitting there on the plane, my thoughts turn in the direction of my own Cêpan, Katarina. Not that I ever flew with her. But when I was nine years old,
we had a close call in a Cleveland alley with a Mogadorian that left us both shaken and covered in a thick layer of ash. Katarina moved us to
Southern California after that. Our crumbling, two-story bungalow was near the beach, practically in the shadow of Los Angeles International Airport.
A hundred planes roared overhead every hour, always interrupting Katarina's teaching, as well as the little free time I had to spend with my only
friend, a skinny girl next door named Ashley.
I lived under those airplanes for seven months. They were my alarm clock in the morning, screaming directly over my bed as the sun rose. At night
they were ominous ghosts telling me to stay awake, to be prepared to rip off my sheets and jump in the car in a matter of seconds. Since Katarina
didn't let me stray far from the house, the airplanes were also the sound track of my afternoons.
On one of those afternoons, as the vibrations from an enormous plane overhead shook the lemonade in our plastic cups, Ashley said, 'Me and
my mom are going to visit my grandparents next month. I can't wait! Have you ever been on a plane?' Ashley was always talking about all the
places she went and things she did with her family. She knew Katarina and I stayed close to home and she liked to brag.
'Not really,' I said.
'What do you mean, “Not really”? You've either been on a plane, or you haven't. Just admit it. You haven't.'
I remember feeling my face burn with embarrassment. Her challenge hit its mark. I finally said, 'No, I've never been on an airplane.' I wanted to tell
her I've been on something much bigger, something much more impressive than a little airplane. I wanted her to know I came to Earth on a ship
from another planet called Lorien and the trip had covered more than 100 million miles. I didn't, though, because I knew I had to keep Lorien secret.
Ashley laughed at me. Without saying good-bye, she left to wait for her dad to come home from work.
'Why haven't we ever been on a plane?' I asked Katarina that night as she peered out the blinds of my bedroom window.
'Six,' she said, turning to me before correcting herself. 'I mean, Veronica. It's too dangerous for us to travel by plane. We'd be trapped up there.
You know what could happen if we were thousands of miles in the air and then found out Mogs had followed us on board?'
I knew exactly what could happen. I could picture the chaos, the other passengers screaming and ducking under their seats as a couple of huge
alien soldiers barreled down the aisle with swords. But that didn't stop me from wanting to do something so normal, so human, as to fly on a plane
from one city to the next. I'd spent all my time on Earth unable to do the things other kids my age took for granted. We rarely even stayed in one
place long enough for me to meet other kids, let alone make friends – Ashley was the first girl Katarina even allowed over to our house. Sometimes,
like in California, I didn't even attend school, if Katarina thought it was safer.
I knew why all this was necessary, of course. Usually, I didn't let it bother me. But Katarina could tell that Ashley's superior attitude had gotten
under my skin. My silence the following days must have cut through her, because to my surprise she bought us two round-trip airline tickets to
Denver. The destination didn't matter – she knew I just wanted the experience.
I couldn't wait to tell Ashley.
But on the day of the trip, standing outside the airport, Katarina hesitated. She seemed nervous. She ran her hand through her short black hair.
She had dyed and cut it the night before, just before making herself a new ID. A family of five walked around us on the curb, dragging heavy
luggage, and to my left a tearful mother said good-bye to her two young daughters. I wanted nothing more than to join in, to be a part of this
everyday scene. Katarina watched everyone around us while I fidgeted impatiently by her side.
'No,' Katarina finally said. 'We're not going. I'm sorry, Veronica, but it's not worth it.'
We drove home in silence, letting the screaming engines of the planes passing overhead speak for us. When we got out of the car on our street, I
saw Ashley sitting on her front steps. She looked at me walking towards our house and mouthed the word liar . The humiliation was almost too
much to bear.
But, really, I was a liar. It's ironic. Lying was all I had done since I'd arrived on Earth. My name, where I was from, where my father was, why I
couldn't stay the night at another girl's house – lying was all I knew and it was what kept me alive. But when Ashley called me a liar the one time I
was telling someone the truth, I was unspeakably angry. I stormed up to my room, slammed the door, and punched the wall.
To my surprise, my fist went straight through.
Katarina slammed my door open, wielding a kitchen knife and ready to strike. She thought the noise she'd heard must be Mogs. When she saw
what I had done to the wall, she realized that something had changed with me. She lowered the blade and smiled. 'Today's not the day you get on a
plane, but it is the day you're going to start your training.'
Seven years later, sitting on this plane with Marina and Ella, I hear Katarina's voice in my head. 'We'd be trapped up there .' But I'm ready for that
possibility now, in ways that Katarina and I weren't.
I've since flown dozens of times, and everything has gone fine. However, this is the first time I've done it without using my invisibility Legacy to
sneak on board. I know I'm much stronger now. And I'm getting stronger by the day. If a couple of Mog soldiers charged at me from the front of the
plane, they wouldn't be dealing with a meek young girl. I know what I'm capable of; I am a soldier now, a warrior. I am someone to fear, not hunt.
Marina lets go of her knees and sits up straight, releasing a long breath. In a barely audible voice, she says, 'I'm scared. I just want to get in the
air.'
'You'll be fine,' I say in a low voice.
She smiles, and I smile back at her. Marina proved herself to be a strong ally with amazing Legacies on the battlefield yesterday. She can
breathe under water, see in the dark, and heal the sick and wounded. Like all Garde, she also has telekinesis. And because we're so close in order
– I'm Number Six and she's Number Seven – our bond is special. When the charm still held and we had to be killed in order, the Mogadorians
would have had to get through me before they could get to her. And they never would have gotten through me.
Ella sits silently on the other side of Marina. As we continue to wait for Crayton, she opens the biology book on her lap and stares at the pages.
Our charade does not demand this level of concentration and I'm about to lean over and tell her, but then I see she isn't reading at all. She is trying
to turn the page with her mind, trying to use telekinesis, but nothing's happening.
Ella is what Crayton calls an Aeternus, someone born with the ability to move back and forth between ages. But she's still young and her
Legacies have not yet developed. They will come in their own time, no matter how impatiently she wills them to develop now.
Ella came to Earth on another ship, one I didn't know existed until John Smith, Number Four, told me he saw it in his visions. She was just a baby,
which means she's almost twelve now. Crayton says he is her unofficial Cêpan, since there wasn't time for him to be officially appointed to her. He,
like all of our Cêpans, has a duty to help Ella develop her Legacies. He told us that there was also a small herd of Chimæra on their ship, Loric
animals capable of shifting forms and battling alongside us.
I'm happy she's here. After Numbers One, Two, and Three died, only six of us remained. With Ella, we number seven. Lucky number seven, if you
believe in luck. I don't, though. I believe in strength.
Finally, Crayton squeezes down the aisle, carrying a black briefcase. He's wearing eyeglasses and a brown suit that looks too big for him. Under
his strong chin is a blue bow tie. He's supposed to be our teacher.
'Hello, girls,' he says, stopping next to us.
'Hi, Mr. Collins,' Ella responds.
'It's a full flight,' Marina says. That's code for everyone on board looks okay. To tell him everything on the ground appears normal, I say, 'I'm going
to try to sleep.'
He nods and takes his seat directly behind Ella. Leaning forward between Marina and Ella, he says, 'Use your time on the plane wisely, please.
Study hard.'
That means, don't let your guard down.
I didn't know what to think of Crayton when we first met. He's stern and quick tempered, but his heart seems to be in the right place and his
knowledge of the world and current events is incredible. Official or not, he has taken his Cêpan role seriously. He says he would die for any one of
us. He will do anything to defeat the Mogadorians; anything to exact our revenge. I believe him on all counts.
However, it's with reluctance that I'm on this plane headed to India at all. I wanted to get back to the United States as soon as possible, to get
back to John and Sam. But yesterday, standing on top of the dam overlooking the carnage at the lake, Crayton told us that Setrákus Ra, the
powerful Mogadorian leader, would be on Earth soon, if he wasn't here already. That Setrákus's arrival was a sign that the Mogadorians
understood we were a threat, and we should expect them to step up their campaign to kill us. Setrákus is more or less invincible. Only Pittacus
Lore, the most powerful of all the Lorien Elders, would have been able to defeat him. We were horrified. What did that mean for the rest of us then, if
he was invincible? When Marina asked this, asked how any of us could possibly stand a chance of defeating him, Crayton told us even more
shocking news, knowledge that all the Cêpans had been entrusted with. One of the Garde – one of us – was supposed to hold the same powers as
Pittacus. One of us was supposed to grow as strong as he had been, and would be able to beat Setrákus Ra. We just had to hope that that Garde
wasn't One, Two, or Three, that it was one of the ones still alive. If so, we had a chance. We just had to wait and see who it was, and hope that these
powers showed themselves soon.
Crayton thinks he's found him – the Garde who holds Pittacus' powers.
'I've read about a boy who seems to have extraordinary powers in India,' he told us then. 'He lives high up in the Himalayas. Some believe him to
be the Hindu god Vishnu reincarnated, others believe the boy is an alien imposter with the power to physically alter his form.'
'Like me, Papa?' Ella had asked. Their fatherdaughter relationship took me by surprise. I couldn't help but feel a touch of jealousy – jealousy that
she still had her Cêpan, someone to turn to for guidance.
'He's not changing ages, Ella. He's changing into beasts and other beings. The more I read about him, the more I believe he is a member of the
Garde, and the more I believe he may be the one to possess all of the Legacies, the one who can fight and kill Setrákus. We need to find him as
soon as possible.'
I don't want to be on a wild goose chase for another member of the Garde right now. I know where John is, or where he is supposed to be. I can
hear Katarina's voice, urging me to follow my in stincts, which are telling me we should connect with John first before anything else. It's the least
risky move. Certainly less risky than flying around the world based on Crayton's hunch and rumors on the Internet.
'It could be a trap,' I said. 'What if those stories were planted for us to find so we would do exactly this?'
'I understand your concern, Six, but, trust me, I'm the master of planting stories on the Internet. This is no plant. There are far too many sources
pointing to this boy in India. He hasn't been running. He hasn't been hiding. He's just being , and he appears to be very powerful. If he is one of you,
then we must get to him before the Mogadorians do. We'll go to America to meet up with Number Four as soon as this trip is over,' Crayton said.
Marina looked at me. She wanted to find John almost as much as I did – she'd been following the news of his exploits online and she'd had a
similar feeling in her gut that he was one of us, a feeling I had confirmed for her. 'Promise?' she asked Crayton. He nodded.
The captain's voice breaks through my reverie. We're about to take off. I want so badly to redirect the plane to point it towards West Virginia.
Towards John and Sam. I hope they're okay. Images of John being held in a prison cell keep entering my mind. I never should have told him about
the Mog base in the mountain, but John wanted to get his Chest back and there was no way I could convince him to leave it behind.
The plane taxis down the runway and Marina grabs my wrist. 'I really wish Héctor was here. He'd have something smart to say right now to make
me feel better.'
'It's okay,' Ella says, holding Marina's other hand. 'You have us.'
'And I'll work on something smart to say,' I offer.
'Thanks,' Marina says, though it sounds like something between a hiccup and a gulp. I let her nails dig into my wrist. I give her a supportive smile,
and a minute later we're airborne.
2.
I've been in and out of consciousness for the past two days, rolling back and forth in a hallucinating sickness. The effects from the blue force field
outside the Mogadorians' mountain have lingered far longer than Nine told me they would, both mentally and physically. Every few minutes, my
muscles seize and sear with pain.
I try to distract myself from the agony by looking around the tiny bedroom of this decaying, abandoned house. Nine couldn't have picked a more
disgusting place for us to hide. I can't trust my eyes. I watch the pattern on the yellow wallpaper come to life, the design marching like ants over
patches of mold. The cracked ceiling appears to breathe, rising and falling at frightening speeds. A large jagged hole in the wall separates the
bedroom and living room, as if someone tossed a sledgehammer through it. Smashed beer cans are strewn around the room, and the baseboards
have been torn to shreds by animals. I've been hearing things rustling in the trees outside the house, but I'm too weak to be alarmed. Last night I
woke to find a cockroach on my cheek. I barely had the energy to swat it off.
'Hey, Four?' I hear through the hole in the wall. 'You awake or what? It's time for lunch and your food's getting cold.'
I heave myself to my feet. My head spins as I stumble through the doorway into what used to be the living room, and I collapse on the dingy gray
carpet. I know Nine's in here, but I can't keep my eyes open long enough to find him. All I want is to lay my head in Sarah's lap. Or in Six's. Either
one. I can't think straight.
Something warm hits my shoulder. I roll over to see Nine sitting on the ceiling above me, his long black hair hanging down into the room. He's
gnawing on something and his hands are greasy.
'Where are we again?' I ask. The sunlight coming through the windows is too much and I close my eyes. I need more sleep. I need something,
anything, to clear my head and regain my strength. My fingers fumble over my blue pendant, hoping to somehow gather energy through it, but it
remains cold against my chest.
'The northern part of West Virginia,' Nine says between bites. 'Ran out of gas, remember?'
'Barely,' I whisper. 'Where's Bernie Kosar?'
'Outside. That one is always on patrol. He is one cool animal. Tell me, Four, how did you of all the Garde end up with him?'
I crawl into the corner of the room and push my back up against a wall. ' BK was with me on Lorien. His name was Hadley back then. I guess
Henri thought it would be good to bring him along for the trip.'
Nine throws a tiny bone across the ceiling. 'I had a couple of Chimæras as a kid too. Don't remember their names, but I can still see them running
around our house tearing stuff up. They died in the war, protecting my family.' Nine is silent for a moment, clenching his jaw. This is the first time I've
seen him act anything other than tough. It's nice to see, even if it's short lived. 'At least, that's what my Cêpan told me, anyway.'
I stare at my bare feet. 'What was your Cêpan's name?'
'Sandor,' he says, standing up on the ceiling. He's wearing my shoes. 'It's weird. I literally can't remember the last time I said his name out loud.
Some days, I can barely picture his face.' Nine's voice hardens, and he closes his eyes. 'But that's how it goes, I guess. Whatever. They're the
expendable ones.'
His last sentence sends shockwaves through me. 'Henri was not expendable, and neither was Sandor! No Loric was ever expendable. And give
me back my shoes!'
Nine kicks my shoes into the middle of the floor, then takes his time walking first along the ceiling and then down the back wall. 'All right, all right. I
know he wasn't expendable, man. Sometimes it's just easier to think of him that way, you know? Truth is, Sandor was an amazing Cêpan.' Nine
reaches the floor and towers over me. I forgot how tall he is. Intimidating. He shoves a handful of what he's been eating in my face. 'You want some
of this or not? Because I'm about to finish it off.'
The sight of it makes my stomach churn. 'What is it?'
'Barbecued rabbit. Nature's finest.'
I don't dare open my mouth to respond, afraid that I might get sick. Instead, I stumble back towards the bedroom, ignoring the laughter that follows
me. The bedroom door is so warped it's nearly impossible to close, but I wedge it into the doorframe as tightly as I can. I lie down on the floor, using
my sweatshirt as a pillow, and think about how I ended up here, ended up like this. Without Henri. Without Sam. Sam is my best friend, and I can't
believe we left him behind. As thoughtful and loyal and supportive as Sam is – traveling and fighting alongside me for the last several months – Nine
is so very not. He's reckless, arrogant, selfish and just flat-out rude. I picture Sam, back in the Mog cave, a gun rocking against his shoulder as a
dozen Mogadorian soldiers swarmed him. I couldn't get to him. I couldn't save him. I should have fought harder, ran faster. I should have ignored
Nine and gone back to Sam. He would have done that for me. The immense amount of guilt I feel paralyzes me, until I finally fall asleep.
It's dark. I'm no longer in a house in the mountains with Nine. I no longer feel the painful effects of the blue force field. My head is finally clear,
although I don't know where I am, or how I got here. When I shout for help, I can't hear my voice even though I feel my lips moving. I shuffle ahead,
hands out in front of me. My palms suddenly start to glow with my Lumen. The light is dim at first, but quickly grows into two powerful beams.
'John.' A hoarse whisper says my name.
I whip my hands around to see where I am, but the light reveals only empty darkness. I'm entering a vision. I angle my palms towards the ground
so my Lumen will light my way, and start towards the voice. The hoarse whisper keeps repeating my name over and over. It sounds young and full of
fear. Then comes another voice, gruff and staccato, barking orders.
The voices become clearer. It's Sam, my lost friend, and Setrákus Ra, my worst enemy. I can tell I'm nearing the Mogadorian base. I can see the
blue force field, the source of so much pain. For some reason, I know it won't hurt me now, and I don't hesitate to pass through it. When I do, it's not
my screams I hear, but Sam's. His tortured voice fills my head as I enter the mountain and move through its mazelike tunnels. I see the charred
remains of our recent battle, from when I tossed a ball of green lava at the gas tanks at the mountain's bottom, sending a sea of fire raging
upwards. I move through the testing.testing.main cavernous hall and its spiraling ledges. I step onto the arched stone bridge Sam and I so recently crossed under
the cloak of invisibility. I keep going, passing through tributaries and corridors, all while being forced to listen to my best friend's crippling howls.
I know where I'm going before I get there. The steady incline of the floor lands me in the wide room lined with prison cells.
There they are. Setrákus Ra is standing in the middle of the room. He is huge and truly revolting looking. And there's Sam. He's suspended
inside a small spherical cage next to him. His own, private torture bubble. Sam's arms are stretched high above his head and his legs are splayed,
held in place with chains. A series of pipes are dripping steaming liquid onto various parts of Sam's body. Blood has pooled and dried under the
cage.
I stop ten feet away from them. Setrákus Ra senses my presence and turns around, the three Loric pendants from other Garde children he has
killed dangling from his massive neck. The scar circling his throat pulses with a dark energy.
'We missed each other,' Setrákus Ra growls.
I open my mouth but nothing comes out. Sam's blue eyes turn in my direction, but I can't tell if he sees me.
More hot liquid drips from the pipes, hitting Sam in the wrists, chest, knees and feet. A thick stream flows onto his cheek and rolls down his neck.
Seeing Sam tortured finally gives me a voice.
'Let him go!' I shout.
Setrákus Ra's eyes harden. The pendants around his neck glow and mine responds, lighting up as well. The blue Loralite gem is hot against my
skin, and then it suddenly bursts into flames, my Legacy taking over. I allow the fire to crawl along my shoulders.
'I'll let him go,' he says, 'if you come back to the mountain, and fight me.'
I glance quickly over at Sam and see that he has lost his battle with the pain and has blacked out, chin resting on his chest.
Setrákus Ra points to Sam's withered body and says, 'You must decide. If you don't come, I'll kill him and then I'll kill the rest of them. If you do, I'll
let them all live.'
I hear a voice yelling my name, telling me I have to move. Nine. I sit up with a gasp and my eyes snap open. I'm covered in a thin layer of sweat. I
stare through the jagged hole of broken drywall and it takes me a few seconds to get my bearings.
'Dude! Get up!' Nine yells from the other side of the door. 'There's a ton of stuff we need to do!'
I get to my knees and fumble around my neck for my pendant. I squeeze it as hard as I can, trying to get Sam's screams out of my head. The
bedroom door swings open. Nine stands in the doorway, wiping his face with the back of his hand. 'Seriously, bro. Get your shit together. We need
to get out of here.'
3.
The air is thick and heavy as we leave the airport in New Delhi. We walk along the curb, Marina's Chest under Crayton's arm. Cars inch past on
the congested roadways, horns blaring. The four of us are on the alert for signs of trouble, even the slightest indication we're being followed. We
reach an intersection and are jostled on all sides. Women shove by with tall baskets balanced on their heads; men with buckets of water draped
over their dark shoulders shout for us to get out of the way. The smells, the noise, the physical proximity of the busy world around us could
overwhelm us. We stay vigilant.
There's a bustling market on the other side of the street that looks like it stretches for miles. Children crowd us with trinkets for sale, and we
politely turn down their wood carvings and ivory jewelry. I'm amazed by the organized chaos of it all, happy to see life moving along in what seems
to be routine, happy for this moment away from our war.
'Where do we go now?' Marina asks, raising her voice to be heard above the noise.
Crayton scans the crowd crossing the street. 'Now that we're away from the airports and its cameras, I suppose we can find a –' A taxi skids to a
stop in front of us, a cloud of dirt billowing from its tires, and the driver pushes the passenger door open. 'Taxi,' Crayton finishes.
'Please. Where can I take you?' the driver asks. He's young and looks nervous, like this is his first day on the job. Marina must either relate to his
mood or be desperate to get away from the crowds, because she jumps right into the back of the car and scoots all the way over.
Crayton gives the driver an address as he folds himself into the front seat. Ella and I pile into the back, next to Marina.
The driver nods, and then promptly slams his foot down on the accelerator, throwing us all back against the cracked plastic seat. New Delhi
becomes a blur of bright colors and fleeting sounds. We zip past cars and rickshaws, goats and cows. We take corners so fast I'm surprised it isn't
on two wheels. We miss clipping pedestrians by a hair's breadth so many times I lose count. Then I decide it's probably best if I don't look so
closely. We're tossed back and forth against each other. The only way we keep ourselves from falling onto the car's dirty floor is by clinging to one
another and anything else we can grab.
The taxi jumps a curb at one point, shooting down a stretch of narrow sidewalk to avoid stalled traffic. It's totally crazy and I admit it I love every
second of it. Years of running, hiding, and fighting have turned me into a total adrenaline junkie. Marina plants her hands on the headrest in front of
her, refusing to look out the windows while Ella leans over her, trying to take it all in.
With no warning, the driver jerks the taxi violently down a road that runs behind a long row of warehouse buildings. The street is flanked by dozens
of men with AK - 47 s. Our driver nods at them as we fly past. Crayton looks over his shoulder at me. His concerned face makes the knot in my
stomach grow larger. The road is suddenly and noticeably absent of traffic.
'Where are you taking us?' Crayton demands of the driver. 'We need to go south and you're headed north.' Marina's head jerks up and she and
Ella look over at me questioningly.
All of a sudden the car screeches to a halt and the driver dives out the door, rolling away from the taxi. A dozen vans and covered trucks surround
the car. Each vehicle has a similar smudge of red paint on the doors, but I can't quite make out what it is. Men in street clothes jump out of the vans,
machine guns ready.
Now the adrenaline really starts to flow. It always kicks in before a fight. I look over at Marina and see the terrified look on her face, but I know she
will take her cues from me. I keep myself calm. 'You guys ready? Marina? Ella?' They nod.
Crayton puts his hand up. 'Wait! Look at the trucks, Six. Look at their doors!'
'What?' Ella asks. 'What's on their doors?'
The men come closer, their shouts growing urgent. I'm too focused on the imminent danger to consider what Crayton is talking about. When
people with guns threaten me, or the ones I love, I'll make sure they regret it.
Marina looks out the window. 'Six, look! Are those number –'
I finally see what they're all staring at just as the door next to Marina is whipped open. The red smudges on the truck doors are all eights.
'Out!' the man yells.
'Do as he says,' Crayton says under his breath, voice calm. 'For now, we do what they want.'
We carefully get out of the taxi, our hands up, all four of us transfixed by the red numbers painted on the truck doors. We must be moving too
slowly because one of the men leans forward and impatiently yanks Ella forward. She loses her balance and falls down. I can't help myself. I don't
care if they're with Number Eight or not, you don't knock a twelve-year-old girl to the ground. I heave the man into the air with my mind, tossing him
onto the roof of a warehouse across the street. The other men panic, whipping their guns around and screaming to one another.
Crayton grabs my arm. 'Let's find out why they're here and if they know where Number Eight is. If we need to, we'll strike with full force then.' Still
furious, I shake off his hand but I nod. He's right – we don't know what they want with us. Better to find out before they're unable to explain.
A tall bearded man wearing a red beret steps out of one of the covered trucks and slowly walks towards us. His smile is confident, but his eyes
are wary. A small pistol sticks out of his shoulder holster.
'Good afternoon and welcome,' he says in thickly accented English. 'I am Commander Grahish Sharma of the rebel group Vishnu Nationalist
Eight. We come in peace.'
'Then what are the guns for?' Crayton asks.
'The guns were to convince you to come with us. We know who you are and would never engage in a battle with you. We know we'd lose. Vishnu
told us you are all powerful like him.'
'How did you find us?' Crayton demands. 'And who is Vishnu?'
'Vishnu is the all-pervading essence of all beings, the master of the past, present and future, the Supreme God, and Preserver of the Universe.
He told us you would be four in total, three young girls and one man. He asked me to convey a message to you.'
'What's the message?' I say.
Commander Sharma clears his throat and smiles. ' 'His message is: “I am Number Eight. Welcome to India. Please come and see me as soon
as you can.” '
4.
The sky is gray and heavy. The woods are dark and cold. Most of the leaves have fallen from the trees and lie dead on the ground. Nine walks
ahead of me, scanning the landscape for game. 'You know, that rabbit was better than I thought it would be.' He produces a short piece of vine from
his pocket and pulls his shaggy black hair into a ponytail. 'I'll make it again tonight if you're interested.'
'I think I'll figure something else out.'
He looks surprised at my squeamishness. 'Scared of fresh kill? You have to eat if you want to get your strength up. I don't know why, but our
healing stones don't do jack shit for your pain. And, you know, this sickness thing of yours is a real drag. Time's a-wasting, dude. We need to get
you better and we've got to get out of here.'
I know how weak my body is by how tired I feel as we walk. We're only a couple hundred yards from our ramshackle house and I'm exhausted
already. I want so badly to be back there, sleeping. But I know I won't feel normal again if I don't get off my butt and move.
'Hey Nine, let me tell you about this dream I just had,' I say.
He snorts. 'A dream? No thanks, man. Well, unless it was about girls. That you can tell me all about; in detail.'
'I saw Setrákus Ra. I talked to him.' Nine pauses, then keeps walking. 'He offered me a deal.'
'Oh, yeah? What kind of deal?'
'If I go back to him and face him, he said he'll let everyone else live, including Sam.'
Nine snorts. 'That's a load of crap. Mogadorians don't make deals. At least, they don't make deals with any intention of keeping up their end of
the bargain. And they don't show mercy.'
'I figure, why not just pretend I'm taking him up on it? I have to go back to the cave anyway to get Sam out.'
Nine turns to me, his face a mask of disinterest. 'Hate to break it to you, dude, but Sam's probably dead. The Mogs don't care about us, and they
don't care about humans. I think you had a bad dream, and I'm sorry you got all scared and felt the need to bore me with it. But even if you did
channel Setrákus Ra, that kind of offer is obviously a trap and you'll die walking into it. In fact, you'll die going within ten miles of that place. I
guarantee it.' He spins around and walks away from me.
'Sam's not dead!' I say, anger welling up inside of me, giving me a strength I haven't felt in days. 'And the dream was real. Setrákus Ra was
torturing him! I watched his skin sizzle from boiling liquid dropping onto it! I'm not going to just sit around here and let it continue to happen.'
He laughs again, but this time it isn't with a sneer. Not exactly reassuring, but definitely more gentle. 'Listen, Four. You're too weak to even run in
place, never mind fight the most powerful being in the galaxy. I know it sounds heartless, dude, but Sam is human. There's no way you can save
them all, so stop wasting your time and energy. It's not like you have an unlimited supply of either.'
The Lumen in my palms starts to light up. I'm in control of it now, a definite improvement. I'm hoping the glow is a sign the effects of the blue force
field are wearing off. 'Look. Sam is my best friend, Nine. You need to get that and keep your opinions about my energy to yourself, okay?'
'No, you look,' says Nine. His voice sounds flat. 'This isn't playtime. We're at war, dude: war. And you can't make this about your feelings for
Sam, if it makes everyone else less safe. I will not let you abandon the rest of us to face Setrákus Ra, just for Sam. We're going to wait until you feel
better, whenever the hell that is, and then we're going to meet up with the others and train until we're ready. If you don't like it, then you'll have to fight
me to get out of here. And I'm so ready for a fight, so, really, bring it on. I could use the practice.'
He lifts his hand and aims it at something through the trees. A second later I hear a quick yelp.
'Got it.' Nine smiles, clearly proud of his telekinetic hunting skills. I follow him, refusing to give up.
'Isn't there anyone you would die for? Anyone you'd risk your life to help?'
'I'm risking my life to help Lorien,' Nine says, fixing me with a stare that makes me listen. 'I'll die for Lorien and anyone who's Loric. And if I die,
and that's a big “if,” I plan on doing it with two Mog heads smashed between my palms and another one under my foot. I'm not looking forward to
feeling your symbol burned into my leg just yet, so grow up, stop being so naïve and think about more than yourself already.'
His words hit me hard. I know that Henri would agree with him, but I will not turn my back on Sam again. I don't know if it's Nine's arrogance or the
urgency of the vision I just had or the fresh air and the walking, but my mind seems to be clear and strong for the first time in days.
'Sam saved my ass more than once, and his dad was there to meet our ship when we landed on Earth. His dad may have even died for us, for
Lorien. You owe it to both of them to go back to the cave with me. Today.'
'Not a chance.'
I step towards him and Nine doesn't hesitate. He grabs me and throws me against a tree. I pull myself to my feet and I'm about to swing at him
when we hear twigs cracking behind us. Nine turns towards the noise. I flatten myself against the tree, dimly lighting my palms to be ready to blind
whoever it is with my Lumen. I hope I haven't overestimated how much of my strength is truly back.
Nine looks over at me, and whispers, 'Sorry about you and the tree. Let's go find whoever's tracking us and kill them before they kill us.'
I nod, and we step forward. The noise came from a patch of pines, thick with needles and offering excellent cover. If it were up to me we'd wait
and see who or what we're facing, but not Nine. He's wearing a strange little smile as we move towards the pines, ready to destroy whatever
emerges. The pines rustle again, and one of the lower branches moves. But what we see isn't a Mogadorian cannon or gleaming sword. Instead,
the small black nose of a brown and white beagle emerges.
'Bernie Kosar,' I say, relieved. 'Good to see you, buddy.'
He trots over and I bend down to pet his head. He's the one creature who has been with me since the beginning. Bernie Kosar tells me he's
happy to see me back on my feet.
'He took long enough, right?' Nine says. I'd forgotten Nine had also developed the Legacy to communicate with animals. I know it's immature, but
it bothers me to share that power with him. He's already the biggest and strongest Garde I've ever seen, has the ability to transfer powers to
humans, an antigravity Legacy, super speed and hearing, telekinesis, and whatever else he hasn't told me yet. My Lumen sets me apart from the
rest, but unless I find a source of fire to combine it with, it's practically useless. My ability to talk to animals was something I was looking forward to
developing further, but now I'm sure Nine will find a better use for it before me.
Bernie Kosar must see the disappointment on my face because he asks if I want to go for a walk with him. Alone.
Nine hears him and says, 'Go for it. You're all BK talks about anyway. Whenever he wasn't patrolling the perimeter, he was in the bedroom
looking after you.'
I keep petting his head. 'That was you, huh?'
Bernie Kosar licks my hand.
'My other best friend,' I say. 'I'd die for you, too, BK .'
Nine groans at the display of emotion. I know we're supposed to have each other's back in this massive intergalactic war, but sometimes I wish it
were just BK and me. And Sam. And Sarah. And Six. And Henri. Really, I'd take anyone but Nine.
'I'm going to find whatever it was I killed out there, make sure we have some food for tonight,' Nine says as he walks away. 'You guys go have
your special walk. When you get back, we need to talk about finding the rest of the Garde. Now that you're functioning.'
'And how exactly are we going to find them? The address Six gave us for a meeting point was in Sam's pocket. For all we know, the Mogs have
it and are waiting for Six to show up. That sounds like even more reason to find Sam, if you ask me,' I say pointedly.
Bernie Kosar agrees. It sounds like he wants to look for Sam almost as much as I do.
'We'll talk about it over dinner. I'm thinking possum, maybe a muskrat,' he says, already heading into the woods to find his prey.
Bernie Kosar tells me to follow him and he leads me through the trees and down a tall grassy hill. The land levels out for a few feet before rising
again. We move quickly and the exercise feels amazing now that my strength is returning. Two huge trees lean into each other up ahead. I focus
and push them apart with my mind. As soon as there's a space between them, BK jumps through and I chase after him, remembering our early-
morning runs to school back in Paradise. Life was so much easier then, when my days were spent training with Henri and my free time was spent
with Sarah. It was exciting, finding out what I was capable of, how my powers would help me do what needed to be done. Even when I was
frustrated or scared, there was so much possibility and I could just focus on that. I had no idea how good I had it.
My back is sticky with sweat by the time we reach a small peak. I'm better, but still not one hundred percent. The view is spectacular, a
panoramic scene of the Appalachian Mountains wrapped in fir trees, bathed in the late afternoon light. I can see for miles.
'I gotta say, buddy, this is pretty awesome. Is this what you wanted me to see?' I ask.
Off in the distance, down on the left, he says. Do you see it?
I scan the landscape. 'In that deep valley?'
Beyond it, he says. Do you see that glow?
Squinting, I look past the valley. There's a cluster of thick trees and the faint outline of a rocky riverbed. Then I see it. Through the bottom of the
trees on the far left is a glowing sliver of blue light. It's the force field at the bottom of the Mog's headquarters.
It can't be more than two miles away. Bernie Kosar says we can go back right now if I want. He'll join me inside this time, now that Sam and I
disabled the system that sent gas a deadly to animals through the mountain.
A shiver runs down my body as I stare at the blue light. Sam is in there. And Setrákus Ra. 'What about Nine?'
Bernie Kosar circles my legs twice before sitting at my feet. It's up to you, he says. Nine is strong and fast, but he's also unpredictable.
'Have you taken him up here?' I ask. 'Does he know how close we are?'
Bernie Kosar cocks his head as if to say, yes. I can't believe he knew and didn't tell me. That's enough. I'm done with Nine.
'I'm going back to the house. I'll give Nine the option of coming with us, but whatever he says, it's time for me to face Setrákus.'
5.
We bounce along a pothole-riddled road in a military transport truck. We're on the outskirts of the city and I look around. I see a massive
mountain range looming in the distance, but that doesn't tell me much. Vehicles full of soldiers are in front of us and behind us. My Chest is at my
feet and Six is sitting next to me. That makes me breathe a little easier. After the battle in Spain, the only time I feel even slightly safe is when Six is
near.
I didn't think I would ever miss the Sisters of Santa Teresa, but right now, I'd give anything to be back at the convent. For years, all I thought about
was escaping their rules and punishments, but now that I have escaped, all I want is something familiar, even if it comes in the form of religious
discipline. My Cêpan, Adelina, is dead, murdered by Mogadorians. My best and only friend, Héctor Ricardo, is also dead. The town and convent
are both gone, obliterated by the Mogs. The deaths weigh heavily on me; I was the one Adelina and Héctor were fighting to protect. God, I hope I'm
not a curse. I hate the idea that my in experience and lack of training might hurt anyone else. I don't want to put this mission in India in jeopardy just
by my presence.
Finally Commander Sharma turns around to give us the lay of the land. 'This trip will last a few hours. Please, get comfortable. Help yourself to
water in the cooler behind you. Don't draw attention to yourselves; don't engage with anyone. Not even to smile and nod. We're wanted.'
Crayton nods.
'So what do you think about all this?' Six asks Crayton.
'You think he's really up there?'
'I do. It makes sense.'
'Why's that?' I ask.
'The mountains are the ideal place for a Garde member to hide. For years, people have been scared to go near the glaciers north of China.
Stories of alien sightings are enough to frighten the locals, and the Chinese military have been unable to investigate the reports because a
mysterious lake appeared in the valley and blocked their access. Who knows what's true, and what's a rumor, but either way it's an excellent place
to hide.'
'Do you think there are other aliens up there beside Number Eight?' says Ella. 'You know, like, Mogadorians?'
I was wondering the same thing.
'I don't know who else is up there, if anyone, but we'll find out soon enough,' says Crayton. He wipes sweat from his brow and touches my Chest
with the tip of his finger. 'In the meantime, we should start learning how to use what's in here to help prepare us, if Marina is kind enough to share.'
'Sure,' I say quietly, lowering my eyes to the Chest. I'm not opposed to sharing my Inheritance, but I'm embarrassed by how little I understand
what I have. My Chest was supposed to be shared between me and Adelina. It was her job to explain how to use everything, how it could save my
life. But that never happened. After a beat, I say, 'I don't know what any of it does, though.'
Crayton reaches forward and touches my hand. I meet his solemn, yet encouraging eyes. 'It's okay that you don't know. I'll show you whatever I
can,' Crayton says. 'I'm not just Ella's Cêpan now; I'm all of yours. As long as I'm alive, Marina, you can count on me.'
I nod, and place my palm against the lock. Now that Adelina is dead, I can open my Chest on my own and it's a bittersweet power. Six watches
me, and I know she understands exactly how I'm feeling, having also lost her Cêpan. The cold metal lock shakes against my skin. With a click, it
falls to the floor of the truck. The dirt road we're driving on is covered with potholes and debris, constantly jostling me and making it hard for me to
steady my hand as I reach inside the Chest. I'm careful not to touch the glowing red crystal in the corner that caused me so much trouble in the
orphanage's belfry, the one I worried was a Loric grenade, or worse. I reach for a pair of dark glasses.
'Do you know what these are for?' I ask Crayton. He examines them for a second but hands them back to me, shaking his head.
'I don't know for sure, but they may give you the power to see through things, like X-ray vision. Or they could be thermal detectors, good for
seeing at night. There's only one way to find out, you know.'
I place the glasses on my face and look out the window. Aside from dulling the brightness of the sun, nothing else seems to happen. I check my
hands but they're just as solid as before, and when I look up at Crayton's face, there aren't any thermal hot spots.
'So?' asks Six. 'What do they do?'
'I don't know,' I say, checking the barren landscape out the window again. 'Maybe they're just ordinary sunglasses.'
'I doubt it,' Crayton says. 'They have a use that you will discover, just like everything else in there.'
'Can I see them?' Ella asks. I hand them over.
She slides the glasses up her nose, then twists around and looks out the back window.
I turn back to my Chest.
'Wait – everything looks a little different somehow but I can't figure out why. It's almost like seeing everything a little delayed . . . or maybe sped
up . . . I can't decide.' Suddenly Ella gasps, then shouts, 'Rocket! Rocket!'
We follow her line of vision, but I don't see anything but crystal-blue sky.
'Where?' Crayton yells. Ella points up at the sky. 'Get out of the truck! We have to get out right now!'
'There's nothing there.' Six squints into the horizon. 'Ella, I think those glasses are messing with you, because I don't see anything.'
Ella doesn't listen. She scrambles over me with the glasses still on and opens the door. The shoulder of the road is lined with sharp rocks and
dead shrubs. 'Jump! Now!'
Finally we hear it, a faint whistling in the air, and a black speck suddenly comes into view, right where Ella was pointing.
'Get out!' Crayton yells.
I grab my open Chest, and jump. My feet hit the hard dirt road and sweep underneath me, and the world instantly becomes a swirl of browns and
blues and sharp pains. The back tire of our truck grazes my arm, and I barely change direction in time to roll out of the way of the next speeding
truck. My head hits a sharp stone and I flip over one last time, landing on my Chest. The impact knocks the wind out of me, and the contents of my
Chest have scattered in the dirt. I hear Ella and Six coughing somewhere nearby but I can't see them in the haze of dust that surrounds us. A
second later the rocket smashes into the ground just behind the speeding truck we dove from. The explosion is deafening, and with Commander
Sharma still inside, the truck flips forward onto its roof in a cloud of smoke. The careening jeep behind it is unable to swerve. It hits the edge of the
chasm caused by the rocket, and dives right into the tremendous hole. Two more rockets hit the convoy. The air is so thick with dust that we cannot
see the helicopters overhead, but we can hear them.
I blindly grope the area around me, trying to gather everything that spilled out of my Chest. I know I'm probably collecting just as many stones and
twigs as pieces of my Inheritance, but I can sort through it later.
I've just grabbed the red crystal when I hear the sound of gunfire tear through the air. 'Six! You okay?' I shout. Then I hear Ella scream.
6.
I'm frantic, pulling open closet doors, looking under what little furniture there is, when I hear someone come noisily into the house. I assume it's
Nine because Bernie isn't growling.
'Nine,' I yell. 'Where'd you hide my Chest?'
'Look under the kitchen sink,' he calls back.
I walk into the kitchen. The curling linoleum floor looks like a decrepit chessboard someone's spilled coffee all over. The handles to the cupboard
under the sink are loose, and when I pull on them I hear a click.
'Wait, Four!' Nine yells from the other room. 'I made a –' The cupboard doors blow open and I fly backwards. 'Trap!' Nine finishes.
A dozen sharpened sticks are shooting straight at me.
They're inches away when my instincts kick in and I'm able to deflect them with my telekinesis. The sticks ricochet left and right, stabbing the
walls.
Nine stands in the doorway laughing. 'So sorry, dude. I totally forgot to tell you I rigged that up.'
Furious, I jump to my feet. Bernie Kosar skids in and growls at Nine. While he berates Nine for his stupidity, I focus on pulling the sticks out of the
walls. I will them to hover in the air, aimed at Nine. 'You don't sound sorry.'
I'm seriously considering launching the little spears at him when he uses telekinesis to break the sticks into two, four and then eight pieces and
they fall to the floor.
'Hey, I really did forget,' he says, shrugging. He turns around to head into the other room. 'Anyway, grab your Chest and get in here. We have to
jet, so start pulling your stuff together.'
My Lumen lights up the moldy cupboard and I carefully stick my head under the sink. At first I don't see anything and think Nine is messing with
me. I'm about to march into the living room to demand he return my Chest to me when I notice something. The left side of the cupboard goes
deeper than the right. I feel my way around and pull away the false plywood wall. Jackpot. There it is. I grab the Chest and carry it out of the kitchen.
In the living room Nine's digging in his own Chest, the Chest we rescued from the Mog cave. 'Good to see you, old friend,' he says when he pulls
out a short silver staff. Next he grabs a round yellow thing covered with small bumps. It looks like a strange fruit and I half expect him to squeeze it to
produce juice. He sets it in his palm, and before I can ask what it is, he whips it down at the floor and quickly backs himself up against the wall. It
bounces high after hitting the carpet and changes from yellow to black, expanding to the size of a grapefruit. When it reaches shoulder height the
small bumps explode, turning into razor-sharp spikes. I duck and roll in BK 's direction to avoid getting impaled.
'What the hell?' I shout. 'You could have warned me! This is the second time in less than five minutes that you've almost killed me.'
Nine doesn't flinch when the spikes retract violently back into the ball just before it returns to his palm.
'Hey, hey, hey, would you please relax?' Nine says. He holds the ball close to his eye, causing me to hold my breath. 'I knew nothing would hit you.
I can control it with my mind. Well, I can control it partly. Usually.'
'Partly? Are you kidding me? I didn't see a lot of control just now. I had to jump out of the way.'
Nine takes the ball away from his eye, looking a little chagrined. Not enough, though. 'Right now, I can only control the color.'
'That's it?' I'm incredulous. He shrugs.
BK tells him to stop fooling around.
'Hey, I'm just checking to make sure I remember how everything works. Everything I know how to use, at least,' Nine says, dropping the ball back
into the Chest. 'Because you never know.' He pulls out the strand of green stones he used back at the Mog cave and flings it into the air. It hovers in
a perfect circle and sucks debris off the ground like a black hole. It spins towards a back window and glows white, and when Nine snaps his fingers
the debris explodes out of the circle, breaking whatever was left of the window.
'Check that one off,' he laughs.
I open my own Chest. Nine thinks that there's something in our Chests that can help us find the others. The first thing I see is the blue coffee can
holding Henri's ashes and I suck in my breath. I'm instantly transported back to the forest in Paradise, walking with Sarah through the melting snow
to see Henri's dead body. I promised Henri I would take him back to Lorien, and I still plan on it.
I carefully move the coffee can to the floor next to the Chest and grab the dagger with the diamond blade, letting the handle extend and wrap itself
around my fist. I turn it over, looking at the blade. I release the dagger and continue to sift through the items. I try not to dwell on the objects I don't
know – the star-shaped talisman, the collection of brittle leaves tied with twine, the bright red oval bracelet – and I stay away from the crystal that's
double-wrapped in towels and stuffed into a plastic bag. The last time I touched that crystal, my stomach convulsed and acid climbed up my throat.
I push aside the smooth yellow Xitharis rock that transfers Legacies and pick up an oblong crystal that is full of memories. Its surface is waxy with
a cloudy inside, and it's the first thing Henri ever pulled out of the Chest to show me. When the cloud swirled, it meant my first Legacy was
developing. This crystal was the beginning.
Then I see Sam's dad's glasses and the white tablet Six and I found in Malcolm Goode's office in the well. That's enough to snap me back to
reality.
I look over at Nine. 'Maybe something in our Chests can get us through the blue force field. I think the effect of it is weakened, anyway. There may
be a chance we can get to Sam tonight.'
'Would be nice if something in the Chest would help us do that, that's for sure,' Nine says in a casual tone, his eyes focused on the purple pebble
he is balancing on the back of his hand. It disappears.
'What's that?' I ask.
He turns over his hand and the pebble reappears on his palm. 'I have no idea, but it would be a killer conversation starter with the ladies, don't
you think?'
I shake my head and slide the red bracelet from my Chest over my hand. I hope it will propel me into the air or shoot a ring of lasers, but it just
hangs there on my wrist. I wave my arm over my head, asking it to work, begging it to reveal its powers. Nothing happens.
'Maybe you should try licking it?' Nine laughs, watching me.
'I'll try anything,' I mutter, frustrated. I keep it on and hope something will just happen. Everything in my Chest came from the Elders. Everything
has a purpose, so I know it must do something. My hand brushes against the velvet bag holding the seven orbs that make up Lorien's solar system.
I pull open the bag and drop the stones into my hand and show them to Nine, remembering the day that Henri first showed them to me. 'Are these
what you're looking for to find the others? Henri had these. This is how we figured out another member of the Garde was in Spain.'
'I've never seen those before. What do they do?'
I blow softly on the stones and they glow, coming to life. Bernie Kosar barks at the sight of the orbs hovering over my palm. They have become
planets and orbit the sun. Just as I'm about to shine my Lumen onto Lorien to see it in its lush, green state as it was the day before the Mogadorian
attack, the orbs once again speed up and brighten and I can no longer control them.
Nine comes closer and we watch as the planets collide one by one with the sun until there is just a large single ball in front of us. The new globe
rotates on its axis and flashes a light so bright we have to shield our eyes. Eventually, the globe dims and sections of its surface rise and recede
until we're looking at a perfect replica of Earth.
Nine is mesmerized. The Earth rotates and we immediately see two pinpricks of pulsing light one on top of the other. Once we can orient
ourselves, we see they are in West Virginia.
'There we are,' I say.
The ball continues to rotate and we see there's another pulse of light in India; a fourth is moving north quickly from what looks like Brazil.
'When I was showing Six and Sam our solar system a few days ago in the car, the same thing happened. It turned into a globe of the Earth. It was
the first time it ever did that,' I say.
'I'm confused,' Nine says. 'There are only four dots on this thing and there are supposed to be six of us left.'
'Yeah, I'm not sure about that. When this happened before, a dot showed up in Spain,' I say. 'Then the globe went all fuzzy and we heard
someone who sounded panicked yelling the name Adelina. We assumed she was another member of the Garde. That's when Six decided to go to
Spain, to try to find her. I figured this was how you planned to contact the others, but I guess not if you've never seen it before.'
Nine's eyes go wide. 'Wait. Oh my God, man. I haven't seen this thing before, but I think Sandor told me about it. To be honest, when we opened
my Chest the first time, the silver staff and the yellow porcupine ball were so amazing I only half listened to anything he said after. But now I
remember, he told me some of us had a red crystal – which I do, and that's what I thought I'd use to communicate with the others – and some of us
have the solar system.'
'I don't get it.'
He turns to his Chest, grabs a glowing red crystal the size of a cigarette lighter, slams the lid of his Chest, and turns back to me. I glance at the
solar system and gasp. One of the blue dots in West Virginia has disappeared.
'Whoa, hold on. Open up your Chest again. I want to see something.'
Nine obeys and a second blue dot reappears on the globe in West Virginia.
'Okay. Now, close it.'
He closes it and the dot disappears again. 'This is boring,' he says. When Nine speaks, the Earth globe grows fuzzy and vibrates with a half-
second delay of his voice. 'Wait, what was that? Why is my voice echoing?' The Earth vibrates again.
'This is not boring. This is incredible,' I say, staring at the globe. 'The reason we don't see all six of the Garde members on the globe is because
the orb only reveals the members of the Garde who have their Chests open at that exact moment. Watch.' I lift the lid of Nine's Chest.
Nine whistles. 'Very cool, Four, very cool.' Half a second later we hear his voice through the globe again. Nine puts his crystal down, having
figured it out.
'But judging by the speed of this guy here,' I say, pointing to the dot in motion, 'whoever is in South America has to be on a plane. It's covering too
much ground too fast to be doing anything else.'
'Why would they have their Chest open on a plane?' Nine asks. 'That's stupid.'
'Maybe they're in trouble. Maybe they're hiding in the bathroom trying to figure out what all this stuff actually does, just like we are.'
'Can they see us right now, too?'
'I don't know, but maybe they can hear us. I think if you hold on to that red crystal, any of us with this macrocosm Earth can hear you.'
'If half of us have a crystal, and the other half have the power to get this big glowing globe up and running, then –'
'The only way for us to actually communicate back and forth would be if a couple of us teamed up first,' I interrupt.
'Well, now that we're together, maybe we should try to talk to the others. You know, in case their macrocosms are going,' I say. 'Maybe another
pair has gotten together like us.'
Nine grabs the red crystal and holds it near his mouth like a microphone. 'Hello? Testing one, two, three.' He clears his throat. 'Okay, if any of you
Garde members are out there standing in front of a glowing ball, listen up. Four and Nine are together and we're ready to meet up with you. We
want to train and end all this bullshit and get back to Lorien. Pronto. We're not going to say exactly where we are in case any Mogs are listening in,
but if you have your macrocosm going you'll see two dots together, and they are, uh, us. So, um . . .' Nine looks at me and shrugs his shoulders.
'That is all. Over and out and stuff.'
The skin on my wrist suddenly feels numb under the bracelet. I shake it and my arm begins to tingle. 'Wait. Say we're about to get out of here and
for them to make their way to the United States. That's where Setrákus Ra, the Mogadorian leader, is. Tell them we're going after him and we're
going to rescue our friends as soon as we can.'
The Earth in front of me buzzes to life with Nine's echoing voice. 'Everyone come to America ASAP . Setrákus Ra has shown his ugly face over
here and we're aiming to smash it in and take him down real soon. We'll send out another message tomorrow. Stay tuned.'
Nine drops the red crystal back into his Chest, looking way too pleased with himself, then kind of embarrassed that he just talked into a ball. I
frown. My right arm has gone ice cold, and I'm about to rip off this bracelet before putting the orbs back into the velvet bag when the Earth grows
fuzzy again. Then there's the sound of an explosion, followed by a voice I know well. It's the same girl I heard before, the girl Six went to Spain to
seek out. She's yelling. 'Six! You okay?'
We hear a scream and two more explosions rock the fuzzy edges of the globe. I grab Nine's crystal out of his chest, frantic to try to communicate
with her.
'Six!' I yell. I would jump into the thing if I could figure out how. 'It's me, John! Can you hear me?'
There's no response. We hear the faint sounds of the blades of a helicopter before the globe goes silent again and the Earth's edges grow solid.
The pulsing light in India is now gone. Suddenly, the globe shrinks and reforms into the seven orbs, each of which falls to the ground.
'That did not sound good,' Nine says, scooping up the stones. He drops them back into my Chest, and take his crystal out of my frozen hand.
Six is in trouble – the kind of trouble that involves explosions and helicopters and mountains. And all of this is happening now, halfway around the
world. How am I going to get to India? Where can I get on a plane?
'Six is the chick who gave you the map to the mountain? The one who abandoned you and your boy to jet off to Spain?' Nine asks.
'That's her,' I say, kicking my Chest shut, fists clenched tight. My head is swimming. What's wrong with Six? Who is the other girl, the one I've now
heard twice? I notice my arm feels strange. Hearing her voice distracted me so much I forgot about the growing discomfort there. I try to remove the
bracelet from my wrist, and it burns my fingers. 'Something's going on with this thing. I think something may be wrong with it.'
Nine shuts his Chest and reaches over. 'The bracelet?' As soon as he touches it he rips his hand away. 'Damn! It zapped me!'
'Well, what do I do?' I try snapping my arm out, hoping I can fling the bracelet off.
Bernie Kosar trots over to smell the bracelet, but stops midstride and jerks his head up to stare at the front door. His ears rise and the fur on his
back bristles.
Someone's here, he says.
Nine and I look at each other and start to slowly back into the room, away from the door. We'd been so engrossed in everything in our Chests,
and in hearing the voice through the globe, that we'd let our guard down, and weren't paying attention to our surroundings.
Suddenly, the door is blown off its hinges. Smoke bombs fly through the windows sending glass shards everywhere. I want to fight, but the pain
from the bracelet is now so intense I can't move. I fall to my knees.
I see a flash of green light and hear Nine shout out in pain. He falls down next to me. I've seen that green light before. That is the unmistakable
green light of a Mogadorian cannon.
7.
Bullets whistle by, exploding in the dirt all around us. Ella and I take cover behind the wreckage of one of the trucks. The bullets seem to be
coming from everywhere, from every direction, from every angle. Ella's been hit. The air is so thick with dust from all the commotion, I can't even see
her wounds. I gently run my hands over her body until I feel the wet, sticky blood and find a bullet hole in her lower thigh. When I touch it, she cries out
in pain.
I use the most soothing voice I can muster, given the circumstances. 'It's going to be okay. Marina can help you. We just need to find her.' I pick
Ella up and start carefully moving away from the truck, shielding her with my body. I almost trip over Marina and Crayton, who are huddled behind
another piece of debris.
'Come on! Ella's hurt! We have to get out of here!'
'There are too many of them. If we try to run now, they'll kill us. Let's treat Ella first, then fight back,' Crayton says.
I set Ella down next to Marina. She's still wearing the dark glasses. I can see her wound clearly now; her blood is flowing steadily. Marina places
her hands on Ella's leg and closes her eyes. Ella inhales sharply, her chest beginning to rise and fall at a rapid pace. It really is amazing to see
Marina's Legacy in action. Another explosion sounds nearby and a blast of dust sweeps over us just as Ella's wound contracts, pushing the bullet
out of her flesh. The gash turns from black and red back to the color of her pearly-white skin. An outline of a small bone shifts just below the surface
of her skin and Ella's body slowly begins to relax. I rest my hand on Marina's shoulder, relieved, and say, 'That was incredible, Marina.'
'Thanks. It was pretty cool, wasn't it?' Marina removes her hands from Ella, who slowly props herself up onto her elbows. Crayton gives her a hug.
A helicopter roars overhead and decimates two trucks with a spray of bullets. A chunk of metal lands close to me; it's a piece of smoldering truck
door, the red number eight just barely visible. The sight of it fills me with anger. Now that Ella is healed, I'm ready to fight back.
'Now we move on them!' I yell at Crayton.
'Is it the Mogadorians?' Marina asks, clicking the lock of her Chest shut.
Crayton looks over the top of the debris heap we've been hiding behind, and ducks back down to report. 'It's not the Mogs. But there are a lot of
them and they're coming closer. We can fight here, but it would be better to take it to the mountains. Whoever they are, if they aren't here to attack
us but are battling Commander Sharma, I see no reason to reveal your powers.'
An explosion behind us pushes another cloud of dirt our way, and I watch the helicopter circle back around and head straight for us. Marina and I
look at each other and we can tell we're both thinking the same thing. There's no way to honor Crayton's request that we not use our Legacies and
do what we need to do. She takes control of the helicopter and reverses its flight path. Its passengers will never understand what happened but we
know it's out of our way. And regardless of who's inside, we don't want anyone to be in danger's path unnecessarily. Ella and I cheer with relief as
we watch the spinning blades disappear into the distance while Crayton watches with a frown. Then Commander Sharma dives behind our cover.
'Thank God, you're alive,' he says. I'm tempted to say the same thing to him. I thought he was killed when that first rocket struck. Blood trickles
from a large cut on his temple, and his right arm hangs awkwardly at his side.
'I'm holding you responsible for this,' I say, glaring at him.
He shakes his head. 'Those are soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Front. They are who we were trying to avoid.'
'What do they want?' I ask.
Commander Sharma scans the horizon before looking me in the eyes. 'To kill Vishnu. And destroy all of his friends. Like you. More are on their
way.'
I move to a crouching stance and carefully peer over the demolished truck. A large brigade of heavily armed vehicles is moving towards us,
several helicopters hovering above them. Tiny flashes of light appear from the long line of the trucks and jeeps, and seconds later I hear the bullets
zip past us.
'Let's go kick some ass,' I say.
'It's not possible to defeat them here,' Commander Sharma says, picking up a machine gun with his good hand. 'No more than twenty of my men
are still fighting. We must take it to higher ground if we want a chance to survive this.'
'Just let me handle it,' I say.
'Wait, Six,' Crayton says, scooping up Marina's Chest. 'He's right. The mountains will give us more cover. You can still take out every single one
of them. It just won't be as visible, which is good for us. We don't need the Mogs picking up on this right now.'
Marina puts her hand on my arm. 'Crayton's right. We need to be smart. Let's not draw more attention to ourselves than we have to.'
'The Mogs?' Commander Sharma asks, confused. We'll need to be more careful around him.
Before anyone can answer, two low-flying helicopters zip in with their guns blazing. Several of the commander's soldiers are mowed down, their
weapons blown to useless shards of metal. If we're going to run, it's now or never. I use my telekinesis to pull on the tail of one of the helicopters,
tipping the nose down. It looks like a rodeo horse trying to buck its rider as the pilot struggles furiously to level the copter out. We watch the pilot
give a particularly hard yank to the joystick and two men bounce right out of the cabin. They weren't very high in the air, so the fall shouldn't injure
them – much.
I look over at our fleet of stalled SUV s and see smoke rising faintly from one of the tailpipes. An engine is still running! I shout, 'Let's go! Now!'
Everyone rushes from behind the cover; Commander Sharma yells for his few remaining men to retreat. The brigade is less than a hundred yards
away. As we run I feel a bullet zip through my hair. Another one rips through my forearm, but before I can scream, Marina is right next to me, her icy
hands tending to my injury as we run. All but one of the commander's soldiers follows his orders to retreat. That lone soldier follows the commander,
running with us.
We reach the SUV and get inside – the four of us, plus Commander Sharma and the one soldier. Crayton steps on the gas and whips us onto the
road. Bullets tear through the tail end of our truck, shattering the back windshield, but we're able to maneuver around a small rock formation and
evade the relentless gunfire.
This is not a road built for speed. It's full of potholes, rocks and other debris, and Crayton struggles to keep us from careening off the shoulder.
The SUV is overflowing with guns--I find a shotgun and crawl into the back, waiting for a target. Marina follows suit, leaving her Chest with Ella.
Now that I have a moment to gather my thoughts, I'm angry. We thought if Number Eight remained in the mountains, we would be safe here, under
the radar. Instead, we're being attacked because of him. If we survive this, I am so going to tear Eight a new one.
'Where are we going?' Crayton yells over his shoulder.
'Just stay on this road,' the commander says. I look over my shoulder and see the Himalayan Mountains through the windshield. They are slowly
getting closer, their jagged tops growing more menacing. Up ahead, the brown desert ends, and a curving band of green surrounds the base of the
mountains.
'Why do these guys want to kill Number Eight?' I ask Commander Sharma, the barrel of my shotgun bouncing off the frame of the back window.
'The Lord's Resistance Front does not believe he is Vishnu. They believe we are blasphemous, accepting this mountain boy as the Supreme
God. They want to kill us in his name.'
'Six!' Ella yells. 'Incoming!' She's still wearing the glasses.
I look out the back window in time to see something fire out of the helicopter. It's a missile of some sort heading straight for us. I use my
telekinesis and send it directly into the desert floor, where it explodes. The helicopter fires two more missiles.
'Time to take these dudes out!' I yell. 'Let's do this one together, Marina.' She nods and instead of directing the rockets into the ground this time,
we loop them so they're heading directly back at the copter. We watch grimly as the helicopter explodes in a giant fireball. We never try to kill; but,
given a choice between killing versus being killed, I will pick us every time.
'Awesome work, Six,' says Ella.
'Yippee-ki-yay, and all that,' I reply with a grim smile.
'Do you think they'll leave us alone now?' asks Marina.
'I don't think it's going to be that easy,' says Commander Sharma.
'She has all the same type of powers as the boy you call Vishnu,' says Crayton, motioning towards me. 'Will that be enough to dissuade them?
Do you think they'd still try to fight him?'
'They would if they could find him,' says the commander.
'How many are there in the Lord's Resistance Front?' I ask Commander Sharma.
'In total? Thousands. And they have wealthy donors who support them in any way they need.'
'Hence the helicopters,' Crayton says.
'They have worse than that,' the commander adds.
'The best plan for us is to outrun them,' Crayton says to the commander. 'I'll drive as fast as I can. If we have to fight, we'll fight; but I'd like to avoid
it.'
Five minutes pass in tense silence. Marina and I monitor the brigade in the distance, and whenever we pass something large enough, we use our
telekinesis to drop it in the path behind us. The tall trees that have begun to dot the sides of the road quickly form a thick line of defense. The car
dips into an extremely narrow valley before beginning to ascend the mountain. We have just come to the base when Commander Sharma tells
Crayton to stop. I lean forward in my seat and see dozens of small mounds in the dirt.
'Land mines?' I ask.
'I'm not sure,' the commander says. 'But they weren't there two days ago.'
'Is there another route to wherever we're going?' Crayton asks.
'No, this is the only path,' Commander Sharma says.
Suddenly, we hear the sound of helicopter blades, but I don't see them yet. They're hidden behind the tall trees. Of course, that means they can't
see us, either, though it sounds like they aren't very far off anymore.
'We're sitting ducks if we stay here,' I say, my mind racing to figure out our next best move.
Crayton opens his door and steps out with a machine gun under his arm. 'Okay, this is it.' He points up and to our right. 'We either go up there
and get behind a line of trees and fight, or we keep running straight up the mountain.'
I follow him out. 'I'm not running.'
'Neither am I,' says Marina, standing next to me.
'Then we fight,' says Commander Sharma. He points into the hills. 'Half of us set up on the left while the other half takes position on the right. I will
take these two with me.' He indicates Ella and me.
Crayton and I look at each other and nod.
Ella turns to Crayton. 'You okay without me, Papa?'
Crayton smiles. 'Marina's legacy will make sure whatever they do to me won't last long. I think I'll be okay.'
'I'll keep an eye on him, Ella,' Marina adds.
'Are you sure we should do this, Commander?' the soldier asks. 'I can go to fetch Vishnu, bring him back to help.'
'No, Lord Vishnu should stay where he's safe.'
Crayton turns to Ella. 'Keep those glasses on. Maybe you can be our eyes up there in the trees. I'm still not sure how they work, but let's hope
they'll help now.'
I hug Marina and whisper into her ear. 'Be confident in your abilities.'
'I should heal Commander Sharma before you go,' she says.
'No,' I whisper. 'I don't trust him yet and he's less dangerous to us if he's injured.'
'You sure?'
'For now.'
Marina nods. Crayton taps her arm and beckons her to join him and the young soldier. The three of them scramble up the left wall of the valley,
disappearing behind a boulder.
Commander Sharma, Ella, and I move up the right side of the hills, carefully avoiding the bumps on the ground as we move. We find a position
behind some massive boulders, and settle in to wait for the brigade to arrive.
I turn to Commander Sharma. I feel slightly guilty about not letting Marina heal him, but for all I know, he's set this up as an elaborate trap. 'How's
your arm?' I whisper to him.
With a grunt, Commander Sharma lies down and sets the barrel of his gun on a flat rock. He looks up and winks. 'I only need the one.'
Out of the corner of my eye I can see a helicopter buzz overhead but it leaves almost immediately. Either Marina took care of it, or the pilot
couldn't penetrate the thick canopy of the valley. I look through the trees, hoping to manipulate the clouds surrounding the peaks of the mountains,
but the afternoon sun has burned them off. With no wind, and no clouds, there aren't any elements to control. I can turn invisible if I need to, but I
prefer to keep that hidden from the commander for now.
'What do you see?' Ella asks.
'A whole lot of nothing,' I whisper. 'Commander, how far away is Number Eight?'
'You mean Vishnu? Not far. A half day's walk, maybe.'
I'm about to ask him to tell me where, exactly. We should know in case something happens to the commander and we need to move forward
without him. But I'm distracted when a rusty pickup truck swings into the narrow valley at full speed with a man standing in the open bed. Even from
a distance, I can see he's nervous as well as armed. He jerks his gun from side to side, frantically trying to be everywhere at once. As soon as our
SUV comes into view, the pickup skids to a stop and the soldier in the back hops out. More vehicles appear and pull up behind the pickup. A
soldier drops out of a red van and sets a rocket launcher onto his shoulder. I see an opportunity.
I nudge the commander with my foot. 'I'll be right back.'
I don't give him a chance to argue as I run quickly into the woods. When he can't see me any longer, I use my invisibility Legacy to disappear and
sprint down into the valley. The soldier has our truck in his crosshairs, but before he can pull the trigger I rip the rocket launcher off his shoulder and
slam one end into his belly. He doubles over and goes down with a scream. Hearing the commotion, the driver of the truck rushes over with a pistol
in his hand. I point the rocket launcher at his face. The soldier takes a split second to decide if the freefloating launcher is about to do its thing, then
turns and runs away with his arms above his head.
I aim at the now empty, rusty pickup and pull the trigger. The rocket flies out of my launcher and a wave of fire explodes under the pickup, blowing
it thirty feet into the air. The burning truck lands hard, and bounces and rolls quickly forward, the momentum sending it into the back of our SUV with
a crash. I watch it lurch forward, rolling slowly over the small mounds in the road that had stopped us from advancing. The next thirty seconds are
filled with ear-splitting, rapid detonations, as soldiers fire blindly around them and the mounds in the road explode. Thousands of birds burst out
from the trees all around us, their sounds quickly drowned out by the snap, crackle and pop of munitions doing their thing. I was right; they were land
mines. And now our SUV is nothing more than a smoldering pile of metal.
Evidently, this was just the opening act. The testing.testing.main attraction – armored vehicles, small tanks, mobile missile units – is closing in on the mountain.
There have to be a couple thousand soldiers on foot. Five or six attack helicopters hover overhead. I hear a whirring and turn to see a missile
launcher rising and rotating, going into operational mode. The tips of five white missiles turn up and towards the area where Marina and Crayton
have taken cover. There's movement in the tree line, and the commander's young soldier runs down into the valley. He's unarmed and headed right
for the missile launcher. At first I think he's going to sacrifice himself somehow to save my friends, but no one fires at him. He stops when he
reaches the launcher and starts pointing higher up the side of the mountain, to where Crayton and Marina are hiding. The launcher rises another few
feet and adjusts its aim.
He's a traitor, part of the group trying to kill us! The next thing I know, he is flying into the air, yanked upward by telekinesis. Marina must have
realized the same thing. But it might be too late. He's already revealed her location.
I look towards the missile launcher and gather my strength so I can alter the flight of the missiles once they're fired. As I start to focus on it,
another launcher whirs to life and aims its missiles directly at me. Though I'm invisible, the army knows a shoulder rocket was fired from where I'm
standing. I only have the power to deal with one of them, and there's no time to run. I have a choice. Save Crayton and Marina or save myself.
The launcher pointed toward the mountain starts firing. The missiles come screaming out, heading straight for the hills. I get control of them and
redirect them into the ground, where they explode, just as the second launcher fires. I turn and see their white tips moving towards me. I don't have
time to do anything, but suddenly the missiles loop up and turn back towards the launcher that fired them and the brigade. They barrel into five
different vehicles, all of which explode.
Marina. She saved my life. We are working together, just as we were meant to do, and the thought makes me feel more determined than before
to get this pit stop over with and find Eight. I want to send a message to the remaining soldiers of the brigade so I stop using my invisibility Legacy
and show myself. I focus and start to control the flames rising from where the missiles exploded with my telekinesis. I spread the fire down the road
to engulf the rest of the brigade. One by one, the flames move down the row of vehicles and it's like exploding dominos. Message received. The
remaining soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Front begin to retreat. For a second, I'm tempted to indulge in a little retribution. But that's cruel and
unnecessary and exactly the kind of thing the Mogadorians would do. I know my fantasies of going medieval on their retreating asses are not going
to help us now.
'That's right! Run! Because if you don't, that fire is just waiting to finish the job off!' When the last one disappears from view, I turn and start
walking back towards the hills. I need to find my friends.
8.
The smoke is thick but beginning to dissipate. From where I am on the floor, I can see dozens of legs and black boots. I raise my eyes and see
almost as many rifles, all of them aimed at my head.
My eyes move from the heavy boots up to the gas masks, relieved to see they belong to humans and not Mogadorians. But what kind of humans
have Mogadorian weapons? A gun barrel is pushed into the back of my skull. Normally, I'd use my telekinesis to rip it away and toss it a mile into
the mountains, but the pain from the bracelet is too intense for me to be able to focus my energy on that. One of the men says something to me, but I
can't concentrate enough to make out what he's saying.
I search for a focal point to help get me through the pain, and see Nine groaning on the carpet. From where I am, it looks as if he's having trouble
breathing; it also looks like he can't move his arms and legs. I want to help him, and struggle to get up, but I'm kicked back down as soon as I start
to move. I roll onto my back and immediately a long cylindrical tube is pressed into my left eye. There are hundreds of lights inside the tube, and I
watch them swirl together to become one solid green beam. It's definitely a Mogadorian cannon, the same kind that paralyzed me outside our
burning house in Florida. I focus my other eye past the side of the weapon and see a man in a khaki trench coat. He pulls back his gas mask to
reveal a ring of white hair and a fat, crooked nose that looks like it's been broken more than once. I find myself looking forward to breaking it again.
'Don't move,' he growls at me, 'or I'll pull the trigger.'
I glance over at Nine, who seems to be recovering. He's sitting up, looking around, struggling to shake off his dazed expression. The man with
the cannon pressed to my face looks over at him. 'What do you think you're doing?' he says.
Nine smiles up at him, clear eyed and calm. 'Trying to decide which one of you I'm going to kill first.'
'Shut him up!' a woman yells as she enters the house, also carrying a Mog cannon. Two men press their boots against Nine's shoulders and
force him back to the floor. The woman motions at me, and someone takes me by the shoulders and pulls me onto my feet. Another man grabs my
wrists to put me in handcuffs.
'Son of a bitch!' he cries as he touches my red bracelet. I may not know what all the bracelet does, but I like this part of it.
Once upright, I get my bearings. There are ten or twelve men in masks, all holding rifles. The man and woman who were speaking seem like
they're in charge. I look for Bernie, but don't see him. Even so, I can hear him inside my head.
Just wait. Let's see what they want and what they know.
'What do you want with us?' I ask the man with the broken nose.
He laughs and looks over at the woman. 'What do we want, Special Agent Walker?'
'For starters, I want to know who your friend is over there,' she says, pointing the tube back at Nine.
'I don't know this kid,' Nine says. He blows his hair out of his face and offers a smile. 'I just stopped by to sell him a vacuum cleaner. The place
looked like a dump and I thought he could use it.'
The man circles over to Nine. 'Is that what you have in these fancy chests here? Vacuum cleaners?' He nods to one of the other officers and says,
'Let's have a look at these vacuum cleaners, shall we? I may be interested in one myself.'
'Be my guest.' Nine's smile is menacing. 'I'm having a sale. Two for the price of three.'
For a split second, Nine and I make eye contact. Then Nine sweeps his eyes over to the wall, where a moth is hovering near the ceiling. Bernie
Kosar. I'm sure Nine also heard BK 's orders to wait to see where this is going. I wonder if he'll be able to control himself. One of the soldiers slaps
a pair of handcuffs on Nine, and he quickly sits up again. I can see the handcuffs around his wrists are already broken. He's only holding his hands
together to keep up the charade.
Nine's just waiting for the right time to attack. I don't know if he ever intended to do as BK asked. I pull my arms apart behind me, quietly and
easily breaking my own handcuffs. Whatever is about to happen, I'd better be ready.
A bunch of the men have surrounded Nine's Chest. One of them is slamming the butt of his rifle over and over on the lock holding it closed, but it
doesn't have any effect. He smashes it a few more times anyway, clearly frustrated.
'How about this.' Special Agent Walker pulls out a revolver. She fires at the lock and the bullet ricochets around the room, barely missing another
officer's leg.
The broken-nose man grabs Nine by the back of his neck, pulls him to his feet, then shoves him forward. Nine can't maintain the ruse of his
handcuffs and braces his fall, landing on his hands and knees. Realizing Nine's hands are now unrestrained, the man yells over his shoulder,
'Somebody get me some more handcuffs! We've got a broken pair over here!'
His chin tucked into his chest, Nine's whole body vibrates with laughter. He pops his legs out and does a pushup. Then he does another one. An
officer kicks his right hand out from underneath him, but Nine doesn't miss a beat. He does another pushup with just his left hand. The officer kicks
at his left hand, but Nine is too fast to let that knock him over. His right hand is down in a flash and his one-handed pushup shows off his perfect
form. Four officers jump on him, each one holding a leg or arm, but Nine just keeps on laughing. Suddenly, I find myself joining him. His bizarre
sense of humor is infectious. Man, I have to give him props.
Special Agent Walker turns to me. I slowly pull my arms out from behind me, the broken handcuffs dangling from my wrists. I wiggle my fingers
and casually place both hands behind my head and start whistling.
She narrows her eyes and arranges her face in the most intimidating glare she has. 'Do you know what happens to kids like you in prison?' she
asks.
'They escape? Like I did last time?' My eyes are wide and innocent.
I hear Nine howling with laugher at my performance from under the pile of officers. I have to admit, Nine does bring a weird kind of fun to the
proceedings. My smile breaks wide now. I know these men are just trying to do their jobs. They think they're keeping their country safe. Right now,
though, I hate them. I hate them for slowing us down and I hate this woman's tough-guy act. I hate that they have Mog cannons. But most of all I hate
them for working with Sarah to capture Sam and me last week. I wonder what they promised her to get her to turn me in. Did they play on her
sympathies? Convince her she would save me, by letting them take us? Did they say she could visit me, while I paid the price for my socalled
mistakes? I look over at Bernie Kosar, but I don't see the moth anymore. That's when a fat brown and white cockroach scurries up my leg and
burrows into my jeans pocket.
Nine will go along with this for a while longer, BK tells me. But I don't know how much longer. Find out everything you can, quickly.
The lead guy claps his hands to get the attention of the other men. 'Okay! Let's get these guys out of here before our friends show up.'
'Who are your friends?' I ask him, though I'm already pretty sure that for some reason the U.S. government and the Mogadorians are working
together. That's the only explanation for why they'd be using Mog weapons against us. 'Who don't you want to show up?'
'Shut up!' Special Agent Walker yells. She pulls out a cell phone and dials a number. 'We're bringing him in, plus another one,' she says into the
phone. 'Two Chests. No, but we'll get them open. See you soon.'
'Who was that?' I ask. She ignores me as she puts her phone away.
'Hey, buddy, I thought you wanted to buy a vacuum,' Nine says to me. 'I really need this sale. My boss is going to kill me if I come home with a full
box of Hoovers again.'
They pull Nine to his feet. He stretches his back and smiles, like a cat smug and full of mouse. 'It doesn't matter where you take us, there's no
prison that can hold us. If you knew who we are, you wouldn't waste your time with this crap.'
Agent Walker laughs. 'We know who you are, and if you were as smart or as tough as you think you are, we would have never found you in the
first place.'
Officers pick up our Chests and walk out the front door. New handcuffs are slapped over our wrists. They use three pairs on Nine.
'You have no idea what we're capable of,' Nine says in a sickeningly sweet voice as they lead us through the front yard. 'If I wanted to, I could kill
you all in a matter of seconds. You're damn lucky I'm being such a good boy. For now.'
9.
We're at a gate. There is a narrow path beyond it and it goes straight up the mountain. Crayton asks me to cover the trail behind us while Six
takes the lead with Commander Sharma. I wonder if his soldier's betrayal has had any effect on him. I wonder if he will question the loyalty of his
troops when he returns to his command. I can't imagine asking him, not without somehow suggesting he should have known. Of course, maybe he
should have.
I'm carrying the small tree branch from my Chest. I need to figure out what it does. The first time I'd held thisZ – the first time I'd ever opened my
Chest, back in Santa Teresa at the convent, when Adelina was still alive – I hadn't had time to figure out what it did. But I did remember that when
I'd held it out the window, I'd felt some kind of magnetic force. Almost instinctively, I rub its smooth, pared surface with my thumb. After a while, I
notice it has an effect on the trees we pass. I aim and concentrate on what I want from the trees, and soon I hear the creaking of their roots and the
clattering of their branches. I turn and walk backwards up the path, asking the trees on the edges to keep us safe, and they bend and twist into each
other, making it impossible for anyone to follow. I want so much to be of help, I want so much not to be a curse, and to put my Inheritance to use to
help us, that every time a tree responds a huge wave of relief washes over me.
We walk mostly in silence. At one point, to break up the boredom of the hike, I tickle Six's face by lowering a branch right in front her. She swats it
away without breaking stride, too completely focused on what may lay ahead. As we walk I think about Six. About how fearless she was back with
the soldiers. She's always so calm, cool and collected. She takes command and makes decisions as if it were the most natural thing for her to do.
One day I'll be like her. I'm sure of it.
I wonder what Adelina would think of Six – and about me now. I wonder how much further along I'd be if she had trained me. I know all those years
in the orphanage without guidance from her means I'm not where I should be. I'm not as strong and confident as Six. I'm not even as knowledgeable
as Ella. I try to bury my resentment and focus on Adelina's final act of honor. She charged at the Mog fearlessly, armed with just a kitchen knife. I try
to stop the memory before I get to the part where she dies. I almost never do. If only I'd had the courage to fight alongside her, or knew then how to
use my telekinesis to unwrap the Mogadorian's hand from Adelina's neck. If I had, she might be walking with us right now.
'We rest here,' the commander says, his voice breaking through my reverie. He points to a couple of flat boulders bathed in the afternoon sun.
Just beyond the rocks I can see a small stream of fresh water. 'Not long, however. We need to make a lot more progress up this mountain before
nightfall.' He looks up at the midafternoon sky.
'Why? What happens at nightfall?' Six asks.
'Very strange things. Things you are not yet ready to see.' Commander Sharma takes off his shoes and socks, rolls up the cuffs of his pants in a
fussy sort of way and wades into the stream.
Crayton removes his shoes and socks too, and follows him. 'You know, Commander, we're already taking a pretty big leap of faith just following
you up this mountain. The least you could do is answer our questions when we have them. We have a very important mission. And we deserve your
respect.'
'I do respect you, sir,' he says. 'But I follow Vishnu's orders.'
Crayton shakes his head in frustration and walks further upstream. I notice Ella has wandered away and is sitting alone on one of the boulders by
the stream. She's been wearing the dark glasses from my Chest the entire hike, and she takes this moment to clean them carefully on her shirt.
Seeing my gaze on her, she holds them out to me. 'I'm sorry, Marina. I don't know why I hung on to them. It's just that –'
'It's okay, Ella. They helped you see that attack before any of us could. We may not know their full power, but you seem to be doing just fine with
them.'
'I guess so. I wonder if there's anything more I can get them to do.'
'What have you seen as we've been walking?' Six asks.
'Trees, trees and more trees,' Ella says. 'I keep waiting for something to happen, or to see something unusual. I wish I knew for sure this meant
there is nothing for me to see.' I can tell she is frustrated with herself, not the glasses.
With the small branch in my hand, I bend a large tree over to create shade on the boulders. 'Well, keep trying.'
Ella holds the dark glasses up to the light. As she turns them over it's almost as though I can read her thoughts, thanking me for making her feel
like she's part of the team, doing some good.
I look over at Six, who has stretched out on the ground. 'What about you, Six?' I ask. 'You want to check out anything in my Chest?'
She stands, yawns and looks up the path. 'I'm okay, I think. Maybe later.'
'Sure,' I say. I walk down to the stream and splash water on my face and on the back of my neck. Just as I'm about to take a drink, Commander
Sharma wades out of the stream and says it's time to go. We all get ready to continue up the mountain. I grab my Chest and balance its weight on
my hip.
Immediately, the trail becomes much steeper. It's also surprisingly slick and absent of rocks, as if this path had been recently washed clear by a
storm. We're all having difficulty keeping our footing. Crayton tries running to gain some momentum, but he slips and falls in the dirt.
'This is impossible,' he says, standing up and brushing himself off. 'We're going to need to cut through the forest to gain any kind of traction.'
'Out of the question,' the commander says, his arms out like a tightrope walker. 'We will not conquer our obstacles by running away from them.
Speed does not matter, just that we do not stop.'
'It doesn't matter how slowly we go? This message brought to you from the guy who says very strange things happen at nightfall,' Six snorts. 'I
think you need to tell us how much further we have to go, and if it's longer than three hours on foot, then I say we enter the forest and forgo these
obstacles,' she says, staring him down.
I look at the small branch in my hand and an idea comes to me. I concentrate on the trees around us, lowering branches in from both sides.
Suddenly we have a way to pull ourselves up wards, rope climbing the Lorien way. 'How about this?' I ask.
Six grabs the line of branches and tests their strength, moving up a few feet. Over her shoulder, she yells, 'Brilliant move, Marina! You rock!'
I continue to bend the trees as we climb. Still wearing the dark glasses, Ella watches the woods around us, occassionally glancing over her
shoulder. Once the path levels out and it's easier to maintain our footing, Six digs in and starts to run up the trail ahead of us, circling back regularly
to report on what she's seen ahead. Every time it's the same: 'It just keeps going.' Finally, she returns to say there's a fork up ahead. Hearing this,
Commander Sharma looks confused and picks up the pace.
When we reach the fork in the dirt path, Commander Sharma frowns. 'This is new.'
'How can it be new?' Crayton asks. 'Both paths look exactly the same. Well traveled and equally so.'
The commander paces in front of the fork. 'I promise you the path on the left did not exist before. We are very close to Vishnu. We go this way.'
He begins to walk confidently up the path to the right and Crayton follows.
'Wait,' Ella says, 'I see nothing up ahead on the right. The glasses are just showing me dark emptiness.'
'That's all I need to hear,' Six says.
'No. We go right,' the commander says to Six. 'I've traveled this many times, my dear.' Six pauses, then slowly turns to look at him.
'Do not call me dear,' Six warns.
As Commander Sharma and Six glare at each other my eyes are drawn to something scratched in the mouth of the path on the left. The figure is
shallow and just a few inches long, and I have to look closely, but there is no question. It's the number eight.
'According to this, Ella's right. We go left,' I say, pointing at the number.
Six walks over to the markings and drags the toe of her shoe under the number eight. 'Good eye, Marina.' Crayton looks at it too, and smiles.
We fall back into our normal positions, with Six and a reluctant Commander Sharma up front and me taking up the rear. The path ascends
slightly, turning rocky. Then, to everyone's surprise, a steady stream of water begins to flow from ahead of us, down the trail. The rocks under our
feet soon become tiny islands. I jump from one rock to another, but in a few minutes the rocks are submerged. All of a sudden, we're walking
through a river.
Ella is the first one to speak. 'Maybe the glasses were wrong? Maybe this path wasn't the right one after all.'
'No. This is correct,' the commander says, bending down to drag the tips of his fingers along the surface of the water. 'This is a sign I've seen
before.' We have no idea what this cryptic comment means but we've gone this far, so we might as well keep going.
The river current becomes faster and it's harder to move against it. We trudge higher up the path until the water is to Ella's waist and I'm having
trouble keeping my balance. But just as quickly as it began, the water slows and the land levels out and opens into a large pool of water. A jagged
wall of stone stands high behind the pool, and four separate waterfalls descend from its top, crashing into the water.
'What's that?' Ella points.
In the middle of the giant pool, a white boulder juts out of the surface. A gleaming blue statue of a crowned man with four arms rests atop the
boulder.
'The Almighty Lord Vishnu,' Commander Sharma whispers.
'Wait. That's supposed to be Eight? A statue?' Six says, turning to Crayton.
'What's he holding?' Ella asks. I follow her gaze and see that there's an object in each of his four hands: a pink flower, a white shell, a gold wand,
and on the tip of one of his index fingers, a small blue disc that looks like a CD.
The commander wades further into the pool. He's smiling and his hands are shaking. He turns to us. 'Vishnu is the Supreme God. In his left
hands, he holds a conch shell to show he has the power to create and maintain the universe, and under that is a mace to signify his power to
destroy materialistic and demoniac tendencies. In his right hands are the chakra, to show he has a purified spiritual mind, below that there is the
beautiful lotus flower.'
'Which shows divine perfection and purity,' Crayton adds.
'Among other things, yes! That is right, Mr. Crayton. Very good.'
I stare at the statue, at its serene blue face and gold crown and the objects in its hands, and I feel myself forgetting about everything else. About
the battle at the base of the mountain and the carnage back in Spain. About Adelina and John Smith and Héctor. I forget about my Chest and
Lorien and the fact that I'm standing in cold water. The energy flowing through me is magnificent. And judging by the peaceful looks on the faces of
the others, the energy is contagious. I find myself closing my eyes and feeling blessed to be here.
'Hey! He's gone!' Ella yells. My eyes snap open to see her whipping off the dark glasses. 'Vishnu's gone!'
She's right – the white boulder in the middle of the lake is empty. I look at Six and Crayton and see they're on high alert, ready for danger. I
glance around us. What is this, a trap?
'He will now test you,' Commander Sharma says, interrupting my thoughts. He's the only one among us who doesn't look shocked by Vishnu's
disappearance. 'That is why I have brought you here.'
We all see it at the same time. Something is blocking the sun on top of the jagged wall above the pool, and a long, oddly shaped shadow is cast
along the water. A figure walks slowly along the ridge until it stands directly above the farthest of the four waterfalls on the left.
'Commander?' I ask. 'Who is that?'
'That is your first test,' the commander says, stepping onto the grassy shore around the lake. We all follow, without taking our eyes off the figure.
A second later it dives gracefully off the cliff. I notice its legs are strangely short and it has a wide, circular torso. It falls slowly, almost floating, as if
it can control gravity. When it breaks the surface of the pool, there is no splash. Not even a ripple. Six reaches up and squeezes the large blue
pendant that hangs around her neck. Ella takes a few steps back, away from the lake.
'This could be a trap,' Crayton says quietly, voicing my fear. 'Prepare to fight.'
Six lets the pendant drop from her hands and rubs her palms together. I set my Chest down and begin to mimick her movements, but I feel
ridiculous and glance around as surreptitiously as I can to see if anyone noticed. Good thing they are otherwise occupied. Fact is, Six knows how to
fight, has trained for this her entire life. Everything she does has a purpose. I'm just rubbing my hands together. I slowly lower my hands back to my
side.
'He'll test you one at a time,' says the commander. Six snorts.
'You don't make the rules. Not for us,' Six says. She turns to Crayton, who nods.
'Commander, this is not what we came here to do,' Crayton adds. 'We came here to find our friend, not to be tested or to fight.'
Commander Sharma ignores him, walks into a patch of short grass and sits. I never would have taken him for a guy who could pretzel himself into
the lotus position. 'It must be one at a time,' he says serenely.
The being – or whatever it is – that dove into the lake is still underwater. And I'm the only one with the Legacy to meet it down there. I know what I
have to do. Still, I'm surprised to hear the words come out of my mouth. 'I'll go first.'
I look over at Six. She nods at me and I dive into the lake. The cool water becomes darker the deeper I swim. My eyes are open, and at first I can
only see a few inches of murky water in front of me. But my eyes soon adjust and my vision penetrates far into the lake, my ability to see in the dark
coming in handy. I allow the water to enter my lungs, and a familiar calm sweeps over me. I start breathing normally, letting my Legacy take over.
I reach the muddy bottom and spin around, looking in every direction for the thing that dove from the cliff. Something moves over my right
shoulder, and I turn to see a figure coming at me. He's wearing a golden crown over his short, jet-black hair. His eyebrows are perfect semicircles,
and his nose is pierced with a gold ring. He is strangely beautiful. I can't take my eyes off of him.
I stand perfectly still, waiting to see what he wants. He comes closer. When he gets within a few feet of me and I can see him more clearly, my jaw
drops. What I thought was a strangely circular torso is, in fact, the body of a turtle. I'm mesmerized, watching to see what he will do next. So much
so, I'm taken by surprise when he lunges towards me and hits me with his two right arms.
I go spiraling backwards, the force propelling me with a speed that stuns me. But I'm not in motion for long. My feet quickly find the muddy bottom
and I twist around in a panic, trying to find him in the darkness, my senses on alert and on guard. Something taps my shoulder and I turn to see the
blue turtle man. Damn, he moves fast. He winks at me, then swings both of his left arms, but this time I'm ready for him. I raise my forearm and knee
in time to block them. Then I plant the bottom of my foot squarely on his chest and kick as hard as I can. I flip over and come at him from the back,
wrapping my arms around his neck, and look around for something, anything, I can use as a weapon. I see a large rock sticking out of the mud in
front of us, and I use my telekinesis to send it at this alien turtle, using all of my strength to pull it through the water. He sees the rock coming and
when it's within inches of hitting him, he just disappears. Poof. The rock smashes me instead and I fall back in the mud.
I lie there dazed, waiting for him to appear again, but he doesn't come. Eventually, I decide to float to the top.
The first thing I see as I break the surface is Six, standing at the edge of the water, looking for me. 'What happened?' she calls.
'She passed.' Commander Sharma nods.
'You okay?' Ella shouts. 'I couldn't see anything through the glasses.'
'I'm good,' I yell back. And I really am.
'What do you mean, she passed?' Crayton demands of the commander. 'That was one of his tests?'
The commander just smiles serenely and ignores Crayton.
'Okay, who's next?' Treading water, my eyes follow the commander's finger high over my head. I turn to see a shadowy figure up on the jagged
wall again. This time he's a giant bearded man with an axe in his hand.
Six wades into the water up to her knees as I climb out, wringing water out of my long, dark hair. She is all steely determination and confidence
when she says, 'Me.'
The figure walks to the third waterfall and dives. This time he makes a massive splash when he hits the pool. We can see the ripple on the
surface of the water as he moves towards Six under water. Then the tip of his axe comes out of the lake, followed by his giant head. Six doesn't
flinch, doesn't change expression at all, even when he's fully emerged and stands at least four feet taller than her in the shallow water at the edge of
the lake.
With a grunt and a howl, the giant swings the axe. Six leaps out of the way but before he can pull back, she kicks at the wooden handle, breaking
it in half.
'Way to go, Six!' Ella yells.
The giant swings a fist at her, which she easily avoids with a bob and a weave. With the next beat, she lands a quick kick to his kneecap. As the
giant bends over and howls in pain, Six grabs the end of the broken ax handle as it floats by and swings it at his head. The being disappears before
it hits him.
'What the hell was that?' Six asks, whipping her head around wildly, on the alert for any kind of reappearance.
Commander Sharma smiles placidly. This guy is really starting to make me angry. 'That was another test, which you passed. There is one more.'
Before anyone can speak, we hear a roar. I reel back with horror at the creature I see emerging from the water. It's over ten feet tall and has the
head of a lion and the body of a man. It has five muscular arms flexed at each of its sides. The creature shakes the water from its mane as it steps
onto the shore and marches towards Ella, unleashing a second roar.
'Oh. My. God,' Ella says, mouth open and eyes wide.
'No,' Crayton says, stepping in front of Ella. 'You're not ready for this – it's too much.'
Ella rests a hand on Crayton's arm. A small smile breaks across Ella's face and she seems to transform from a scared kid into a Garde
prepared to fight. 'It's okay. I can do this.'
Six comes to my side. We're both ready to fight if Ella needs us. The creature moves towards her; she slides my glasses back onto her face.
Then, it attacks.
The creature swings all ten arms at Ella, but she ducks and avoids each one. It's as if Ella sees every punch before it happens. The tree behind
her ends up taking the beating. Large chunks of wood fly around her, hitting the creature's face, bouncing off its chest. Not running away but not
fighting back either, Ella circles the tree trunk, continuing to dodge the ten fists. The tree is getting pummeled.
Suddenly, Ella screams. 'Oh no! What have I done?'
Before I can figure out what Ella means, there's a loud crack and the heavy tree trunk tips forward. It's about to crush the creature when the figure
disappears just like all the others. As the tree continues its fall to the ground, a branch swipes the dark glasses off Ella's face and they are crushed
by a huge tree branch. 'Marina, I'm so sorry! I knew the glasses were going to be broken, but I couldn't do anything to stop it.'
Crayton, Six, and I run over to Ella, who's staring in horror at the fragments of the glasses by her feet. 'Ella! Don't worry about the glasses. You
held your own and that thing disappeared. What's important is that you're okay. I'm so proud of you,' I tell her.
'Ella, that was amazing!' says Six.
'Congratulations,' the commander says, still sitting calmly, Buddha-like. 'You have just defeated three of Vishnu's avatars. You've passed his test.
The first was Kurma, a half man, half tortoise who churned the ancient ocean so that other peaceful gods could regain immortality. The man with the
axe was Parashurama, the first warrior saint. The last was one of the most powerful incarnations of Vishnu, the man-lion, Narismha. Now, we await
Vishnu's arrival.'
'We're done waiting,' says Crayton, turning to the commander, jaw set and fists clenched by his side. 'He better show himself and fast.'
'Chill, chill, chill,' a boy's voice says, emerging from the high grass behind me. 'The commander was just following my orders. I was being
cautious.'
From the grass we now see the statue of Vishnu step towards us, alive and smiling.
'I've been waiting a long time to meet you.'
10.
Sitting on a metal chair, I'm in a Plexiglas cage in the back of a small truck. My hands are cuffed to the chair and my ankles are secured with
heavy shackles. A strap of leather pulls my forehead back against the Plexiglas wall behind me. I'm facing the side of the truck, but can turn my
head just enough to see Nine, also in a Plexiglas cage, a few feet away from mine. In front of me a guard is watching us. I know I could free myself in
an instant, but BK , who's still hiding in my pocket, is right. We need to see what they know and how it could help us. Nine must agree because he is
even more capable of breaking the binds that hold him, but he, too, does nothing. There are a bunch of locks on our cages and the only way we can
talk through the thick Plexiglas is through the eight tiny holes in the cage doors. The truck's engine is running, but we haven't moved an inch.
Special Agent Walker is sitting on a long metal bench near the front of the truck. She has one foot on my Chest, and the other on Nine's. A
Mogadorian cannon lies across her lap. The man with the crooked nose is sitting next to her with the other cannon. Walker is whispering into a cell
phone. Every so often she glances over at us. I can almost hear what she's saying, catching words like boyfriend and powerless. I remember Nine
saying back in the mountain that he can hear for miles. I hope he's picking up more than I am.
'Hey, John!' Nine yells.
The guard turns towards Nine's cage and aims a rifle at Nine's head. 'You! Shut up!'
Nine ignores him. 'Johnny! When do you want to roll on out of here? I don't know about you, but I'm bored, I could use a change of scenery.' He
does enjoy pissing people off. I'm beginning to understand the appeal.
Special Agent Walker closes her phone and pinches the bridge of her nose with her fingers. She looks like an aggravated parent or teacher, her
exhaustion wiping away a lot of her authority. Then she takes a deep breath and sits up straight, as if she's made a decision. She knocks on the
window, indicating the driver should start moving.
She stands and marches towards us, balancing herself with the cannon over her head. She comes to a stop in front of me. There's something in
her eyes that wasn't there before. It's almost as if she's sorry she caught us. Or she's sorry about what she has to do next. Or both.
'How did you find us?' I ask.
'You know how,' she says.
I still have the bracelet around my wrist. It's been quiet for the last few minutes, but as soon as the agent speaks, it begins to buzz again.
Nine shouts, 'Hey, I wasn't kidding about being bored here. I don't feel like playing nice anymore. It's up to you, but you should know that you don't
have long before I decide to amuse myself. You can tell us everything you know right now, or I'll kick my way out of here and make you tell me.
Guess which one will make my day a little more fun?'
The man with the crooked nose rises slowly from the bench and aims his cannon directly at Nine. 'Who do you think you are, kid? You're in no
position to threaten us.'
'Whatever you're planning, I promise, I've been through worse,' Nine says.
'I know exactly where you were before. Don't you get that? We know.' The man sounds annoyed by Nine's bravado.
'Agent Purdy,' Walker says to him. 'Lower your weapon. Now.'
The agent starts to lower it and I decide to have some fun. I guess Nine is rubbing off on me. Using my telekinesis, I rip the cannon out of his
hands and toss it to the back of the truck. It hits the back door before landing on the floor with a clang. Just at that moment we take a sharp corner
and Agent Purdy stumbles towards me, his right shoulder slamming against my cage. I use my telekinesis to keep him pinned in place.
'Son of a . . .'
'Don't you know you should always wear a seat belt, Agent Pretty?' Nine laughs. 'Safety first! Here, take one of mine. You just need to come on in
here to get it.'
Agent Purdy says, 'However you're doing this, you better stop it.' He tries to sound scary, but it's hard to sound threatening in his position.
I lean forward, easily breaking the strap across my forehead. Play time is over. 'Agent Purdy, do you know where Sam Goode is?'
'We have Sam,' Special Agent Walker says, turning towards me. Her voice is casual but her cannon is pointing right at me.
For a second, I'm so blown away by this new piece of information, my mind goes blank, and I accidentally release Agent Purdy. He crashes into
the aisle.
They have Sam? Setrákus Ra isn't torturing him in the cave like I saw in my vision? He's okay? I'm about to ask where Sam is when I notice the
lights swirling in the tube of Special Agent Walker's cannon. Instead of green, these lights are black and red.
She grins at the alarmed look on my face. 'If you're lucky, John Smith, or whatever your name is, we'll show you a video of how we use our
interrogation techniques on Sam. But if you're really lucky, we'll show you some footage of that little blonde girlfriend of yours. What's her name
again?'
'Oooooohhhh, shit,' Nine says. I can hear the grin in his voice as he knows what is about to go down. 'Now you've gone and done it.'
It takes me a second to find my voice. 'Sarah,' I whisper. 'I know she's working with you. What did you have to tell her to turn her against me?'
Agent Purdy grabs his cannon and settles back into his seat. 'Are you kidding me? That girl wouldn't tell us a thing, and, believe me, we asked
many things in many different ways. She had nothing to say to us. She's in love.'
Once again, I'm stunned. I was so sure Sarah was working with the government to bring me in. When I saw her last week in Paradise, she acted
so strange. She met me in the park, but then started getting mysterious text messages – at two in the morning. Seconds later we were surrounded
by agents and being slammed to the ground. I can't think of anything else that explains it. It had to have been those text messages; they must have
been from the police. How else could they have known that Sam and I were there? Damn. Now I don't know what to think. And she's still in love with
me?
'Where is she?' I demand.
'Far, far away,' Special Agent Walker says. Is she taunting me?
'Who cares, dude?' Nine yells, interrupting. 'Big picture, Johnny, big picture! She's not in it! Neither is Sam!'
I ignore him. Now that I know the U.S. government has Sam and Sarah, I'm determined to find them both. I'm thinking of my next move, my next
question, when I feel Bernie Kosar crawling out of my jeans pocket.
It's almost time to go, he says. We'll take the woman to lead us to Sam and Sarah.
'Nine,' I say. 'You ready to get out of here?'
'God, yes. Been ready forever. I really have to pee.'
Special Agent Walker glances from me to Nine and back again. She doesn't know where to point the cannon, so she moves it back and forth
Bernie Kosar jumps from my lap and crawls up the glass door. He flitters his tiny cockroach wings at me and he says to count to five.
'Hey, Nine?' I ask.
'I'm already on three, my man,' he says.
Walker shouts at us to shut up. My bracelet vibrates and sends a thousand pinpricks up and down my wrist but I ignore it. Nine breaks all of his
restraints as if they were nothing, and stands up. I do the same, though it takes more effort for me. Nine kicks the Plexiglas wall at the front of his
cage and the whole thing pops easily out of its frame. As he steps out, the guard fires at him. With a smile he just raises his hand and stops bullets
in midair. He lowers his hand, and the bullets fall to the floor one at a time.
He looks over at me, 'Need some help there, buddy?' He kicks in a wall of my cage, and I step out. BK scrambles back into my pocket.
Before the guard can do anything, I use my telekinesis to launch him to the ceiling and twist his weapon into a useless piece of metal. Agent
Walker and Purdy both fire their Mog cannons at us, but Nine stops the streams that come out of them. He smiles, and shakes his finger at the two
agents. 'No, no, no. You should know better by now.' He looks over at me. 'Get ready, Johnny, 'cause we are going for a spin!'
The truck immediately flies off the road and starts rolling. Without warning, Nine grabs me and links arms, pulling me along until I gain my footing.
We run up the left side of the truck, moving like a hamster in a wheel so we can stay horizontal as the truck flips over and over. Metal crunches
around us, sparks rain from every corner and the guard and agents look like rag dolls as they're tossed in all directions. The force of the crash
causes the back doors to pop open and when the truck stops rolling, we jump out. There were a number of police vehicles trailing us and they've all
come to a screeching halt with their sirens blaring.
'Hey, John?' Nine says, unfazed by any of it.
'Yeah?' I say, shaking my head as I try to lose the dizzy feeling from the spinning truck. Neither of us is taking our eyes off the blinking crowd of
police cars.
He starts to step back towards the truck and I do the same. 'We gotta get our Chests back, dude, and do what BK said and get that woman
agent.'
'Definitely.' I pat my pocket, making sure BK is still there.
'So why don't you take care of that, while I take care of this.' Nine telekinetically lifts two police cruisers off the ground, and the officers inside
struggle to get out.
I dash back to the truck, now smoldering in the ditch. I jump inside, avoiding the guard and Agent Purdy, moaning on the floor, and find our
Chests. Special Agent Walker sits against what remains of the metal bench, staring at the blood on her hands in a daze. Her red hair falls loosely
down her shoulders, and there's a long scrape along the side of her face. The Mog cannon is now a shattered pile of parts under her legs. She
watches me arrange the Chests under my arms, and I drop to a knee in front of her.
'You're coming with us.' I am not asking.
She opens her mouth to speak, and a trail of blood trickles out. It's then that I see the piece of metal sticking out of her shoulder. I put down one of
the Chests and try picking her up, but she groans and coughs up more blood. I let go, afraid if I move her again she'll bleed out and die before I can
find out where Sarah and Sam are.
'Where are they?' I ask. 'Tell me now! You are going to die any second, lady, and I'm trying to save Earth and my friends. Now, tell me! Where are
Sam and Sarah?'
Special Agent Walker's head flops in my direction and her green eyes open wide, as if seeing me for the first time. The gunfire outside is getting
closer. 'You . . . you're an alien,' she finally whispers.
I punch the side of the truck in frustration. 'Yeah, I am! But I'm here to help, if you would just let me! Now, before you run out of time, out of breath,
tell me where they are. In Washington?'
Her breathing turns ragged and it's as if she can't see or hear me. I'm losing her. I'm losing her and I still don't know where Sarah and Sam are.
My voice sounds small all of a sudden. 'Just tell me where they are. Please.' Our eyes meet and I can tell I've gotten through to her.
Special Agent Walker's mouth opens to speak and it takes a couple of tries to find her voice. 'Out west. In . . .,' then her voice trails off and her
eyes close. Her bloody hands clench and then relax; her whole body goes slack.
'Wait! Hold on!' I frantically grab at my Chest, trying to get it open so I can get my healing stone. All I can think is, if I heal her she'll tell me where
they are. I've just placed my hand on the lock of the Chest when a group of officers jump into the open end of the truck, guns drawn.
'Get away from the agent! Move! Or we'll shoot! Down on the ground! Hands behind your back! Now!' They are barking orders at me, but I can't
obey. I don't want to obey. I need to get the healing stone. I need hear what she was going to say. I reach to open the Chest and I hear the officers
screaming, 'Hands up. HANDS UP . HANDS UP !' I reach into my Chest anyway.
I hear the first gunshot, immediately followed by dozens more. As the hail of bullets fly around me, my wrist starts to tingle more strongly than ever.
It doesn't hurt anymore, and the bracelet starts to expand, covering my entire arm with a sheath of red material before spreading and popping open
like an umbrella. I have no idea what is going on and I really don't care. I can only think of my healing stone and the limp body of Walker so close
and yet so useless. Suddenly, I'm behind a six-foot-high shield that curls up over my head and under my feet. The bullets bounce right off of it.
An orchestra of gunfire erupts, and countless bullets ricochet off my shield. After a couple of minutes, they become less and less frequent, like
microwave popcorn that's almost done. When the gunshots finally stop, the red material compresses itself back into the arm sheath, and then
shrinks into the tingling bracelet around my wrist, all of its own volition. I look down, amazed at how effective it is, how perfect its timing is.
Walker is still lying unconscious by my feet. The officers with their guns trained on the back of the truck just a moment ago are gone, but I hear
gunfire outside. I'm torn between looking for my healing stone to revive Walker and going outside to see if Nine needs help. I want to wake her up,
force her to tell me where Sam and Sarah are, but I can't leave Nine alone if he's in trouble. I decide that Walker will keep – she's clearly not going
anywhere and I just have to hope she doesn't die on me. I take the opportunity to stuff a Chest under each arm and run out. As soon as I emerge I
see the officers running in the opposite direction. I don't know what Nine did while I was in there getting to know my bracelet a little better, but they
all look terrified.
'Ah, Nine?' I call over. 'What exactly did you do to them?'
He smiles. 'Just used my telekinesis to lift them all about thirty feet in the air. Then I offered them a choice: go higher or run away. I applaud the
wisdom of their decision, don't you?'
'Looks like they made the right choice,' I say.
'Hey, I thought we were bringing the agent woman with us,' Nine says.
'She's still inside – she's unconscious and I was going to use my healing stone on her, but I wanted to check on you first, make sure you were
okay,' I tell him.
'Dude, you were worried about me? I got this. We need her to tell us where we're going! You're the one who refuses to go anywhere that isn't
towards your friends. Remember?' Nine picks up an assault rifle and shoots it into the air. 'Get in there and get her! I'll be out here, playing with the
soldier toys.'
Officers continue to retreat on foot, some hiding behind trees on the side of the road. Nine aims the gun above their heads. The rifle rocks
against his shoulder and the bullets zip through the high branches. I can hear him cackling, enjoying the spectacle, as I move back to the truck.
I open my Chest to and pull out my healing stone and duck into the truck to see how badly Walker is injured.
But she's not there. I look around, as if she might have gotten up and moved to a different part of the truck. I'm completely confused by what I'm
seeing. What I am not seeing. There is no one there. The bodies that were there minutes ago are all gone. Shit.
I'm furious with myself. I can't believe how badly I've screwed this up. Not only do we still not know where they have Sam and Sarah, but it is likely
that Purdy and Walker are still out there.
11.
Number Eight is sitting in the grass. The lake is calm and still behind him. 'I am known by many different names. Some call me Vishnu, while
others call me Paramatma or Parameshwara. I am also known by my ten avatars, three of whom you have met and battled. Quite successfully, I
might add.'
'If they are your avatars, they are a part of you. Which means, you felt it necessary to declare war on three girls who were trying to reach you.'
Crayton spits out. 'You're supposed to be impersonating a peaceful god, aren't you?'
'You have a lot of explaining to do,' Marina adds. He is unmoved by our anger and remains seated. 'I had to be sure you are who you claim to be.
I had to be sure you were ready to meet me. My apologies if your feelings, or anything else, were hurt. You all proved yourselves, if that makes you
feel any better.' I'm fed up. I'm tired and hungry. Not to mention I flew across the world and fought an army to get here. I want answers. I stand up,
fists clenched at my sides. 'I'm going to ask a question, and if you don't answer me directly, we're leaving. This isn't a philosophical discussion; and
you had no right to test us. Are you, or are you not, Number Eight?'
He looks up at me and purses his lips. His skin color changes from blue to a deep copper tone. When he shakes his head, the crown falls off and
his black hair grows into a shaggy mop of curls. Two of his arms vanish, and in a matter of seconds, a shirtless teenage guy sits on the grass in
front of us. Commander Sharma gasps.
He's kind of thin, but toned. With his full lips and thick black eyebrows, I must say, he's kind of hot. Around his neck hangs a blue Lorien pendant.
He's one of us.
Ella looks over at Crayton, who exhales a long breath. He opens his mouth, about to say something, but the boy speaks first.
'My Cêpan originally named me Joseph, but I have gone by many names. In this region, most people know me by the name Naveen.' He pauses
and looks at me, then pulls up the ragged leg of his pants to reveal the scarred Loric symbols of One, Two and Three on his ankle. 'If you want to get
all Loric on me, then yes, you can call me Number Eight.'
The anger bubbling inside of me pops and disappears. We have found another member of the Garde. We just got stronger.
Crayton steps forward and offers his hand. 'We've been looking for you, Eight. We've traveled a long distance. I'm Crayton, Ella's Cêpan.'
Eight stands and shakes Crayton's hand. He's tall, and every muscle in his upper body and stomach is very well defined. He's clearly been
training for years, surviving alone in the mountains.
Ella stands as well. 'I'm Ella,' she says. 'I'm Number Ten.'
'Whoa!' Eight says. He looks into her eyes. 'What do you mean, you're Number Ten? There're only nine of us. Who told you you're Number Ten?'
All of a sudden, Ella shrinks down to become a six-year-old girl. I guess there's nothing quite like having your identity being questioned by a
former statue to give you a crisis of confidence. Crayton nudges Ella, and then, just as quickly, she transforms back into her tall, twelve-year-old self.
Eight responds by growing five feet taller to tower over her. 'That all you got, Ten?'
Determination covers Ella's face and it looks as if she's trying to grow another few years, but nothing happens. After a few seconds, she shrugs,
'I guess so.'
Crayton turns to Eight. 'I'll fill you in later, but there was another ship that left Lorien after yours. Ella and I were on that ship. She was just a baby at
the time.'
'Is that it, or is there a Number Thirty-Two I should know about?' Eight asks, shrinking back down to his regular height. His voice is husky, but also
kind. For the first time, I notice his eyes are the most amazing shade of deep green. By the look on Marina's face, she is noticing all of this too. I
can't help but smile as she nervously tucks her hair behind her ears.
'Ella's the last,' Crayton answers. 'This is Six, and this is Marina, Number Seven. You appear to be able to shape shift. Anything else we should
know about?' Crayton asks.
In response, Eight expands into a two-headed giraffe, towering twenty feet above us this time. I try to suppress my smile.
'Indeed I do have that Legacy,' the head on the left says.
The head on the right lowers to the water and takes a drink before looking up and adding, 'Among other things.'
'Oh, yeah? Like what?' Marina asks.
Eight turns back into a boy and skips along the surface of the pool as if it were solid ice. When he circles back to us, he begins to sprint before
skidding to a stop, sending a wave of water towards Marina.
But Marina is not going to get shown up by the new guy. Without flinching, she lifts her hands and stops the water midair, then pushes it back at
Eight with her telekinesis. He in turn blows the wave high into the air like a geyser. Not to be left out of whatever game it is they're playing, I take
control of the wind and I use it to push the geyser across the pool until a wall of moving water surrounds Eight on three sides.
'What else ya got?' I shout, my voice daring him to keep things going.
Eight disappears from where I've trapped him behind the water and an instant later reappears on the jagged rocks above the pool. He
disappears again and shows up inches from my nose.
Eight's sudden closeness is so jarring I reflexively throw a fist into his ribs. He grunts and stumbles backwards.
'Six! What are you doing?' Marina yells.
'Sorry,' I say. 'It was a reflex.'
'I deserved it,' says Eight, shrugging off Marina's protectiveness.
'So you can teleport?' Marina asks. 'That is very cool.'
He suddenly appears at her side and casually leans an arm on her shoulder. 'I'm a fan of it.' Marina giggles and shrugs him off. Giggles? Is she
kidding me?
Eight smiles, disappears and shows up again standing on Crayton's shoulders, balancing with exaggerated arm circles and wobbly legs.
'Sometimes I pick stupid places to land, though.' Eight is our jester, all of a sudden.
I'm struck by his playfulness, unsure if it's going to be an attribute or a liability. I decide to view it as a positive. I can just see the annoyance and
confusion on the Mogadorians' faces moments before this kid turns them to ash. Crayton leans forward and, as if they'd rehearsed the routine in
advance, Eight does a flip onto the ground, then claps his hands, obviously pleased with himself.
'Where's your Cêpan?' Marina asks.
Eight's cheerful face turns serious. We all know what this means. Instantly, my mind goes to an image of Katarina gagged and chained to a wall. I
think of John and his Cêpan, Henri. I shake away the memories before tears form in my eyes.
'How long ago?' Crayton gently asks the question we are all thinking.
Eight spins to look out over the field of high grass beyond us. With his mind, he parts the grass left and right until there's a narrow path. He raises
his head at the setting sun. 'Listen, we have to get out of here. The light is going. I'll tell you all about Reynolds and Lola on the way.'
Commander Sharma runs up to Eight and grabs his wrist. 'What about me? What can I do for you? Please tell me.' He startles me. I've been so
wrapped up in our little session of getting-to-know-you, and he's been so quiet, I completely forgot his role in all this.
'Commander,' Eight says. 'You have been a loyal friend to me and I want to thank you and your soldiers for all your hard work. Vishnu would be
very happy with your devotion. I'm afraid now we must part ways.'
It's clear by the expression on the commander's face that he thought he was in this for the long haul.
'But I don't understand. I have done everything you have asked of me. I brought you your friends. My men have died for you.'
Eight looks Commander Sharma in the eyes. 'I never wished for anyone to die for me. That's why I refused to leave the mountain and walk with
you in the streets. I'm sorry lives were lost, more sorry than you will ever know. Believe me, I know what it feels like to lose people. But, this is where
we must go our separate ways.' He's firm, but I can see it's hard for him to do this.
'But –'
Eight cuts him off. 'Good-bye, Commander.'
The man turns, a look of despair on his face. Poor guy. But he is a soldier who knows when to take an order, when to accept how things are
going to be. 'You're leaving me.'
'No,' Eight says. ' You are leaving me . You are off to something bigger and better. A wise man once told me that only by leaving someone good
can you meet someone better. You will be with your Vishnu, and you will only know him once I am gone.'
It's hard to watch. Commander Sharma opens his mouth to say something, but closes it when Eight turns and walks down the path without
looking back. At first, I think Eight is being too harsh. Then I realize, this is the kindest way he can do what must be done.
'Hey! Wait!' Crayton calls after Eight. 'The base of the mountain is the other way. We have to get to the airport.'
'First, I need to show you all something,' he calls back. 'And we may not need an airport.'
'Where are you going? There are things you don't know yet. We need to sit down and talk, we need to make a plan!' says Crayton.
'I wish I didn't break those glasses,' Ella says. 'We can't just follow him without knowing where he's taking us or if it's a good idea. He thinks he
knows everything, but he may not.'
We watch Crayton think about what to do. I know what think we should do. We've finally found another member of the Garde, and we have to stick
together now. I nod towards Eight's quickly disappearing figure. Crayton looks at me, then nods back. He scoops up Marina's Chest, and begins to
walk after Eight. Without saying anything, Marina and Ella hold hands and start to follow him. I get in line behind them. I use my advanced hearing to
listen for sounds of the commander moving from the spot where we left him. I hear nothing. I can picture him standing there, still and silent long after
we've left. I understand why it had to be done, but I still feel sorry for the guy. Left behind, after all his loyalty. I look at Eight's back, ramrod straight
ahead of me, and I feel bad for both of them.
Eight leads on. We follow him down a hill and find ourselves in a wide-open valley. Everywhere I look there are snow-tipped Himalayan
Mountains. Closer by, there are patches of forest with fields of yellow and purple flowers in between. It's beautiful. We're all soaking it in as we walk
when Crayton breaks the silence.
'So. Who were Reynolds and Lola?'
Eight slows so we can walk together. He reaches down to pick a handful of purple flowers only to crush them in his hand. 'Reynolds was my
Cêpan. He laughed a lot. He was always laughing. He laughed when we were on the run and when we slept under a bridge or hid in someone's
leaky barn in a monsoon.' He turns to look at us each in turn. 'Does anyone remember him?'
We all shake our heads, even Crayton. I wish I could. But I was only two years old when we made the journey.
Eight continues. 'He was a great Loric and an even better friend. But Lola . . . Lola was a human he fell in love with when we first got here. That
was eight years ago. They met at the market, and from that moment on they were inseparable. Reynolds was so in love. Lola moved in with us very
quickly. She barely left our house.' Eight kicks a patch of flowers. 'I should have known she couldn't be trusted by the way she looked at me, how
she always wanted to know where I was, what I was doing. I wouldn't let her near my Chest, no matter how many ways she tried. But Reynolds
trusted her so much, he eventually told her who we were. He told her everything.'
'Not smart,' I say. John told Sarah, and look at where that got them. Trusting humans with our secret is too risky. Love only makes it more risky.
'I can't even describe how angry I was. When I realized what he had done, I lost it. He and I fought for days. We had never argued before. I trusted
him completely, and it wasn't that I suddenly didn't trust him. It was her . That was when Lola started pushing us to come into the mountains with her
to hike and camp. She said she knew the perfect place. She convinced Reynolds it would help him make peace with me, for us to bond. I thought
Lola's plan to get Reynolds and me to kiss and make up was unlikely, but I went anyway.' He stops walking long enough to point at a mountain peak
due north. 'We went to that mountain right there. I brought along my Chest. By that point I could teleport and I had telekinesis, plus my strength was
off the charts – and I needed to train and figured the mountain air would help me get stronger, faster. But as soon as we arrived, Lola kept trying to
separate us. She did everything to get Reynolds to leave me alone. In the end, she had to make do with Plan B.' He turns away and resumes
walking. We give him a few steps to pull himself together.
'So what was Plan B?' Marina asks gently, trying to move him along. He needs to tell us all of this, but we don't have to torture him.
'On the third night in the mountains, she left to gather firewood, leaving me and Reynolds alone for the first time the whole trip. I knew something
was wrong. I felt it in the pit of my stomach. Lola returned quickly – with a dozen Mogadorian warriors. Reynolds, he was so in love with her, he was
heartbroken before he remembered to be scared. He screamed at her, begging her to explain why she would do this to him, to us, to me. Then one
of the warriors threw a bag of gold coins in Lola's general direction. She was promised a lot of money by the Mogadorians to provide a service.'
Eight sneers the word. 'Like a dog jumping on a treat, she dove at it. It all happened so fast. She dove, one of the Mogadorians raised a glowing
sword and stabbed her in the back, and the bag of coins exploded at her feet. Reynolds and I just stood there, frozen, watching her die.'
I resist the urge to dash ahead, grab his hand, and squeeze it to show how much I understand how he feels. I look at his straight, proud back,
watch the purpose in his long strides, and know what he needs right now is his space. At least, that's what I want when I think about Katarina dying.
His last word, die, hangs in the air. Finally, Crayton clears his throat and says, 'We don't need to hear any more right now. You can stop if you
want.'
'They couldn't kill me,' Eight's voice gets louder, as if he's trying to drown out the sad memories. I know the trick. It rarely works. 'Even when they
managed a direct hit with one of their swords, across my neck or into my stomach, I didn't die. But they did. The deadly cuts meant for me
happened to them instead. They couldn't kill me because of the charm, and I did everything I could to protect Reynolds. But we were separated in all
the chaos and I teleported too late. Reynolds was . . .' He pauses for a second. 'One of them took my Chest. I tried to stop him. I grabbed one of
their swords and I tried to stab him through his stomach, but I missed by this much. Pretty sure I took off his hand, though. Anyway, he got away.
Right after he ran into the woods, I saw a tiny silver ship shoot up through the trees. I killed the others.' His voice is so cold, so emotionless, I shiver.
'Me too,' I add. I glance over at Ella, who has moved closer to Crayton. At least she still has him. Hopefully we won't lose the last Cêpan that any
of us knows.
The sky above us grows darker by the second. Marina volunteers to walk in front so that she can lead the way with her Legacy of night vision. I
smile when she takes Eight's hand, happy that someone tries to comfort him.
'I've spent so much time in these mountains,' Eight says.
'All alone?' Ella asks.
'I was alone for some of it. I didn't know where to go. And then one day I came across an old man. He was sitting under a tree with his eyes
closed, praying. My Legacy to become other shapes had arrived months earlier, and I approached him in the form of a small, black rabbit. He felt
my approach. He laughed before he even opened his eyes. There was something about his face that I trusted. I guess he reminded me of
Reynolds, before Lola came into our lives. So I hopped into the bushes and teleported behind a line of trees in the opposite direction. When I
approached him again, in my regular form, he offered me some lettuce. It was clear that he knew me, would always know me, no matter what form I
took.'
'We're coming to another lake,' Marina says, interrupting Eight. Now that the talking has stopped, I can hear the lapping of water and a quiet
waterfall beyond.
'Yes, we're close,' Eight confirms. 'We'll eat and sleep soon.'
'So, then what happened? With the old man?' Crayton asks.
'His name was Devdan and he was a very enlightened, spiritual person. He told me all about Hinduism and Vishnu. I clung to his stories. In my
mind, they represented how we're trying to save Lorien. He taught me ancient forms of Indian martial arts, like kalarippayattu, silambam and gatka. I
worked with my Legacies, my powers, to see how far I could take what I learned from him.
'One day, I went to meet him in our usual spot and he wasn't there. I went back day after day. But he never returned and I was alone again. It was
many months later when I stumbled upon Commander Sharma and his army during a training exercise.' He hesitates before continuing.
'Unfortunately – or fortunately, I'm not sure yet – it was while I was in the shape of Vishnu and they vowed to protect me from any evils. I knew it was
because I was in a form they worshipped, and I hated preying on their beliefs, but I couldn't resist. I guess I hated being alone even more.'
Marina starts to lead us around the lake. Eight tells her to head for the waterfall we can hear in the distance.
'Did the Mogs ever come back?' Crayton asks.
'Yes. They still return in the tiny silver ships every so often, buzzing around the mountains to see if I'm still here. But I just turn into a fly or an ant
and they keep going.'
Crayton says, 'That lines up with all of the reports of UFO sightings in this region.'
'Yes, that's them,' Eight says. 'With every visit, they become more careless about detection. I haven't seen one in a few days, but they've been
much more frequent in the last six or eight months. I took this to mean the conflict was escalating.'
'It is,' I say. 'We've been finding each other, joining up. Marina, Ella, and I just met up in Spain a few days ago. Number Four is waiting for us
back in America. And now we've found you. That just leaves Five and Nine.'
Eight is silent for a moment. 'I want to thank you for traveling all this way for me. It's been so long since I've had anyone to talk to. To talk about my
real life.'
The waterfall is now just feet away. 'Now what?' I have to yell to be heard over the noise of the water.
'We climb!' Eight yells back, motioning to a sheer, stone wall in front of us.
I place my hand on the stone's smooth surface and tap my foot around to find a toehold. My foot im mediately slips, and when I'm about to try it
again, I hear Eight's voice far away, above me. He is already at the top, yelling something down at us. Teleportation is even better than I thought. It
may even be better than invisibility. I wonder if we can combine them somehow.
'Just use your telekinesis to float your way up,' Marina says to me. 'You get Ella. I'll get Crayton.'
I follow her advice and we float up. It's actually much easier than I imagined. Up at the top is Eight's campsite. Soon we're sitting around a fire,
cooking a vegetable stew in a large pot. The trees overhead form a thick canopy and, with the water below, it's a perfect spot to hide. Eight's mud
hut is somehow both depressing and ideal at the same time. The walls are uneven and the door is a lopsided oval; but it's also warm and dry, and it
smells of fresh flowers. Inside is a homemade hammock and a small table, and three colorful rugs hanging from the walls.
'Nice place you've got here,' I say, walking back to the fire. 'I've been on the run so long, I forget what it's like to have a home. Even a hut.'
'There is something about this place. There will always be a piece of me that remains here. I'm really going to miss it,' he says, looking around
fondly.
'So, does that mean you'll come with us?' Marina asks.
'Of course I will. The time has come for us to be together, to work together. Now that Setrákus Ra is here, I have to go with you.'
'He's here?' Crayton asks, suddenly uneasy.
Eight takes his first bite of stew. 'He arrived a few days ago. He's been visiting me in my dreams.'
12.
We jumped a freight train in West Virginia. I've been trying to sleep, but too many thoughts are swirling around in my mind. I squint as my eyes
adjust to the morning sun coming through the slatted door. I'm relieved to see we're still headed west. That's all Special Agent Walker said before
disappearing: west. So, that's where we're going. I try not to think about the possibility that she may have deliberately misled us, and instead focus
on how she thought she was about to die and had nothing left to lose, and therefore no reason to lie to me.
I roll onto my back. The ceiling of the train car is dirty, stained a variety of colors. I stare at a dark blue spot directly above my head for so long, I
finally drift off to sleep. I dream, which I often do. But this one is different, more of a nightmare than a vision.
I'm in West Virginia, back in the prison cell. Only this time, it is empty and brightly lit from above. The spherical cage that held Sam is now empty.
The only indication he was ever there is a pool of still-wet blood on the floor. I walk into the middle of the cell, look around frantically and try to
scream his name, but as soon as I open my mouth the bright lights from above are sucked into my throat, stealing my breath, choking me. I fall to my
hands and knees, trying to get some air.
Still gasping, I look up. Now I am in a large arena, with thousands of Mogadorians going wild in the stands. They chant and throw things down at
me while fights break out among them. The floor is a shiny black slab of rock. I rise from all fours shakily. When I take one step forward, the ground
behind me falls away, leaving only a black abyss. Above me is a giant hole and through this hole I see a group of clouds moving across a blue sky.
It takes me a moment to realize where I am – inside the peak of a mountain.
'Four!' It's Nine's voice. Nine! I'm not alone. I look around and try to yell back, but my throat is still clogged. A beam of light escapes my mouth.
Instinctively, I twist around and try to aim the light until it finally lands on Nine. He's on the other side of the arena, but something is blocking my view
of him. It's Sam. He's hanging between us, his wrists in shackles. Agent Purdy and Special Agent Walker stand below him, their Mogadorian
cannons aimed at Sam's chest. I don't hesitate. I run to my best friend, the rock falling away behind me with every step I take. The roar of the crowd
escalates until it's absolutely deafening.
When I've almost reached them, the black rock where the agents stand drops away, and they fall with it.
'Help! Help me, please, help me,' Sam yells, his body twisting, trying to break free from the shackles.
I try using my telekinesis to free him, but it doesn't work. I try to use my Lumen, but my palms remain dark. My Legacies are failing me.
'Bring the rest, John,' Sam says to me. 'Bring them all.'
His voice sounds strange, like it's not his. It's almost like someone – or something – evil is speaking through him.
Suddenly the tan, thin boy who appeared in my last vision is next to me. Once again, he's transparent, like a ghost. When I see he's wearing a
Loric pendant around his neck, I reach out for him. But he shakes his head at me and places a finger to his lips. The boy leaps onto Sam and
climbs up his legs and body until he can get his hands around the chains. I watch him strain, trying to pull apart the shackles, and I can see the
surprise on his face when he realizes he doesn't have the strength to do it.
In my last vision, he asked me what number I was, and I feel an enormous pull to speak to him. I cough, clear my throat, and I know my voice has
finally returned. I yell, 'I am Number Four!' just as the arena falls silent.
'Have you made your decision?' Sam asks. He continues to twist and turn in his shackles, the other boy still struggling to break his chains above
him. Sam looks right at me and I can see his eyes are a deep maroon color. This is not Sam, I tell myself.
All at once, Sam's body begins shaking so violently that the other boy loses his grip on him and I can only watch in horror as he falls and
disappears into the same chasm that swallowed the agents. A purple glow then surrounds Sam, and the chains break of their own accord. Instead
of falling, like the boy, like the agents, Sam floats, suspended in midair. A spotlight snaps on and I watch, disbelievingly, as Sam grows and
transforms – into Setrákus Ra. The three Loric pendants around Setrákus Ra's neck glow brightly, as does the purple scar circling his throat. 'Do
you want the human back?' he bellows.
'I will take him back!' I yell at him, furious. I'm rooted to the spot, nothing but abyss around me, nowhere to step on to get closer to him.
Setrákus floats slowly to the ground. He lands and the rocks show no sign of giving way as they have for the rest of us. 'This is your surrender?
Fine. I shall accept your pendant now.'
I look down and my pendant is already gone. I look up again to see it hanging from Setrákus Ra's giant fist. His cracked lips open to reveal a
sharp, crooked-toothed grin.
'No! I will not surrender!' The moment I say it, I feel a sudden weight around my neck. My pendant is back.
The other boy leaps from the chasm into which he fell and lands near Setrákus Ra, his head held high. The boy joins my cry, 'I will never surrender
to you! Let Devdan go, and fight me!'
'Time is running out,' Setrákus Ra says and I now realize he is speaking to both of us – that he has been the whole time. He was trying to get both
of us to surrender. Did he think he could convince us both to sacrifice ourselves in the belief that he would allow the others to live? I can only hope
none of the others fall for his tricks.
The blue stain on the ceiling of the train car is suddenly all I see, and I sit up abruptly, trying to shake off the dream that has left my brain fuzzy. I
touch the bracelet around my wrist. Before I drifted off into my vision, my nightmare, I had discovered that by concentrating on the bracelet's
abilities, I was able to remove it. But the moment it left my wrist, I felt unsafe without it and hurriedly popped it back on. I touch it again and wonder if
my reliance on it is a good or a bad thing. All of a sudden, something small bumps against my back and I jump up and spin around.
Clearly I'm on edge from my dream. It's just Bernie Kosar, this time as a beagle, my favorite incarnation of him.
'Another nightmare?' Nine yawns from the corner. He sits on his Chest, absentmindedly carving symbols into the wall with a nail, the very picture
of someone who is not on edge. The soles of his bare feet are black.
'They're getting really strange,' I say, and I hope I don't sound as shaken as I feel. Last thing I need is Nine seeing me as some kid, scared by
bad dreams. 'And I think others are having them at the same time.'
Nine lifts the nail to examine it more closely. He tilts his head, as if it's a rare specimen and not the most ordinary object in the world. With his
tongue sticking out of the corner of his mouth he looks as if he is concentrating all of his energies on this one nail. With a small smile, he bends it
between his fingers, snapping it into two perfectly equal pieces. He turns to face me. 'And what does that mean? You think they are all having
visions of some kind? Or, they are having the same action-packed nights you are?'
I shrug. 'I don't know. I keep seeing this really skinny kid with curly black hair. He's wearing one of our pendants, so I have to assume he's one of
us. We are aware of one another, but things in the dream seem to be tailored for him in some ways and to me in others. I see you in these visions
too.'
Nine frowns, then opens his Chest and digs around inside. I'm hoping he is going to pull out something that will help me decipher my visions, help
me figure out what, if anything, I'm supposed to do with them. 'I'd like to try to contact the others with the red stone, but I guess the government has it
tapped somehow. Which is total bullshit.' He sits back looking frustrated.
I walk across the empty car to where he's sitting. He has a yellow cube in his hand that I've never seen before. 'What do you think it means, if the
government has your stone tapped? How do you think it happened? I mean, it must have been the Mogs, but how did they convince the government
to work with them?'
Nine looks at me incredulously. 'Are you serious? Who cares why they're working together or what the Mogs had to say to get them on their side?
The point is, they are working together. The U.S. government and the Mogadorians have teamed up! For them, it is official: we are the bad guys!'
'But the Mogs will destroy Earth – or worse – once they get rid of us. Doesn't the government know this? Isn't it obvious that we're the good
guys?'
'Apparently not. Who knows how it happened? Maybe they're just using one another; both trying to double cross the other. Whatever it is, the
government has to be underestimating the Mogs. If they weren't, they'd be scared out of their freaking minds.' Nine places the yellow cube in his
mouth. A look of satisfaction appears on his face.
'What is that?' I ask.
'Sustenance,' he says, his voice garbled. 'It's a food substitute. You suck on it and it fills you up for a little bit. Take a look. You might have one
too.'
I unlock my Chest and poke around for a yellow cube. My hands pass over the white tablet we found in Malcolm Goode's hidden office in the well,
and I take a second to press its buttons. Still dead. I push it aside. I don't find a yellow cube, but there's a blue one. I hold it out for him to see. 'Do
you think this does the same thing?'
He shrugs. 'Dunno. Won't know till you try. Go for it.'
I hesitate for a few seconds, then place it on my tongue, and my mouth is immediately flooded with ice-cold water. I am only able to drink a little
before some goes down the wrong way, causing me to cough the stone onto the floor. Nine spits his yellow stone into his hand and offers it to me,
but I pass.
'You have to eat sometime,' he says.
Bernie Kosar walks over to Nine and opens his mouth. 'Sure, BK ,' Nine says obligingly, placing the yellow cube on the dog's tongue.
'At least we're headed west, where Sam and Sarah are. I'm sick of running and hiding, running and hiding. First things first, we find them.'
'Yeah, well, speak for yourself. I've been locked up and tortured for the past year, man. Being in motion, in control of where I am and when I'm
going there, is something I do not plan to give up anytime soon. Just relax, Johnny. I have an idea and you need to remember the plan. We're not
wasting time finding your human friends. We contact the others and meet up, and when we're ready, we face Setrákus Ra. In that order.'
I turn and punch a hole in the side of the train car, and the impact causes the wheels on one side to momentarily lose their grip on the tracks
below. I'm angry and I feel like I'm spiraling out of control. 'How exactly are we going to meet up with them when our only means of communication
might be being monitored? I say we head for California, or whatever government facility is out west, and we demand they give up Sarah, or we'll
start blowing stuff up! Or, we threaten to tell the media that the government is working with a bunch of evil aliens. We'll see how that goes over.'
Nine laughs, shaking his head. 'Um, no. That's not going to happen.'
'Well, shit, then I don't know what to suggest. What if we go back to Paradise to see if maybe Sarah's there. If I can just see that she's safe, I
promise I'll drop it. We have to be close to Ohio by now, don't we?'
Nine walks over to the hole I've created in the wall and peeks out. His voice is quiet when he speaks. 'It all looks the same to me, man. You know,
Earth has nothing on Lorien. Sure, Earth looks pretty nice in some places, but Lorien was beautiful everywhere. It was the most beautiful planet in
all the galaxies. You've seen how it used to be in your visions, right?' I'm surprised with how impassioned he's suddenly become. Talking about
Lorien his face is as happy and relaxed as I've ever seen it. For the first time I see a homesick kid. But it's fleeting. He quickly rearranges his face
into its usual mask of snark and dismissal.
'We are not going to Ohio to see if another one of your humans is all cozy and safe. This is not our home, Four. These humans are not our
brothers and sisters. Everything we do here on Earth is for our real home, for our real brothers and sisters; for the Elders who sacrificed their lives
to put us on that ship.'
Nine steps back, swings, and punches another hole in the wall of the car, right next to mine. Unlike mine, his punch is so hard and so fast that the
wheels underneath us don't shift. Nine sticks his head through the hole and he breathes deeply, his black hair blowing and flapping in the wind, then
pulls his head back inside. He clenches his fists and turns to look at me. 'If you don't have Lorien in your heart, then you should say so right now. I
won't run around with a traitor. Our only goal is doing everything we can to be at full strength so we can defeat Setrákus Ra and his army. That's it.
Got it?'
I decide to remain silent. My feelings for Sam and Sarah will never subside. I know this. But Nine is right about what comes first. We are of help to
no one if we do not increase our strength, and that only happens if we can find the others. I need to concentrate on Lorien. When we defeat
Setrákus Ra, Sam and Sarah – along with everyone else on Earth – will be okay. I nod.
Nine sits down and closes his eyes, hands clenching his knees so tightly his knuckles are white. 'We just passed a sign I recognize. We're a
couple hundred miles away from the safe house my Cêpan set up. We can go there, order a pizza, maybe watch a little TV . You can sit around and
sigh and think sad thoughts about your poor, lost Sarah. I will go out, find some hot chick to make out with for an hour or so, then we'll figure out how
to communicate with the rest in some other way.'
BK drops the yellow cube out of his mouth and looks up at me. He doesn't even have to ask. I place my blue cube on his tongue and he closes
his mouth and sighs happily.
I look over at Nine. He is so sure of himself, so confident. 'And how are we going to do that? The macrocosms are tapped! We have no other way
to communicate with them!'
'No, this is perfect,' Nine says, getting excited. 'Wait until you see my place, Four. It's totally badass. Whatever we want, we'll have. Whatever we
need, we'll get. We'll rest and train, we'll be in the most amazing shape, ready for whatever comes at us. And we will figure out a way to get in
contact with the rest of the Garde.'
13.
I lie awake for hours, sitting and watching the fire outside the hut. Inside, Ella sleeps on the hammock; Six and Crayton snore under blankets on
the floor. After a while, the fire goes from a raging and crackling blaze to glowing embers. I watch the smoke waft through the air, drifting to hang
around beneath the canopy of trees. Eventually, the fire dies out entirely.
I just can't sleep. For so many years, I was alone with my envy and anger, trapped in that orphanage. Now, finally, I can let it go. Now I believe
there's nothing we can't do with all of us together. So I don't know why I still feel this pit in my stomach whenever I get a moment to think. I know what
the pit is, too; I feel lonely. But I'm not alone, I keep telling myself.
I look over at Eight, sleeping as close as he can to the fire for warmth. In the early morning light, all curled up, he looks small. He sleeps restlessly,
under a thin blanket of twisted vines. I watch him toss and turn, running his hands through his already messy hair. I stoke the coals to create as much
heat as possible and the crackle is enough to make him stir. I don't know why, but I feel protective of him. At the same time, I think about his
muscular arms and I want him to protect me. Must be something about opposites attracting. He is playful and I am, well, not.
Crayton's forehead is creased with worry when he finally gets up and wakes the others. We all try to shake off the sleep cobwebs as quickly as
possible. I know Crayton is wondering how he's going to get us all on a plane.
My thoughts turn to Eight's vision of Setrákus. He poses the greatest threat of all, even more than a bunch of well-armed Mogs. I know Crayton
doesn't think we're ready to face Setrákus. We haven't developed our Legacies, we haven't had a chance to learn how to fight together, and we
must find Four, Five and Nine before we face a threat like Setrákus Ra. When I said as much last night, Eight shook his head, frustrated by all the
skepticism. 'I know we could take him, together,' he said. 'I've seen him in my dreams and felt his power. I know what he's capable of; but I also
know what we are capable of, and it is far greater than anything he could ever be. I believe in us. But it won't happen if we aren't all convinced.'
'I agree, we do need to bring down Setrákus Ra. But first we need to find the others. The chances of beating him are far better if you are all
together.' Crayton had argued. I could hear the worry in Crayton's words.
Eight stood firm, clearly believing we're enough to take him. 'My dreams have guided me to you all. And they tell me we can do this; we can't run
away, even if it is to find the others.'
Now Eight stands and stretches, revealing a bit of his stomach as his shirt lifts. He leans down and picks up a walking stick and twirls it in his
hands. I can't take my eyes off of him. It's such a new and unusual feeling for me and makes me feel shy and excited at the same time. 'So where
do you want to go?' he asks, looking around at all of us.
'East coast, United States,' Six says. She kicks the bottom of his walking stick as it swings by and it flips up and into her hand. These two are
quite the comedy duo. Six throws the stick back to him and he makes a big show of diving and missing it on purpose. Their play looks a lot
like flirting. I have to admit, it makes me jealous. Even if I wanted to, I could never be this way with Eight, with anyone. This is just how Six is, easy.
No wonder they're having so much fun.
'Okay, if that's where you want to go, we have a couple options. A plane? Do we have enough money to buy tickets for all of us?'
Crayton pats his shirt pocket, nodding. 'That shouldn't be a problem.'
'Great. We head back to New Delhi, buy some tickets, and we can be in the United States in a day or so . Or, we could be in the state of New
Mexico in just a few short hours.'
'We can't all teleport,' Six points out, drawing in the dirt with her toe.
'Maybe we can,' Eight says, a sly smile on his face. Six has drawn a circle and Eight reaches his foot over to add two eyes, a nose and a big
smiley face. They grin at each other. 'We just need to take a short walk, then it's a simple matter of a giant leap of faith.' He is clearly enjoying
keeping us in the dark; I see the others nodding at him, so caught up in his confidence they forget to ask for any details. I don't want to be the one to
point out we have no idea what he has in mind.
'Sounds a lot faster than a plane,' Ella says. 'And a whole lot cooler.'
'You've got my attention,' Crayton says, hefting my Chest up onto his shoulder. 'You need to show us what you're talking about, the quicker, the
better. If Setrákus Ra is already here on Earth, we've got to move fast.'
Eight holds up a finger, telling Crayton to be patient. Then, he pulls off his shirt and pants. Wow. 'Not before my morning swim,' he says.
Eight sprints to the edge of the cliff where the waterfall drops off. Without pausing, he dives with his hands out at the side. Like a bird, he seems
to float, riding the waves of air. I rush to the edge of the cliff and look over the side, just in time to see him change shape and enter the water as a
red swordfish, and then surface as himself. I suddenly get the urge to jump in too, and I follow him.
The water is startlingly cool when I dive in, but when I come up for air I can feel my face is flushed. What is going on with me? I'm not usually this
impulsive.
'Nice dive,' Eight says, swimming over and treading water close to me. He shakes his head and his black, glistening curls whip around his head.
'So, do you prefer being called Marina or Seven?'
'I don't care. Whatever,' I say, feeling shy.
'I like Marina,' he says, speaking decisively for both of us. 'Is this your first time in India, Marina?'
'Yes. I was in Spain for a long time. In an orphanage.'
'An orphanage, huh? At least you had lots of kids around you; you could make friends. Not like me.'
I can see how lonely he's been. I decide not to correct him and tell him how all the other girls hated me and I had no friends until Ella showed up. I
just shrug. 'I guess. I'm happier now.'
'You know what? I like you, Marina,' he says. It sounds like he is rolling my name around in his mouth, savoring it. 'You're quiet, but cool. You
remind me of –'
Suddenly, there's a huge splash right between Eight and me. The waves rock us away from each other and I watch Six emerge, her wet blond
hair falling perfectly down her back. She doesn't say a word then dives back under the water, pulling Eight with her. I dive too, and watch them
wrestle underwater until Eight, laughing, begs for mercy and Six lets him go.
'Damn, you're strong,' he says as he breaks the surface, coughing.
'And don't you forget it,' she says, grinning. 'Now, can we please get out of here?'
The sight of Six and Eight all tangled up makes me jealous, but this is not the time for it. I duck my head under water to give myself a minute to
pull myself together. I let the water enter my lungs and I sink and sink, until my toes touch the muddy and rocky floor. I sit down in the mush and try to
collect my thoughts. I'm angry at myself for feeling so vulnerable. This is a crush! Nothing more. And do I really care if Eight prefers Six's perfect,
blond hair to my mop? I mean, she isn't a threat to me. We have to work as a team, trust each other. I don't want to be angry with Six, especially
after everything she has done for me. For a minute I pace around the bottom, hoping to come up with something witty to say when I surface. I can do
this.
I realize I'm directly under the spot where the waterfall enters the pool, where the water is clear and sparkling. The glint off something catches my
eye. It's a long silver object stuck in the muddy floor.
I go to take a closer look. It's maybe fifteen feet long and, when I circle it, I'm stunned to realize it's some sort of cockpit behind a long windshield.
That's when I see a Chest, just sitting there on the seat inside. I can't believe it – is it possible that this is the silver ship that Eight saw fly away the
day that the Mogs attacked, the day that his Cêpan was killed? I hear a muffled cry and realize it's mine. I grab a handle on the fuselage, and pull. It
doesn't budge. The pressure at the bottom of the lake is so strong, but I keep pulling and soon the cockpit door swings open. A rush of water mixes
with water that was trapped inside. The Chest is slimy when I grab it and race for the surface.
The first thing I see is Six and Eight, sitting in the grass and talking. Ella is twirling Eight's walking stick over her head, then out in front of her.
Crayton is watching Ella, his chin cupped in his hands. Ella sees me coming out of the water and spikes the stick into the grass.
'Marina!' she calls.
'Hey, there you are! Where'd you go?' Eight yells, coming over to the edge.
'Come on out, Marina,' Six calls. 'We really have to boogie now!'
I lift the Chest up and out of the water, holding it aloft so they can all see it. I don't even care the most revolting, mucky water is pouring off it and
onto my head. I'm grinning so wide, my face hurts. I love the looks on their faces, mouths agape and eyes wide. I'm enjoying it so much I use my
telekinesis to float the Chest over to Eight and Six and leave it there, in midair.
'Look what I found, Eight!'
Eight disappears from the grass and reappears up in the air next to the Chest. He wraps his arms around it and hugs it. Slime and all. Then he
teleports back to the edge of the lake, the Chest still in his hands. 'I can't believe it,' Eight finally says. 'All this time, it was right here.' He looks
stunned.
'It was inside a Mog ship at the bottom of the lake,' I say, walking out of the water.
Eight disappears again and teleports directly in front of me, our noses practically touching. Before I can register how nice his warm breath feels
on my face, he picks me up and kisses me hard on the mouth as he twirls me around. My body stiffens and I suddenly have no idea what to do with
my hands. I don't know what to do at all, so I just let it happen. He tastes salty and sweet at the same time. The whole world disappears and I feel as
if I'm floating in darkness.
When he sets me down, I pull back and look into his eyes. One glance and I know this huge, romantic moment was a spontaneous and grateful
gesture for him. No more, no less. I'm an idiot. I really need to let this crush go.
'I never swim over here. From the start, I always dove off on the other side there,' Eight says. 'Stuck in the same area.' He shakes his head.
'Thank you, Marina.'
'Um, you're welcome,' I whisper, still dazed by the first part of his thank-you.
'Now that you've hugged it hello, don't you want to open it?' Crayton asks. 'Come on, already!'
'Oh! Right, of course!' Eight yells, and he teleports back to the Chest.
Six walks towards me. 'Marina! That was so awesome!' She hugs me, then pulls away to shake me by the shoulders, smiling at me meaningfully.
In a low voice, she whispers, 'And am I seeing things, or did you just get kissed?'
'Kind of weird, right?' I whisper, watching her for any signs of jealousy. 'But I don't think it means anything.'
'Not weird at all. I think it's kind of great,' she says, clearly thrilled for me, like a friend, or a sister. I'm ashamed of myself, for feeling jealous of her
earlier. We both look over at Eight as Ella begins to make a drumroll noise to announce the Chest's opening.
Eight has his palms on the lock. Almost immediately, it shakes and the Chest falls open. He quickly dives in elbowdeep, trying to touch everything
all at once. He's like a kid in a toy chest; he's so excited. We all crowd around and watch. I can see some of the stones look like mine, but other
items are completely different. There's a glass ring, a curved antler, a black piece of cloth that shimmers blue and red when Eight touches it. He
grabs a thin piece of gold the length of a pencil and holds it up. 'Ahh, good to see you again.'
'What is that?' Six asks.
'I don't know its real name, but I call it “the Duplicator.” ' Eight holds it above his head, like a wand. Then he snaps his wrist and it expands out,
and down, like a scroll. Soon, it's the size of a doorframe. He lets go and the frame hovers in front of him. Eight steps behind and we can see the
occasional pair of hands and feet when he starts doing jumping jacks.
'Okay,' Six says. 'That is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.'
Eight teleports to her side and stands there, head cocked to the side as he scratches his chin, like he's judging a show. Our heads snap back to
the golden doorframe. The hands and feet are continuing their steady pace. Wait. There are two of him now! The one standing next to Six claps,
opens his palm, and the piece of gold contracts and zips back into his hand. Immediately, the second Eight disappears.
'Impressive,' Crayton says, clapping his hands slowly and loudly. ' That will come in very handy sometime soon. At the very least, you will make
an excellent distraction.'
'I used it to sneak out of our house a few times,' Eight admits. 'Reynolds never figured out what I could do. Even before he died, I was always
trying to figure out how to do the most with my Legacies.'
Crayton throws Eight's clothes to him, and picks up my Chest. 'Now, we really need to get going.'
'Aw, come on,' Eight says, pulling on his pants. As he hops about, he bats his eyes at Crayton and says in a wheedling voice, 'I just got my Chest
back. Can't I get reacquainted with it? I've missed it so much.'
'Later,' Crayton says curtly. When he turns towards us, though, I can see he is smiling.
Eight drops the piece of gold inside the Chest and pulls out a green crystal, stuffing it into his pocket. He closes the Chest and picks it up with a
dramatic sigh. In his most pathetic voice he says, 'Oh, all right. Our reunion will just have to wait. Follow me, everybody.'
'How often has Setrákus visited you in your dreams?' Crayton asks. We've been walking more than five hours and we're making slow progress
up the mountain. Eight is leading us up a winding path that is more ledge than road. There's a thin blanket of snow everywhere, and the wind is
brutally strong. We're all freezing, but Six protects us with her Legacy, pushing the wind and snow out of our way. Weather control is one of the more
useful Legacies, that's for sure.
'He's been talking to me for a while now, trying to trick me and get me to lose my temper,' Eight says. 'But now that he's on Earth, it's a lot more
frequent. He taunts me, lies, and now he's trying to get me to sacrifice myself so that you all can go back to Lorien. He's been getting to me more
than usual lately.'
'What does that mean, exactly? “Getting to you”?' Crayton asks.
'Last night in a vision he showed me my friend Devdan hanging from chains. I don't know if it's a vision of something that's actually happening or
just a trick, but it's really messing with my head.'
'Four sees him, too,' Six chimes in.
Eight spins around with a surprised look on his face and walks backwards, his mind clearly putting the pieces together. His foot comes
dangerously close to slipping off the ledge, making me gasp and reach out nervously. But he never wavers as he continues. 'You know, I think I saw
him last night. I forgot about it until now. He has blond hair? Tall guy?'
'And better looking than you? Yup, that's him,' Six says with a smile.
Eight stops backpedaling and looks thoughtful. The drop off to our left is almost two thousand feet. 'You know, I always assumed it was me, but
guess I was wrong,' he says thoughtfully.
'Assumed you were what?' I ask, willing him away from the edge.
'Pittacus Lore.'
'Why would you think that?' Crayton asks.
'Because Reynolds told me that Pittacus and Setrákus were always able to communicate with each other. But now that I know Four can, too, I'm
confused.'
Eight starts walking forwards again when Ella asks, 'How can anyone be Pittacus?'
'Each of us is supposed to take on the roles of the original ten Elders, so I guess that means one of us will take on Pittacus's role,' Six explains.
'Four's Cêpan told him so, in a letter. I read it myself. Eventually, we're supposed to become even stronger than them. That's why the Mogs are
moving so quickly now, before we become more dangerous, better able to protect ourselves and attack them.' She looks over at Crayton, who is
nodding as she speaks.
I feel like I'm the only one who knows so little – nothing, really – of my history. Adelina refused to tell me anything, to answer a single one of my
questions, or even hint at what I would one day be capable of. Now, I'm so far behind everyone else. The only Elder I even know of is Pittacus, never
mind knowing which one I might become. I just have to believe I'll figure out who I am when the time is right. Sometimes, I get sad when I think about
everything I wish I already knew and when I think about what my childhood should have been. But there's no time for me to mourn what can't be
changed.
Ella comes to walk with me, brushing her hand against mine. 'You look sad. You okay?'
I smile at her. 'I'm not sad. But I am mad at myself. I've always blamed Adelina for why I haven't developed my Legacies the way that I might have.
But look at Eight. He lost his Cêpan, but took what he had and just kept working at it.'
We walk together in silence for a few more minutes, until Eight speaks. 'Do you ever wish the Elders had given us our Inheritance in locked
backpacks instead?' Eight says, switching his Chest to the other arm.
I look guiltily at Crayton. I move to take my Chest from him, but he just pushes me away gently.
'I have it for now, Marina. Soon enough I'm sure you'll need to bear its burden alone, but I'll help while I can.'
We walk for another few minutes until the path along the ridge suddenly ends at a steep cliff. We're a few hundred feet from the peak, and I stare
over the Himalayas spread out on my left. The mountains are vast and seem endless. It's a breathtaking sight, one I hope I'll remember forever.
'So, now where?' Six asks, looking skeptically up at the mountain. 'There is no way we can go straight up the peak. There don't seem to be a lot
of other options, though.'
Eight points at two tall, hulking boulders leaning against the mountainside, and then clenches his hand. The boulders separate, revealing a
curved stone staircase that winds around and leads inside the rock face. We follow Eight up to the stairs. I feel both claustrophobic and vulnerable.
If someone follows us, there's no way out.
'Almost there,' Eight says over his shoulder.
The stairs are so cold; their iciness seeps up through my feet and body. They finally lead us to a huge rock cavern that has been carved out of the
mountain.
We pour into it, gazing around in awe. The ceiling is a couple hundred feet high, and the walls are smooth and polished. Carved deep into one of
the walls are two sets of vertical lines several feet high and spaced five feet apart. A small blue triangle sits between the two lines, with three more
curved lines carved horizontally above it.
'Is that supposed to be a door?' I ask, following the lines with my eyes.
Eight steps aside, to let all of us see better. 'It's not supposed to be; it is a door. It's a door to the far corners of the Earth.'
14.
I pull my hoodie up over my head and hunch my shoulders. Nine's wearing a dirty Cubs cap and cracked sunglasses, items he found in the train
yard where we jumped off. After an hour's walk south, we're standing against the wall of a platform, waiting for another train. This one is elevated.
The el, as Chicagoans call it. The Chests in our arms stand out against the other passenger's briefcases and backpacks, and I do my best to act
casual. Bernie Kosar sleeps comfortably inside my shirt, now a chameleon. Nine is still kind of pissed that I was skeptical that anyone would put a
safe house in such a densely populated area. I know Henri would never have chosen such an exposed place.
We don't speak as the train rumbles into the station. Bells chime, the doors slide open, and Nine leads me into the last car. When the train pulls
away, we watch the city of Chicago slowly grow closer.
'Just enjoy the view for now,' Nine says. He looks more and more at peace the closer we get to the city. 'I'll tell you more when we get off.'
I've never been to Chicago before. We pass what feels like a million apartment buildings and houses as we clatter through the different
neighborhoods. The streets below are full of cars, trucks, people, dogs being walked, babies being pushed in strollers. Everyone looks so happy,
and safe. I can't help but wish I were one of them. Just going to work or school, maybe for a walk with Sarah to get a cup of coffee. A normal life.
Such a simple idea, but it's almost impossible for me to picture. The train stops, people stream off and others push to get on. The train gets so
crowded that two girls, a blonde and a brunette, are forced to stand practically leaning over us.
'Like I said,' Nine says, smiling happily, 'just enjoy the view.'
After a few minutes, the blonde kicks the Chest under my feet. 'Ow! Jeez, guys. What's with the ginormous boxes?'
'Vacuum cleaners.' I'm nervous and Nine's story from the other night is the first thing that pops into my mind. 'We're, uh, salesmen.'
'Really?' The brunette asks. She looks disappointed. I sag a bit; even I'm a bit disappointed in my fictional life.
Nine takes off his cracked sunglasses and elbows me in the ribs. 'That was a joke. My friend here, he thinks he's so funny. Actually, we work for
an art collector and we're taking these artifacts down to the Art Institute of Chicago.'
'Oh, yeah?' the blonde asks. The two girls glance at each other and look pleased. As she turns back to us, she tucks her hair behind her ear. 'I'm
a student there.'
'Seriously?' Nine says with a pleased smile.
The brunette bends down, looking curiously at the intricate carvings on the lid of my Chest. I hate that she's so close to it. 'So, what's inside?
Pirate treasure?'
We should not be talking to them. We shouldn't be talking to anyone. We're no longer just teenagers trying to blend in with the humans around us.
We are alien fugitives who just destroyed a fleet of government vehicles. There's a bounty on my head and I bet they're putting one together for
Nine right now. We should be hiding in the middle of nowhere, back in Ohio, or even out west. Anywhere but sitting on a packed train in the middle
of Chicago, flirting with girls! I open my mouth to say that the Chests are empty, to make them stop asking questions and leave us alone, but Nine
talks first. 'Maybe my friend and I could swing by your place later this evening. We'd love to show you what's inside then.'
'Why don't you just show us now?' the brunette asks with a pout.
Nine looks left and then right. He's really hamming it up. 'Because I don't trust you yet. You two are kind of, ah, suspicious. You know that, right?
Two beautiful girls like you, you're right out of a spy movie.' He winks at me. It suddenly dawns on me; he's just as bad around girls as I am. He
overcompensates and looks kind of ridiculous doing it. It makes me like him more, even if he is totally embarrassing us both.
The girls look at each other and smile. The blonde digs into her purse, scrawls something on a scrap of paper and hands it to him. 'The next stop
is ours. Give me a call after seven and we'll think about hooking up with you guys somewhere later. I'm Nora.' I'm stunned his stunt worked.
'I'm Sarah,' the brunette says. Of course that's her name. I shake my head. If that isn't a blinking sign that we must end this conversation now, I
don't know what is.
Nine reaches his hand out to shake theirs. 'I'm Tony, and this handsome stud next to me is Donald.' I clench my teeth and give them a polite
wave. Donald?
'Cool,' Nora says. 'Well, talk to you later.' The train stops and they get off. Nine leans over and waves to them through the window. After the train
pulls out of the station, Nine chuckles to himself. He is looking very smug.
I elbow him in the ribs. 'Are you nuts? Why would you deliberately draw that kind of attention to yourself – to us? You had no right to drag me into
your stupidity. And, why in the world would you do anything to encourage them to look at our Chests? Let's hope any girl stupid enough to buy your
crap is too stupid to think too hard about any of it!' I liked him a whole lot better when he just looked like a loser.
'Calm down, Donald. You think you could keep your voice from squeaking so loud? It's no big deal. Nothing is going to happen to us here.' He
leans back, hands folded behind his head. When he speaks again, though, he doesn't sound so puffed up. 'Sandor would have been so damn
proud of me just now, you know? I bet you'd never know it, but normally, I'm crazy nervous around girls. And the more I like them, the worse it is. No
more. After what I've been through this past year, nothing really scares me anymore.'
I don't respond. I slump down in my seat and watch the city get taller and taller, the architecture more interesting. There are playhouses, shops
and beautiful restaurants all wrapped in glass. Some of the buildings shine so bright in the sun I have to shield my eyes. Cars clog the roads below
us, their honks reaching us up on the track. No place could be more different from Paradise, Ohio. Our train stops and starts up again through two
more stations, then Nine tells me to stand up. We're next. A minute later we're walking east on Chicago Avenue, each of us carrying our Chest
under an arm. Lake Michigan is straight ahead.
When the crowd around us thins, Nine says, 'Sandor loved Chicago. And he thought it was smart to hide in plain sight in a city like this. No
chance of sticking out, always a crowd to disappear into, that kind of thing. I mean, think about it, where are you more anonymous than in a busy
city?'
'Henri would never have allowed it. Being in a city like this would have freaked him out. He hated being anywhere he couldn't keep an eye on
anyone who might have an eye on us. On me.'
'And that's why Sandor was the best Cêpan that ever lived. He had rules, of course. First and most important, “don't be stupid.” ' Nine sighs.
Amazingly, he has no idea how infuriating, how insulting this talk about Sandor is.
I'm pissed and I don't care who knows it. 'Oh, yeah, if Sandor was so great, why did I find you in a Mogadorian prison cell?' I feel horrible the
minute I say it. Nine misses Sandor, and we're in the last place they spent real time together, where Sandor told Nine he was safe. I know how
powerful that kind of assurance is.
Nine stops dead, right in the middle of a busy corner with people streaming past us. He steps up to me until our noses are inches apart. His fists
are clenched, not to mention his teeth. 'You found me in that cell because made a mistake. It was my mistake, not Sandor's. And you know what?
Where's your Cêpan? You think yours was so much better than mine? Wake up, idiot! They're both dead, so I really doubt one was so much better
than the other.'
I feel bad for what I said but I'm sick of Nine trying to bully me. I push him away. 'Back off, Nine. I mean it. Just. Back. Off. And stop talking to me
like I'm your little brother.'
The light changes and we cross the street, both of us fuming. I follow him onto Michigan Avenue and we walk in silence. At first I'm too angry to
pay attention to my surroundings, but slowly I become aware of the skyscrapers above me. I can't help it. This city is awesome. I look around. Nine
sees me admiring the city, his city, and I can feel his mood softening.
'You see that big black one with the white spires on top?' Nine asks. He looks so happy to see this building I forget I'm pissed at him. I look
straight up. 'That's the John Hancock Center. It's the sixth tallest building in the country. And that, little brother, is where we're headed.'
I snatch him by the arm and pull him to the side of the sidewalk. 'Wait a minute. That's your safe house? One of the tallest buildings in the city is
where you think we're going to hide? You've got to be kidding me. That's nuts.'
Nine laughs at the incredulous look on my face. 'I know, I know. It was Sandor's idea. The more I think about it, the more brilliant I realize he was.
We stayed here for over five years, no problems. Hiding in plain sight, baby, hiding in plain sight.'
'Right. Are you forgetting about the part where you got caught? We are not staying there, Nine. Not a chance in hell. We need to go back to the
train, figure out a new plan.'
Nine rips his arm out of my grip. 'We got caught, Donald, because of someone I thought was my friend. She'd been working with the Mogs and I
was too stupid to notice. She betrayed me and I couldn't see beyond her nice ass, so Sandor was captured. I watched him being tortured, and
there was nothing I could do to stop it. The one person I loved more than anyone in the world. In the end, the only thing I could do for Sandor was put
him out of his agony. Death. The gift that keeps on giving.' His sneer can't hide the pain in his voice. 'Fast-forward one year and I see your ugly face
outside my prison cell.' He points up at the John Hancock Center. 'Up there, we were safe. It's the safest place you'll ever be.'
'We'll be trapped,' I say. 'If the Mogs find us up there, there's nowhere to run.'
'Oh, you'd be surprised.' He winks and then walks towards the building.
All of a sudden I am very conscious of just how many people are going by us. I'm nervous as hell, without a single clue where else I should be or
go. One thing I know for sure, the Mogadorians keep getting better at blending in, so I have zero confidence we'd even know it if one just brushed
by. This thought terrifies me so much I literally twitch as it occurs to me. And I have to assume there are thousands of cameras all over Chicago, and
with the Mogs and the government working together, the Mogs probably have access to them. Great. We're on some predatory Candid Camera
and there is nothing we can do about it. Inside, anywhere inside, is going to be safer than standing around out here. I put my head down and follow
Nine.
The lobby is amazingly luxurious. There's a grand piano, leather furniture, and sparkly chandeliers. At the far end I see two security desks. Nine
hands me his Chest and takes off his cap. One of the security guards is a large bald guy who is seated behind the desk, until, that is, he sees Nine.
Then, he lets out a howl and leaps to his feet.
'Hey! Will you look at who the cat dragged in! You don't write, you don't call, where the heck have you been?' the man asks, shaking Nine's hand,
his other hand clutching his arm. He just stands there, beaming at Nine. The long-lost son returns, and all that, I guess.
Nine is grinning at him with real affection and puts his other hand on the man's shoulder, 'Oh, I think a better question is, where haven't I been?'
'Next time, tell us when you're taking off. I worry! Now, where's that uncle of yours?' He looks over Nine's shoulder, as if expecting Sandor to
come up behind him.
Nine doesn't miss a beat. 'Europe. France, actually.' No flinch, nothing. He's good. I know how hard this must be for him.
'He got some kind of visiting teaching gig?'
'Yup,' Nine says. He nods at me. 'It's a long gig, he's thinking about maybe even taking a permanent spot, so I've been staying with my friend
Donald on the south side. We need to hang upstairs for a while so we can work on a history project. Check out these boxes, man, we have work to
last us months!'
I look down at the Chests in my arms and the security guard stands aside and lets us walk past. 'Sounds like you guys have yourselves a plan.
Hey, nice to meet you, Donald. Good luck with your project!'
'Same here,' I say. 'And, thanks!' I'm trying to sound friendly, but it's hard. Nine is clearly fine with this guy knowing his comings and goings,
noticing his absence, setting up a lie it might be hard to back up later on. But I hear Henri's voice in my head, warning me this is the exact opposite
of what we should be doing. I try to shake off the nerves making my stomach do flips. Second-guessing things won't help.
We make our way to a small elevator bank and Nine presses a number. The light above one of the sets of elevator doors brightens with a big
arrow pointing up.
'Oh, hey, Stanley?' The security officer jogs over just as we are about to step through the elevator doors, his keys jingling on his belt.
I look at Nine with a smirk. 'Stanley?' I mouth. That's worse than Donald!
'Not now,' he mumbles back.
'I've got a bunch of packages for you. We've been holding them in storage. We didn't know where you were and you didn't leave a forwarding
address. You want me to send them up?'
'Give us an hour to settle in first, okay?' Nine asks.
'Absolutely, boss.' The guard salutes as we step into the elevator.
Once the doors are closed, I feel Bernie Kosar crawl from one of my shoulders to the other, and back again. He tells me he's tired of hiding. 'Just
a few more minutes,' I say.
'Yeah, BK ,' Nine says. 'We are just about home. Finally.'
'How could you be so confident this place would be yours to come back to? I mean, you've been gone a really long time.' There seems to be no
situation, no idea that makes Nine second-guess what he believes. I wish I could be like that. Even if he isn't always right, it makes for a great team
member and an even better warrior.
'Sandor set everything up. Payments for this place are made automatically from his account. We always kept things pretty vague about what he
did. And we referred to his “teaching gigs” the other times when we went away for months. Clearly, people bought it.'
Nine presses a series of numbers into a small keypad below the floor numbers and the elevator rockets upwards. The numbers increase so fast I
barely have time to think about how high we're going. We pass the eightieth floor and then start to slow down. We come to a stop and the doors
open silently, and we step directly into an apartment. I look up at the huge crystal chandelier hanging above two couches in the living room.
I see a camera in the upper right-hand corner of the room, pointed our way, and instantly shield my face. But Nine explains it's a closed-circuit
camera that can be monitored only from inside the apartment.
'After you,' he says, bowing low and sweeping his arm in welcome with an exaggerated flourish.
'I can't believe you guys have the whole floor,' I say, looking around with my mouth agape.
I hear Nine's hand slide along the wall as he says, ' Two whole floors, as a matter of fact.' Nine hits another switch and dozens of dark shades
rise to reveal floor-to-ceiling windows. The room is bathed in sunlight. Bernie Kosar leaps out of my jacket and turns into a beagle. I walk over to the
window and look out at the view. It's incredible. The whole city of Chicago is spread out below. Lake Michigan is a sheet of bright blue on the left. I
set my Chest on a plush recliner and place my forehead against the window. As I look down on the roofs of other buildings, I hear something start to
whir in the apartment behind me, then feel a whoosh of fresh air from the vents near my feet.
'Hey, you hungry?' Nine asks.
'Sure,' I say. It's weird, but from this height, everything looks fake: the cars, the boats on the water, the trains snaking around on the elevated
tracks. To my surprise, I do feel safe; I mean, really safe. I actually feel as if nothing can touch me, get me, up here. It's been a long time since I felt
this way. It's almost strange.
I hear the door to a refrigerator open. 'I am so psyched to finally relax,' Nine calls from the kitchen. 'Hey, make yourself at home; take a shower,
eat some frozen pizza. We even have time to chill, sleep, before it's time to call those girls. When was the last time you could say any of that? Man,
it is good to be home.'
It's hard to turn away from the view; it's kind of mesmerizing. I want to just stand here, right here in this spot, and enjoy feeling safe. The only thing
better would be if Henri and Sarah and Sam and Six were here with me.
Something soft and crinkly hits the back of my head. An energy bar.
'Let me show you around.' Nine's giddy, like he's psyched to show off his toys.
I munch on the bar as we walk through a living room filled with plush couches and leather recliners. A giant flat-screen television hangs above a
marble fireplace, and on the glass coffee table stands a vase of fake orchids. There is a layer of dust on every surface. Nine says he'll get a
cleaning service up to deal with it as he runs a finger over one particularly well-coated table. In the hallway, he opens the first door on the right.
My jaw drops. Standing there are two huge Mogadorian soldiers with alabaster skin and long black hair, wearing black trench coats. They stand
just inside, guns poised and ready to shoot. The weeks of training with Six and Sam surge through my brain and I rush the closest one and duck
under his cannon, then I deliver an uppercut to his chin and follow that with a thrust kick to his abdomen. The Mog is stunned and falls straight
backwards. I look around for something to stab him with, but all I see are free weights and punching gloves. That's when Nine runs in and playfully
kicks the other Mogadorian in the groin before flicking its nose. His Mog wobbles on its heels before tipping sideways. It takes one more second
before I realize these are just dummies. Nine doubles over and when he finally catches his breath, he slaps my back.
'My, my, those are some fine reflexes!' he howls.
My cheeks are blazing hot. 'You could have warned me.'
'Are you kidding? I've been thinking about doing that to you since we got on the el. Man, that was great!'
Bernie Kosar enters the room and sniffs at the rubber feet of the Mogadorian I leveled. He looks up at me.
'They're for training, BK ,' Nine says, chest puffed proudly, sweeping an arm out wide. 'We call it the Lecture Hall.'
I take my first real look around. It's a huge, empty room. On the far end, there's a control panel, like a cockpit. Nine walks over and sits at the
console and starts flicking switches and typing in commands. From the walls, the ceiling and the floor, combat situations and weapons. He spins
the chair around to face me, eager to see how impressed I am. I'm immediately jealous of the time he must have spent here. And it shows.
'This is . . .' I raise my eyes to the ceiling. I can't even find the words. It makes me embarrassed about what I've been doing all this time. My so-
called training space was the snow in my backyard, or with Six and Sam at the pool. Suddenly, I'm resentful about Henri moving us around so often,
not giving me the kind of training I clearly needed to do my part. If we had made a place like this, then maybe I would be as confident and strong as
Nine. Maybe Sandor really was the better Cêpan.
'You haven't seen the best part yet,' Nine says.
We move through the training room and he spins opens a vaultlike door in the back. There are shelves and shelves of weapons: guns, swords,
knives, explosives and more. There's a whole wall just for ammunition.
Nine pulls a large automatic rifle topped with a scope off a shelf and aims it at me. 'You'd be surprised how easy it was to buy all this stuff. Gotta
love the Internet.'
He walks towards me with the gun and pushes a button over my shoulder. The far end of the room separates to uncover a firing range longer than
a bowling alley. Nine grabs a box of bullets and loads the rifle. Then I watch as he blows to bits a paper target ninety feet away. 'Don't worry. These
rooms are pretty well sound-proofed, but we're so high up that no one could hear us anyway.'
A door down the hall leads to a surveillance room. He walks up to a light switch near the front door and flicks the switch while leaning down and
placing his face close to it. A faint blue light scrolls over his eyes and the computers come to life. Retinal scan. Cool, very cool. Clearly, Sandor was
able to set up a high-tech security system. There are a dozen computers and even more monitors. We're tapped into every camera in the John
Hancock Center, all one hundred floors of it, plus what seems to be every camera around the city that's controlled by the Chicago Police
Department. Nine touches something on a keyboard and the largest screen in the room comes to life, showing a photo of a muscular man in a
black Italian suit, its beautiful cloth and perfect cut apparent even in the grainy picture. He has black hair and a thick beard, and he's holding two
laptops. I look at Nine, wondering why he's showing me this.
'That's Sandor,' Nine says after a minute. His voice is different. I hear less bravado. He turns to me. I hear vulnerability. 'Come on. You have a
decision to make, an important one.' He pauses for drama
