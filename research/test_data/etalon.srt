1
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:11,541
Earth. Fire.

2
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:14,711
Air. Water.

3
00:00:14,713 --> 00:00:19,049
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

4
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:21,818
and bring balance to the world.

5

<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

6
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:28,625
The Avatar has gone missing!

7
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:30,727
Three years ago, Zaheer poisoned Korra,

8
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:31,729
severely injuring her.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,031
While her friends moved
on with their lives,

10
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,499
Korra remained in the south pole.

11
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,221
Everyone thought she
was still recuperating,

12
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,470
but six months ago, Korra left
home and hasn't been seen since.

13
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:42,039
Even chief Tonraq was shocked to learn

14
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,761
that his daughter's
whereabouts are unknown.

15
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:48,021
What has become of the Avatar
and when will she return?

16
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:04,394
Hurry up in there!

17
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:07,931
Come on, I got an emergency situation!

18
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:10,300
Knock yourself out.

19
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,413
Huh?

20
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,320
You again.

21
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:43,133
Leave me alone!

22
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:44,534
What's wrong with her?

23
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:46,803
Young lady, are you all right?

24
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:49,172
Can I take you to a Doctor?

25
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:53,543
No, I don't need any help.

26
00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:59,549
Now don't take this the wrong way,

27
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:00,984
but I can't wait for you to leave.

28
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:03,920
How else is she supposed to
take that but the wrong way?

29
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:06,623
I mean because I've never
had a pen pal before.

30
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,158
I'm going to write you so many letters,

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,960
and just to get the ball rolling,

32
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,495
here. Spoiler alert.

33
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:12,662
Pabu and I already miss you.

34
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:15,899
Thanks, that's sweet. Are
you sure you don't want

35
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,934
some company in the Southern water tribe?

36
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:21,571
- I'm happy to come with
you. - No, I appreciate it,

37
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,940
but I'll only be gone a couple weeks.

38
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,542
A little time alone will be good for me.

39
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:29,579
Now I don't want you to worry
about a thing while you're gone.

40
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:32,115
Your recovery should be
your number one concern.

41
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:37,120
Jinora, the airbenders and I
have everything under control.

42
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,990
Bye, Korra! Get better soon!

43
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:41,491
Don't forget to write!

44
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:59,409
Ah!

45
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,354
Can't sleep again?

46
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:13,623
Honey, your father and
I have tried to give you

47
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,661
as much space as you've
needed, but we're worried.

48
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:20,163
You're not sleeping. You're barely eating.

49
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:23,833
We don't want to push you,
but it's been three weeks.

50
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:28,705
Will you please go see Katara?

51
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:31,841
All right. I'll go.

52
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:34,711
You're going to get through this.

53
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:37,881
Oh, I love you so much.

54
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:45,956
The poison did a lot of internal damage.

55
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,524
Can you fix it?

56
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,893
I can help guide your healing process,

57
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:53,897
but whether you get
better or not is up to you.

58
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,836
I know what it's like to go
through a traumatic experience,

59
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:01,004
and I promise you,

60
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:03,707
if you dedicate yourself to getting better,

61
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,875
you'll recover stronger than ever.

62
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:08,912
That's what I want, more than anything.

63
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:11,381
Then try something for me.

64
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:14,818
Concentrate on your big toe.

65
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,355
Visualize it moving.

66
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,889
Breathe.

67
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:30,400
Did you see that?

68
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:33,303
It worked!

69
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:37,474
The mind can be a powerful ally

70
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:39,075
or your greatest enemy.

71
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:44,414
Now, I want you to try taking a step.

72
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:51,621
Ah!

73
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,391
Ugh!

74
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:55,058
You're okay.

75
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,627
Your body thinks it's still in danger,

76
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:58,962
but you're safe here.

77
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:02,198
Use your mind to overcome the pain.

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,102
Try again. I'm done for today.

79
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:08,104
"Dear Korra, I miss you.

80
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:11,441
"It's not the same in
Republic city without you.

81
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:15,378
"How are you feeling?
Things are going well here.

82
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,546
"I just got a big contract

83
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:19,115
"to help redesign the
city's infrastructure,

84
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:22,585
so I'll be keeping pretty busy for awhile."

85
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:23,520
"Hey, Korra.

86
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,955
"So, I'm not very good at writing letters.

87
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:29,793
"It's 2:15 in the
afternoon. Weather is fair.

88
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,095
"Chance of snow showers later today.

89
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:36,499
"But enough joking around.
I hope you're doing well.

90
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:37,934
"Me? I'm back on the beat.

91
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:40,937
"Beifong has me staking
out the red monsoon hideout,

92
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:44,040
you won't believe what's going down."

93
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,675
"My dearest, Avatar Korra.

94
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:48,645
"Though several fortnights have
passed since your departure,

95
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:51,715
"to convalesce in the
homeland of your tribesmen,

96
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:56,119
"I feel our friendship knows
neither time nor distance.

97
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:57,921
"You will be most pleased to learn

98
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,203
"that I found gainful employment

99
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:01,391
"with Sir Varrick and the lady Kuvira.

100
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:04,427
"I set off on the morrow
with some trepidation,

101
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:06,830
"but I am eager to offer any aid I can

102
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:11,534
in stabilizing the Earth kingdom."

103
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:27,751
Whenever you're ready. What's the point?

104
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:29,486
We've been at this for almost six months

105
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:32,989
and I can barely take a couple
of steps without collapsing.

106
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,024
I know you're frustrated, but...

107
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:38,194
Of course I'm frustrated!
A crazy man poisoned me,

108
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:40,663
and now I can't dress
myself or cook for myself

109
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:43,733
or do anything for
myself, and this whole time

110
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:45,375
my friends have been off helping the world

111
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:50,807
while I'm stuck with you,
and you can't even heal me!

112
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:53,743
That came out wrong.

113
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:54,878
It's all right.

114
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,615
Let your anger and
frustration flow like water.

115
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:02,318
I am trying to understand
why this happened to me.

116
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,053
But nothing makes any sense.

117
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:07,724
I'm tired, Katara. I'm so tired.

118
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:11,561
Korra, I know you feel alone right now,

119
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:12,996
but you're not the first Avatar

120
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:15,432
who's had to overcome great suffering.

121
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:19,335
Can you imagine how much
pain Aang felt when he learned

122
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:23,206
that his entire culture was taken from him?

123
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,842
That must have been so awful.

124
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:28,678
But he never let it destroy his spirit.

125
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,881
He chose to find meaning in his suffering,

126
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:34,050
and eventually found peace.

127
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:38,054
And what am I gonna find
if I get through this?

128
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:45,462
I don't know, but won't it
be interesting to find out?

129
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,834
Close your eyes.

130
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:55,305
Visualize yourself walking over to Naga.

131
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,441
Can you see it? Yes.

132
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:03,646
Now, take that first step.

133
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:52,695
Where'd you come from, little cutie?

134
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,374
You can see her, too?

135
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:15,451
If you can see her, too,
maybe I'm not going crazy.

136
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:24,494
How'd you do that?

137
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:32,502
You want me to follow you?

138
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:41,344
All right, let's see what I find.

139
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,125
It's so good to see you.

140
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:59,495
How have you been, Korra. You look great.

141
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,930
I feel great. Come on.

142
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:04,767
I want to show you how
much better I'm doing.

143
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,648
Attack! I can take it.

144
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:32,595
Ah! Ah!

145
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:38,935
All right, the sparring match is over.

146
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,773
I thought I was ready.

147
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,643
There is no shame in
taking the time you need

148
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,544
to make a full recovery.

149
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:50,980
Being the Avatar can wait.

150
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,316
But what about the Earth kingdom?

151
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,084
I hear it's still a mess out there.

152
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,453
The situation has been stabilizing

153
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:58,455
since Kuvira took charge.

154
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:01,958
But that should be me out
there fixing things, not her.

155
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,028
I know you want to help, but trust me,

156
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,397
everyone has this under control.

157
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,565
I just think you need to...

158
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,767
If you say, "be patient,"

159
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,202
I swear I'm gonna
watersmack you in the mouth.

160
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:18,775
No, I was going to say you need to...

161
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:21,010
Not worry about the future.

162
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:23,212
Be grateful for where you are now

163
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:26,649
and the progress you've made.

164
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:30,853
"Dear Asami, I'm sorry I
haven't written to you sooner,

165
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:34,524
"but every time I've tried,
I never knew what to say.

166
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:37,860
"The past two years have
been the hardest of my life.

167
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:40,196
"Even though I can get around fine now,

168
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,165
"I still can't go into the Avatar state.

169
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:46,002
"I keep having visions of Zaheer
and what happened that day.

170
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:48,638
"Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head,

171
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,239
"so I've been meditating a lot,

172
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:53,776
"but sometimes I worry
I'll never fully recover.

173
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:55,678
"Please don't tell Mako and Bolin.

174
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,480
"I wrote to you and not them.

175
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,115
"I don't want to hurt their feelings,

176
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:02,085
"but it's easier to tell
you about this stuff.

177
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,787
I don't think they'd understand."

178
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:12,228
Everything all right, sweetie?

179
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,599
There's something I need to tell you both.

180
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,266
What is it?

181
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:19,068
I want to go back to Republic city.

182
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,605
Are you sure? I know I'm not 100% yet,

183
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,741
but I feel like I've hit a wall.

184
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,976
I need to be where the action is,

185
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:29,278
where my friends are.

186
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,714
I'll have the white lotus prepare a boat

187
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:34,016
and they can take you back to Republic city

188
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,551
as soon as you're ready.

189
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,153
No, I want to go alone.

190
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:39,422
And have some time to clear my head.

191
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,991
It will be good for me.

192
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,212
Two lobster crabs, please.

193
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:06,582
Why, you're the Avatar, ain't ya?

194
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,684
Yep, that's me.

195
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:09,852
I can't believe it!

196
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:14,824
Mind if I take a picture
for my wall of avatars?

197
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,859
I'm kind of in a hurry.

198
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,261
It'll only take a second.

199
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:22,198
Avatar Aang was a big fan of
my seaweed wraps, you know,

200
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,869
so I named them "Aang rolls."
Now they're my biggest seller.

201
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:30,139
And they ain't even got fish in 'em.

202
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:33,009
Now smile.

203
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,111
But if could have met any Avatar,

204
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,913
I'd have to pick Kyoshi.

205
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:39,615
Taking down a shark squid with one hand?

206
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:42,518
Now that's a lady I'd like to get to know.

207
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,054
Thieves! Get back here!

208
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:48,591
Oh, don't worry. The Avatar's right here.

209
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,860
Well, what are you waiting for?

210
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:53,796
Go get 'em!

211
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:02,438
Hand over the bags or else.

212
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,874
Ah! Ugh!

213
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:13,816
You sure she's the Avatar?

214
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:53,749
Everyone, come here! It's the Avatar!

215
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:57,954
You sure?

216
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,922
I don't sense any Raava energy around her.

217
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:02,959
Besides, she's not dressed like the Avatar.

218
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,227
Doesn't the Avatar have ponytails?

219
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:09,031
Do you mind? I'm trying
to concentrate here.

220
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,232
And, yes, I am the Avatar.

221
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:12,101
I'm just wearing different clothes

222
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,035
and I cut my hair.

223
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:16,906
See? I told you guys it was her.

224
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,975
How come you've been away so long?

225
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,876
I was hurt pretty bad awhile ago,

226
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:23,045
and lost touch with my Avatar spirit.

227
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:25,181
No wonder I couldn't feel Raava's energy.

228
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:28,617
I came to the tree of time
hoping to reconnect with Raava

229
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:31,053
and turn on the Avatar state again.

230
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:32,088
But it's not working.

231
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,825
The last time I was here
I saw all sorts of visions.

232
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,126
Now I don't see anything.

233
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:39,428
Maybe we can help you get better.

234
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,098
I'm sorry, but for years
people have been saying

235
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,667
they can help me get better.

236
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,569
Nothing's worked.

237
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:51,340
I need to figure this out on my own.

238
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,184
"Dear mom and dad,

239
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:04,820
"I arrived in Republic
city a couple weeks ago

240
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:06,255
"and couldn't be happier.

241
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:07,990
"It's nice to be back at the temple,

242
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:09,825
"and it's great to see my friends again.

243
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:12,628
"Don't worry, I'm taking it easy,

244
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,898
"but hopefully I'll be back in action soon.

245
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,034
"I miss you both very much.

246
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:21,704
"Please give Naga a big hug for me.

247
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:27,710
Love, Korra."

248
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:30,112
Raava?

249
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:32,948
Raava!

250
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:58,707
I am ending this.

251
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:28,504
Excuse me, who do I talk to
about getting in the ring?

252
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,921
Is that all you got?

253
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,000
We have a winner!

254
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:02,972
Hurry up in there!

255
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:18,013
Why did you bring me to the swamp?

256
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:25,861
Wait, I met you at the tree of time.

257
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:28,464
You should have told me who you were.

258
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:31,433
If I did, would you have followed me?

259
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:33,102
I get your point.

260
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:35,037
But why did you bring me here?

261
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,206
What am I gonna find in the swamp?

262
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:41,410
Not a what. A who.

263
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:43,746
No, wait!

264
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:46,081
Come back!

265
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:58,994
You're just in my mind.

266
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:03,098
You're not real.

267
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:19,582
Ah! Ugh!

268
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:23,586
Ahh!

269
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:02,458
Ah!

270
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:14,370
Help!

271
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,517
Feeling better?

272
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,953
Where am I? What happened?

273
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:33,656
I was hoping you could tell me.

274
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:35,658
I found you passed out in the mud.

275
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,026
How did you know I was out there?

276
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:41,063
I'm pretty tapped into
the goings-on around here.

277
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:44,099
What brings you to the swamp, anyway?

278
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:45,401
A spirit led me here

279
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:48,170
and told me I was supposed to find someone.

280
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:50,506
- Is that you?
- Beats me.

281
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:53,642
But if your Avatar senses called you here,

282
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:56,011
you should probably listen to them.

283
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:59,982
- Wait, you recognize me?
- In a manner of speaking.

284
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:04,520
We were good friends in your previous life.

285
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:11,527
I can't believe it.

286
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,096
Toph?

287
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:18,115
Nice to see you again, twinkletoes.

288
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,752
