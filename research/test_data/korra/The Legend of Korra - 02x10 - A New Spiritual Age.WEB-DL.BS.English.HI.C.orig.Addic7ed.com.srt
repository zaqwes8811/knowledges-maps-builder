I could just stay in here
forever, reading.

The last human who said that
is still here.

Professor Zei.

173
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,349
I see that you have
some knowledge of the past,

174
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:55,920
so you should know that humans

175
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:58,897
are no longer allowed
in my library.

176
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:01,169
Get out.

177
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,436
I thought anyone could come in

178
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:04,007
if they brought you
some new knowledge.

179
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,242
Those are the old rules.

180
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,181
Besides, what is a little girl

181
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:10,189
going to teach Wan Shi Tong,

182
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:13,266
he who knows 10,000 things?

183
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:15,437
Well, since you've been down
in the spirit world,

184
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:17,775
the humans have invented radio.

185
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:20,283
Yes, I am well aware
of the radio.

186
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:22,556
But do you know how it works?

187
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:24,361
Of course I do.

188
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,435
There is a box,
and inside the box,

189
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:28,106
there is a tiny man who sings

190
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:30,214
and plays musical instruments.

191
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:32,785
Actually, when we speak,

192
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:34,722
our voices produce sound waves.

193
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,458
Radio takes those sound waves

194
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,536
and converts them
into electromagnetic energy

195
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,442
that is transmitted
through the spectrum...

196
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:43,248
all right, enough.

197
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,385
I did not know this.

198
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:48,220
Apparently, I have been fed
some misinformation

199
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:51,997
about the existence of tiny men
in boxes.

200

[Dog squeaks]

201
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:57,315
Still, I'm not interested
in that human garbage.

202
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:58,653
Now go away.

203
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,593
My grandfather was the Avatar,

204
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,197
and I came to the spirit world

205
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:05,135
with the new Avatar
to find the spirit portals.

206
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,071
I would think
that you'd wanna help me.

207
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,813
You came with the Avatar, hm?

208
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:12,187
Well, why didn't you say so?

209
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:14,427
Fine, you may look around,

210
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:17,133
but don't break anything.

211
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:20,473
I'll know.

212
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:25,552
Come on, furry-foot.
We gotta hurry.

213
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:28,056
They say that the game
of Pai Sho

214
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:30,628
was invented by the spirits,

215
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,299
although some of them
don't seem

216
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:33,903
to grasp it very well.

217
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:35,875
Just hold on.

218
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:37,178
I'm thinking.

219
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,451
As you can see, it is a game

220
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:41,994
that requires great patience,

221
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:45,304
but time does not mean much
to us here.

222
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:46,841
How long have you lived here?

223
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:49,782
Oh, I've been here
for many years.

224
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:51,920
I had always enjoyed
the company

225
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:54,328
of the spirits, so when my work

226
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,035
was done in the material world,

227
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:59,873
I chose to leave my body behind

228
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,947
and come to the spirit world.

229

It can be a wonderful place,

Korra, what's wrong?

232
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:20,529
I came here with my friend,

233
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:22,265
but I lost her,

234
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,468
and now I'm all alone.

No.
It's not okay.

I did that?

In the spirit world,

your emotions become
your reality,

especially for the Avatar

253
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:11,093
because you are the bridge
between the two worlds.

254

I can make the sun shine?

Even in the material world,

260
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,607
you will find that if you look
for the light,

261

you can often find it.

00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:49,831
that is all you will ever see.

This Mountain is his home.

335
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:18,213
When you first met him,
you were frightened.

336
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:21,555
But does he seem scary
to you now?

337
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:22,623
No.

338
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,928
Many things
that seem threatening

339
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:27,635
in the dark become welcoming

340
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:30,475
when we shine a light on them.

341
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,521
It was good to meet you.

342
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:37,258
Come visit me again,

343
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,567
in this life or the next.

344
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:42,639
Bye.

345
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:46,411
Okay.
Time for you to go home.

I'm not afraid of you.

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,344
You're not scary.

353
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,949
You just look that way.

354
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:30,886
I have light inside.

355
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:34,497
It's okay.
You can be my friends.

My name is Korra, and I'm taking
this dragon-bird home.

All right,
now let's close that portal

366
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:43,496
and go find Jinora.

So you've returned, Raava.

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,431
The harmonic convergence
is coming soon,

and this time, I'm going
to wipe you out for good.

374
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:31,989
I think you've said that
before, Vaatu,

375
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:34,093
but I'm here to close
the portal.

376
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:37,335
You're not getting out.

377
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:40,612
You might want to reconsider,

378
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:44,491
that is, if you want
to save your friend.

I can't believe I trusted you.

384
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:04,910
You made me think you wanted

385
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,613
to restore balance
with the spirits.

386
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:08,184
But this, this isn't balance.

387

It's madness.

Now let her go.

If you want your friend
to make it

390
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:14,167
out of the spirit world,
you'll open

391
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:16,241
the other portal now.

392
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:19,551

Open the portal,

397
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:32,355
or lose your friend's
soul forever?

Ah!

405
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:36,689
You should have come
through the portal.

406
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:38,158
Then you could do this.

to close the portal?

I'm sorry.

she waking up?

What happened
to my little girl?
