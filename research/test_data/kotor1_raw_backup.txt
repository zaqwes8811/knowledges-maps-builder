221 := Recommended
222 := Strength measures physical power. A high Strength adds modifiers to melee damage and chance to hit, which is important for characters that use close-combat weapons (vibroblades, lightsabers).
223 := Dexterity measures agility and reflexes. A high Dexterity adds modifiers to ranged attack rolls (blasters, grenades) and increases a character's Defense rating, making them harder to hit.
224 := Constitution represents health and resiliency. A high Constitution adds modifiers to the vitality points gained at each level-up. This is important for everyone, but essential for soldiers and Jedi guardians.
225 := Wisdom represents willpower and perception. A high Wisdom adds modifiers to Jedi Force Points and Force Power saving throws. The Force Powers of a Jedi with high Wisdom are also much harder to resist.
226 := Intelligence represents knowledge and reasoning. A high Intelligence adds modifiers to the number of points a character has to spend on essential skills.
227 := Charisma represents personality and the ability to lead. A high Charisma adds modifiers to Force-related feats and powers that are very important to all the Jedi classes. It is also central to any persuasive talker.

241 := Quick Help Text: If you select this option, your character will use an optimized template. You will only have to choose your character's appearance and decide on a name.
242 := Custom Help Text: Select this option to customize every aspect of your character. You will choose attribute, skill and feat allocation, as well as appearance and name.
243 := Computer Use
244 := Related Attribute: Intelligence

Computer Use allows a character to slice computer programs using disposable logic rams called computer spikes. A character might disable gun turrets or flood a patrol area, with more complicated tasks requiring more spikes. A high rank in this skill reduces the number of spikes required by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for every 4 points total, including attribute score modifiers.
245 := Demolitions
246 := Related Attribute: Intelligence

Demolitions can be used to set, recover or disarm mines. Such devices are either of low (DC15 to set), medium (DC20 to set), or high difficulty (DC25 to set). Attempting to disarm the mine adds +5 to the DC. Attempting to recover the mine adds +10 to the DC. This skill cannot be used untrained.
247 := Stealth
248 := Related Attribute: Dexterity

Stealth governs the use of camouflage devices to enter Stealth Mode. If a character equips such a device and activates Stealth Mode, opponents must make an Awareness check versus the character's Stealth skill or be unable to detect them, even if the character is in a direct line of sight. A character in Stealth Mode can set, disable, and recover mines, use computers and repair droids, and open doors or containers. Party members will not automatically enter combat while in this mode. Combat cancels Stealth Mode. Stealth Mode will not work without a camouflage unit. Units of higher quality grant a bonus to the skill.
249 := Awareness
250 := Related Attribute: Wisdom

Awareness governs the ability of a character to spot objects or enemies hidden by Stealth. If a successful check of this skill is made against the Stealth skill of an enemy or the DC of a mine, the enemy or object is noticed and becomes visible. Awareness is always active, but results are best while a character is moving slowly. Running imparts a -5 penalty to any checks of the skill.
251 := Persuade
252 := Related Attribute: Charisma

Only the main player character can select this skill during level-up.
Persuade options appear in dialogue when interesting or sensitive information is available that a character might otherwise be reluctant to reveal. When selected, rank in this skill is compared with how extreme the request is (Difficulty Class low, medium, or high, relative to player level). A guard might easily agree to increase a bounty, but convincing him to leave his post would be much harder.
253 := Repair
254 := Related Attribute: Intelligence

Repair allows a character to fix disabled mechanical devices like droids using disposable packages of parts. The number of part kits required increases with the difficulty of the repair. This skill reduces the number of parts required by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for every 4 points total, including attribute score modifiers. This skill also modifies the amount of vitality points recovered when party member droids use repair kits, advanced repair kits, and construction kits on themselves to repair combat damage.
255 := Security
256 := Related Attribute: Wisdom

Security is used to access electronic locking devices. Once a character invests points in this skill, it becomes one of the default options on targeted doors and containers. Security spikes can grant a bonus to the skill, and any in inventory will also appear as a default option on targeted doors and containers. Characters with no points invested cannot attempt to use this skill.
257 := Treat Injury
258 := Related Attribute: Wisdom

Treat Injury improves the amount of damage healed when a medpac is used, adding the modified rank to the number of vitality points healed. Advanced medpacs and life support packs apply multipliers to the user's skill, increasing the amount healed again.

1615 := How did you get down here?
1616 := I wish I could help you with that.
1617 := I am confident that you can deal with that on your own.
1618 := How can I help?
1619 := Then I suggest we move on.
1620 := Yes, I promised you an answer when we reached the Ebon Hawk, didn't I? But I'm afraid you won't like it. We should have some privacy for this.
1621 := I've given it considerable thought. I tried to master my emotions, rule out anything that would upset the careful balance I've spent years of training developing... but it's no use.
1622 := You're stronger than I am, and there's no point in telling me otherwise. You will be a great Jedi, I think. I hope.
1623 := I can't deny that there are parts of you I am drawn to. Your power, your will. You are so much stronger than I am.
1624 := In some ways you make me feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. But at the same time, you make me feel stronger, more alive.
1625 := Your guess is as good as mine. I know I'm not going to stop fighting against Malak and against the dark side.
1626 := I don't know. I have no experience in this sort of thing... and, really, this isn't the sort of time for... anything to happen, is it?
1627 := I realize now these feelings are part of the bond we share. The Jedi Council surely realized this; they knew my loyalty to the doctrines of our Order would be tested on this mission.
1628 := By facing and overcoming my feelings for you I have learned a valuable lesson about control and the dangers of emotion. This is an important step in understanding the Force.
1629 := I'm sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear. But I felt it was important you know our... infatuation... was nothing more than a result of our powerful bond.
1630 := Please, don't say it like that. You make it sound like I was using you! Don't you realize how difficult this was for me?
1631 := I... suppose you're right. If.. if all this fails because of me, I just... I don't think I could bear it.
1632 := Let's get on with this. I want to find Malak... I want this to end as soon as possible. Whatever lies between us we can... we can work out then.
1633 := Good. If... if we didn't stop Malak, and it was my fault... I don't think I could bear it.
1634 := You have been patient with me, haven't you? I suppose you deserve an answer. But you have to understand how difficult this is for me to say.
1635 := *sigh*... it's just...
1636 := It's just... this is wrong! I am supposed to *know* better!
1637 := With all my training, I should be able to control myself better than this. But you're not anything like I expected. You're not like any man I've ever met before.
1638 := I find myself watching you when I don't mean to. I'm thinking about you when I don't want to. It isn't supposed to be like this!
1639 := Well you're going to. I cannot keep this to myself any longer, no matter how unpleasant you might find it.
1640 := I don't know. It shouldn't be so hard to not think of you. It should be easy to not think of you. I should have discipline! Jedi discipline!
1641 := Every time I try to call on all my teachings to calm myself, they fail me. You have such power, such passion! I don't know if it's due to the bond between us, but I'm drawn to you. 
1642 := You... good. That is good. That... makes it easier for me. I would prefer to think of you as a disgusting, horrid man than... anything else.
1643 := It would be better if I could leave, return to Dantooine or... go anywhere other than here and put this behind me. But I can't. Malak must be stopped.
1644 := Don't worry - I can put this behind me. Let's just continue on with what we must do. It is better this way.
1645 := Oh, I thought... No, this is good. I'm glad you told me. This makes everything much easier.
1646 := I... *laugh*! No! Damn you for making me laugh! This... this is serious!
1647 := The Force is a part of you, as is your power. But that's not what attracted me to you. It's more than that. Maybe it's the bond we share. It gives us a certain... intimacy.
1648 := If I could, I would return to Dantooine. I need to be away from this bond of ours. I need to weaken it. I need to be anywhere but near you!
1649 := But I can't. Malak must be stopped, no matter what.
1650 := That... that's good. That makes this easier. I still feel a fool for acting like this, but knowing there is nothing...
1651 := And go where? I am needed here, just as you are. There is nothing that is more important than what we are doing. Which is why we need to resolve this.
1652 := I wonder... if this is a result of our bond? Or pehaps this was meant to be? I just know that I can't control what I'm feeling.
1653 := Please, don't tell anyone. I can... try to work through this, if I must. I just... I need to know if you feel anything. For me.
1654 := I... see. I don't know how to feel about that.
1655 := In a way, I feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. I also feel stronger, more alive... I've never felt anything like it.
1656 := I shall have to think on this. I am... sorry for bringing this all up so suddenly. This is not exactly the best of times for such talk, is it?
1657 := But, then, if all this had never happened... never mind. Let us continue doing what we came here for.
1658 := Good. We have more than enough to occupy ourselves, I am sure.
1659 := Yes, I did end that quite abruptly, didn't I? Perhaps a Master could have addressed my questions with the proper wisdom. But I never should have brought it up here. Not with you.
1660 := I don't think I'm the proper Jedi to guide you. I am no Master. You should have remained with the Council.
1661 := Please don't make light of this. The very fact that I am plagued by this doubt is yet further evidence of my inadequacy.
1662 := Perhaps you are not being truly objective, then. There is no need to spare my feelings on this point.
1663 := The fact of the matter is that I have never possessed much skill at controlling myself. With the bond that joins us, it seems I have even less.
1664 := If it were not for my Battle Meditation, I would still be in training... and we, no doubt, would not even have met.
1665 := You have maintained the path of the light side. But it has been in spite of my influence, not because of it. It is increasingly obvious I am unable to guide you properly.
1666 := Fair enough. You will probably be better off on your own, in any case. I won't trouble you with this anymore.
1667 := I will attend to my own issues, and you... you are on your own.
1668 := That is kind of you to say, but I think the evidence speaks for itself. I think... I think I may have made a very big mistake.
1669 := I don't know. I think... I think I may have made a very big mistake.
1670 := I simply hope that you are not the one who pays the price, ultimately, for the fact that I can't help you enough.
1671 := That's a kinder response than I deserve. And I can see there is wisdom in your words.
1672 := Perhaps you can help me. And I will try to help you, if I can. Hopefully this will all work out, for the both of us. And for the sake of the mission.
1673 := You... you continue to be there for me, don't you? Even after I keep pushing you away, you're still around when I need you most.
1674 := Well, just... different, I suppose. Things are not going as I thought they would. I... I need time to think about all this. 
1675 := And that's probably for the best, isn't it? Unfortunately we must continue this mission whether we like it or not.
1676 := Whether you will continue on your current path and fall to the dark side, I don't know. But it is increasingly obvious I am unable to guide you properly.
1677 := Am I so transparent? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, considering our bond. Yes, there is something I would like to ask, if you'll permit it.
1678 := In our time together I've been watching you. You are a true servant of the light, you follow the tenets of the Jedi Order despite the lure of the dark side. And with so little training.
1679 := For me it has always been a constant battle. Don't you find it difficult at all? You make it seem so easy. Or is that only an illusion?
1680 := You don't? Sometimes I find that it is nearly all I can think of. I have never found the Jedi training easy to master.
1681 := I've always struggled for control over my passions. I've always been too quick to anger, too quick to get involved. My instructors constantly berated me for it.
1682 := I've often dreamed that I might be able to confront Darth Malak myself. I dream I can use all this power I have to kill him and stop all the death and destruction.
1683 := I just think about all the evil that the Sith have caused and I... I get so furious. Yet we are told that these feelings are the path to the dark side.
1684 := I suppose I do. Part of me thinks that it would be worth anything to vanquish evil, even if it meant giving in to my base emotions.
1685 := The very thought that I could become as evil as Malak; I just can't fathom it. It just doesn't seem possible. How could I... no, wait. I'm sorry.
1686 := I shouldn't even be asking you this. The Jedi teachings are clear; who am I to question them? And even worse, who am I to try and make you question them?
1687 := These are dangerous thoughts, the indulgence of a vain mind. Please, forget I ever mentioned this. Let's just return to our mission.
1688 := But what comes next? After using all that power, would you decide to impose your own view on the universe? The dark side corrupts your very thoughts.
1689 := I don't know. Would the power I used to kill Darth Malak be too tempting to keep using? Would I become the kind of evil I want to destroy?
1690 := That's a relief to hear. I have never found the Jedi path an easy one to walk, and it's good to know I'm not alone.
1691 := And that's enough for you? If only it were as easy for me. If only the right path was always clear.
1692 := In our time together I've been watching you. I've seen your tendency towards giving in to your darker emotions. You do as you please, for the most part.
1693 := Don't worry, this isn't a lead-up to a lecture. I'm... fascinated by your passion, by how easily it comes to you.
1694 := You seem to do whatever you want, something I would never dare consider. Don't you fear the consequences?
1695 := That... that's a relief to hear. That you would even be willing to risk so much is... is very brave. Braver than I could be.
1696 := Is it? The thought of what could happen to me if I lose control... somehow I think life could be very long, indeed.
1697 := I doubt my old Master would approve of your advice. Besides, I'm not like you. I must always be on guard against such outbursts.
1698 := Don't even start with that. You're the one who asked. I wasn't even going to say anything. But now that you've brought it up, I see I shouldn't have waited as long as I have.
1699 := I do. I have been trying to come up with the best way to say this for some time, but I suppose I should just come out and say it.
1700 := The truth is, I have come to depend on you. Not just for the sake of the mission, but for my own sake as well. I am... I am glad you are with us.
1701 := Did I? I am trying to be sincere, here. It occurred to me that I may have been too critical of you. Too demanding, at times.
1702 := I know my manner can be a bit taciturn. I know you must be getting sick of my lectures about the dark side and... and everything else.
1703 := I spent all my years being hounded by my instructors. Being told so often how gifted and important I was until I was sick of it.
1704 := I remember when I was younger I used to swear that I would never become as self-absorbed and stodgy as the Jedi Masters. It's ironic, really.
1705 := Yes, well... there's no need for you to agree so whole-heartedly.
1706 := Being controlled has kept everyone around me at an arm's length; even those like yourself who are most in need of my understanding and compassion.
1707 := But maybe it's time to change that. You deserve to know how much I respect and admire you. I thought... I just thought I should tell you.
1708 := Well, that was not nearly so difficult as I feared. Thank you for hearing me out. I feel... I feel much better.
1709 := I suppose not. But I am becoming like that, though it's not easy for me to admit.
1710 := That's kind of you to say, but I know for myself that it's not really true.
1711 := I see. Is there nothing I can do to make it up to you? I would rather we were friends.
1712 := I... you know I can't feel that way about you. About any man. It isn't permitted. I am a Jedi, I must resist these temptations.
1713 := But I still want to consider you a friend. We could... we could never be anything more, though. That... that isn't allowed.
1714 := What? But I... alright. Have it your way, if that's what you'd prefer. We needn't talk further.
1715 := I am trying my best. You are not making this easy for me, you know.
1716 := Now you're teasing me. You know very well what I said.
1717 := Well, yes. Surely that is not so surprising.
1718 := No, I'm not. Why must you make this so difficult for me? Can't you just accept a simple compliment?
1719 := Why? I could not accomplish this on my own, I need the aid of others - especially one who is strong in the Force. The bond between us made you a natural choice.
1720 := I admit, there were times that I wondered if this is more than just a mission to stop Malak. There were times when I wondered if this was also a way for the Council to test my own abilities.
1721 := You must learn to trust in the wisdom of the Council. Your destiny will come in its appointed time. You mustn't be so impatient.
1722 := Only a question? Meaning I should ignore the subtle accusations in your questions?
1723 := *Must* you be so frustrating? I admit, I had a moment of foolish pride. But I'm over it. Now I am focused on my true responsibilities.
1724 := I am simply trying to help you and complete this mission, and yet you battle me at every turn!
1725 := I started it? You were the one who brought up the issue of the Council! You were the one who questioned our mission! You're the one who mocked me for thinking I was being tested!
1726 := Perhaps the Council is relying a lot on our bond and my visions. Perhaps they are desperate. Does that make you feel better, knowing that?
1727 := Fun?! Fun?! Driving me insane is your idea of a good time?
1728 := I must admit: I simply don't know how to deal with someone like you.
1729 := You... you are a very odd man, do you know that? I simply don't know how to deal with you. All I want to do is help you, but you seem determined to drive me mad.
1730 := Oh, if only it were that easy...
1731 := I don't know if I should be outraged that you keep joking about serious matters, or if I should be grateful that you can always lighten the mood.
1732 := Unfortunately it isn't as easy as that. But your point is well taken.
1733 := Come on, come, let's move on... there's much to be done.
1734 := I do. I've been watching you. Studying you closely to see what kind of progress you have made since your training at the hands of Master Zhar.
1735 := I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occasions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.
1736 := Regardless, it is not too late for that to change. You must continue to work on your control, lest the dark side overwhelm you.
1737 := You need to see what the dark side represents in its entirety, for it is what we battle. Only the wisdom of a Jedi Master can truly explain this, but I will do my best to make you understand.
1738 := The dark side is not simply giving in to anger or temptation to use the Force to destructive ends. These things only lead to the dark side.
1739 := The dark side grows stronger and more insidious the closer you draw to it. It begs you to surrender to it, to release all its terrible power... and it becomes harder and harder to resist.
1740 := And once you stop resisting, it is too late. It twists you up inside and... and turns you into a mockery of everything you once stood for.
1741 := You say you understand, but I'm afraid you are taking this too lightly. The power of the dark side can be... alluring.
1742 := We need only to look at the atrocities which have been committed by those under its sway to understand the terrible, corrupting evil of the dark side.
1743 := Millions dead, and far more suffering. What sort of person would you have to become to perform such deeds gladly?
1744 := And that is why the dark side is so insidious. If you are not careful, you do not even see each small step you take towards it until it is too late.
1745 := It is so easy to think that we would never fall prey to such a horror; that we have unlimited control, vigilance and foresight. If only that were true.
1746 := The Sith have become powerful because there are many Jedi who have succumbed to the lure of the dark side and joined their cause.
1747 := What greater weapon is there than to turn an enemy to your cause? To use their own knowledge against them?
1748 := We are weakened while they are strengthened. So we must harden our hearts and do whatever is required to fight against the dark side. Even when the battle becomes wearying.
1749 := No, I suppose not. I have spoken more than enough of the dark side. It is up to you whether you heed my words or not.
1750 := I don't know. The vision of our future is clouded by shadows cast from the dark side. But I sense something ominous lurking in those shadows.
1751 := But words alone cannot save one from the dark side. Come, we should continue with the task at hand. When the time comes I only hope we are all strong enough to do what we must.
1752 := And how adept must one become at making excuses for one's actions, if suffering is the result? How long before you stop making excuses at all?
1753 := Neither do I, and I hope I never do.
1754 := One who serves the light side does not strike down an innocent. We take arms against the dark side and the injustice that follows it only.
1755 := I am no less resistant to temptation than any other. I simply have the benefit of training that you do not. But even the training of the Jedi might not be enough to save us.
1756 := I know as much as any other Jedi because I face it every day. It is vital that you understand what the dark side represents, for it is what we must battle.
1757 := We must, for all our sakes. If you had the proper training under a true Master you would know all this. But because of our mission, I must be the one to try and help you understand.
1758 := I've seen how you have resisted many temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable, but I'm afraid you might stray from this path.
1759 := Yes, I suppose I can understand your curiosity, given the bond that connects us. Very well, I'll tell you a bit about myself.
1760 := Did you not know this? I have gone through most of the training that a regular Jedi would. I have simply not completed the final tests.
1761 := The Battle Meditation ability I possess is a rare and powerful one, however... and it was sorely needed enough that my training was interrupted.
1762 := I have never lied. Regardless, the fact remains that I have received considerably more training than you.
1763 := I was found to be strong with the Force at a young age, as most Padawans are. As a girl I was given to the Order to be trained.
1764 := When I joined the Order I left my family on Talravin, as all Padawans do. My family is still there, the last that I heard. I have had little contact with them, as it is discouraged.
1765 := Relationships with family members are fraught with powerful emotions. Such extremes are to be avoided. Anger and hate are the worst, but even love can lead to folly.
1766 := Like all who join the Order, I have learned to embrace the life I have chosen. I had to let go of my attachments to my family.
1767 := It can be a hard lesson to learn. I was not on good terms with all of my family, but I do remember missing my father terribly for a very long time.
1768 := You were the one who asked to know more about me! Very well, if you have changed your mind then I suppose we should just get back to our mission.
1769 := A child is too young to understand the sacrifices that must be made. It is better if they have no contact with their family once they are removed.
1770 := Not all Jedi follow that policy. Some even take husbands or wives and enjoy the love they have. Most often that is not the case.
1771 := Once I was older I realized the wisdom of this policy. A Jedi must do what is needed, personal desires notwithstanding. Love can only obscure and confuse the matter.
1772 := You do not understand. Some sacrifices are... harder than others.
1773 := Even a Jedi cannot always control the feelings of the heart. We must do our best to guard against it, no matter what the cost. But some sacrifices are harder than others.
1774 := Some sacrifices are... harder than others.
1775 := I... I do not wish to discuss this anymore. I would rather return to our mission.
1776 := Very close. I was only a little girl when I left my family, but I still remember him fondly. He was kind and gentle and doted on me. My mother, however, was different.
1777 := I was not on good terms with my mother. I was only a little girl when I left, but I was old enough to resent her and the way she treated my father.
1778 := She pushed my father into treasure hunting. I spent all my young life on ships traveling from one false lead to the next.
1779 := She whittled away my father's entire fortune, and I hated her for it. I think she was relieved to give me to the Jedi, but my father was heartbroken.
1780 := The gift of the Force comes with a high cost. Sacrifice of one's emotional attachments is one of the prices a Jedi must be willing to pay. The alternative is to fall prey to the dark side.
1781 := Please, you mustn't say things like that. The dark side is destruction and chaos, the opposite of all that gives the universe order and purpose. You have to understand this.
1782 := And you need to be more mindful of your responsibilities! Have you any idea of the danger a fallen Jedi represents? Not only to yourself, but to others as well?
1783 := Oh, yes, because you know your way so well, do you? Let us speak no more, then, since you are so independent.
1784 := That is something every Jedi should be afraid of. 
1785 := Emotional entanglements can be dangerous. They can impair rational thought, they can lead to outbursts of uncontrolled emotion. A Jedi must be above such things.
1786 := Yes, I did. I wanted to speak to you about our mission. About what lies ahead for us. It seems fate, or the Force, is driving us into a confrontation with the Dark Lord.
1787 := There is no need to be angry. Some would believe that I have not been cautious enough, considering your natural power and lack of training.
1788 := Meaning that it is more important that we work together. You were, after all, accepted by the Jedi Council.
1789 := I should not have been so quick to underestimate you. You are neither unskilled nor a novice... you are a talented individual who has proven to be both skilled and resourceful.
1790 := I focused exclusively on matters that you have little control over, and that was a mistake. I believe your presence here is important.
1791 := As you say. You said you had a question for me?
1792 := I... would rather not discuss that, at the moment. Perhaps another time.
1793 := No... wait. Forgive me. This is difficult for me, but there is something you have to hear.
1794 := You must prepare yourself for when we face Malak. The confrontation will be difficult for you. I remember how hard it was when I first faced Revan.
1795 := Such as?
1796 := It's true that, due to my Battle Meditation, I was with the Jedi strike team that boarded Revan's ship. We did not kill Revan, however.
1797 := Our mission was to capture Revan, if possible. It was Malak who turned on his own master, firing upon Revan's ship while we were still on board it.
1798 := It was his desire to kill us and his master both. Thankfully we narrowly escaped the vessel as it exploded.
1799 := True, I suppose. And yet the outcome of that battle was... unexpected. To all of us. Revan's end was... unforeseen.
1800 := As I said, we were there to capture Revan alive. The Jedi do not believe in killing their prisoners. No one deserves execution, no matter what their crimes.
1801 := Remember that Revan and Malak were once great Jedi. Heroes in every sense of the word. They demonstrate the danger of the dark side to us all.
1802 := I'm sorry. We really shouldn't speak of this anymore. The memory of my confrontation with Revan is... painful. Let's return to the mission, please.
1803 := I have had time to ponder my actions. I am often quick to judge... a fault my master points out frequently.
1804 := It was a simple apology, that's all. You said you had a question for me?
1805 := I do. How did you know?
1806 := You may attempt to be humurous, if you wish, but the matter is a serious one.
1807 := I am a Jedi. I am far too disciplined to betray my emotions with outward physical displays. We both know the real reason you have some idea of what I am thinking: the bond we share.
1808 := A... a kinrath pup?! It most certainly is not!
1809 := I am a Jedi, remember? I have far too much mental discipline to reveal what goes on inside my mind with such obvious physical clues.
1810 := I see. I, myself, have little trouble sensing your strength with the Force through our bond.
1811 := Why do you still try to deny the existence of this bond between us? Like it or not, we are linked... as our shared vision of the Star Map proved.
1812 := Our connection allows us glimpses into each other's mind. We can feel some of what the other feels. And what I feel within you troubles me.
1813 := A Padawan must receive considerable training. They must learn to control their emotions and darker impulses. Often it takes years before using the Force can be considered safe.
1814 := The fact that you are so strong in the Force and have had such relatively little training could have terrible consequences. For you, and for everyone around you.
1815 := I don't think there is much you can do. If things were different I would recommend several years of training under one of the Jedi Masters. But I fear that won't be possible.
1816 := Thankfully you have exhibited a degree of compassion and self-control up to this point. I sincerely hope you can maintain these traits in the future.
1817 := We must all resist the influence of the dark side! It is everything we are fighting against! This is doubly important for you, with your natural affinity for the Force!
1818 := That is good to hear. Without the proper training, however, I'm afraid you will find the path difficult even with the best of intentions. There is great danger ahead, for both of us.
1819 := Our destinies are intertwined. Everything one of us does will have consequences for the other. Any reckless behavior on your part is likely to affect me as well.
1820 := I believe you truly mean what you say. For now. But sometimes it is not so easy to keep such promises.
1821 := Your power could be a gift or a curse. When you need guidance, or advice, or support I will do my best to help you stay on the path of the light.
1822 := No, of course not. Not yet. But there will be challenges ahead that might make it otherwise.
1823 := Yes, that is true. I will do my best to guide you, but I am no Master. Not yet. And there are times when I find the sheer strength of your power almost overwhelming.
1824 := That's not true. I am worried about myself, but also about you. I would rather see neither of us come to any harm.
1825 := I am not trying to harass you. But you must understand the trials and perils that lie ahead. For you, and for me.
1826 := I'm sorry if I come across as harsh. But I am concerned. For you, for our mission. And for myself, as well.
1827 := Already you exhibit the kind of willfullness, erratic behavior and lack of compassion that will lead you to corruption.
1828 := No? Self-control is a maxim for all Jedi. It is what gives us the strength to resist the dark side. All who have fallen from our Order have shown a flagrant disregard for such control.
1829 := This is not a joke! The choices you make could affect both our destinies, not to mention the fate of the Republic and the entire galaxy! There is much at stake.
1830 := No, not bothering me. Not exactly. I've been thinking about what the Jedi Council said about the two of us. 
1831 := There is a bond between us, I do not dispute that. I can feel it, as I'm sure you can. The nature of that bond and its effect on our mission remain in question.
1832 := Our fates are strongly connected; so connected that a literal bond has been forged between us.
1833 := I saw your service records when you were transferred aboard the Endar Spire, but nothing beyond that. I know very little about you. I'd like to ask you some questions, given our relationship. 
1834 := I was referring to the bond we share; the one the Jedi Council spoke of. If I actually was interested in you, rest assured I could come up with a better approach than this!
1835 := Your records spoke of your skills only... nothing of you. If we are to share this bond, I would like to know more. Would you... answer some questions?
1836 := Just a few questions about your background. Nothing intrusive, I assure you.
1837 := Why would you refuse to answer? These are simple questions, nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?
1838 := I see. I didn't mean to upset you, but I suppose it was inevitable. You've had a lot to absorb since we escaped Taris. I apologize.
1839 := Good. First, what sort of background do you have?
1840 := I see you intend to be childish about this. I guess I won't get anywhere continuing our discussion right now, will I?
1841 := Good. On which planet were you born?
1842 := Excellent. Your current age is?
1843 := Yes, well... The truth is I was studying *how* you responded to my questions. Your reactions help me judge you; this was a test for me to learn more about your character.
1844 := You were honest, which is good. And you treated this as a serious matter, which it is. This bond we share will shape both our destinies, it is not to be taken lightly.
1845 := Would you prefer it if I did?
1846 := Then I would hope a polite request would be enough to acquire co-operation.
1847 := You needn't be obstinate. I merely intend to ask some questions about your background, nothing intrusive.
1848 := There is no need to get upset over the matter. You could just as easily have been transferred aboard any other ship in the fleet, correct?
1849 := The fact that you were aboard the Endar Spire and survived the space battle should be a relief, I would think. Now, about my questions...
1850 := The crew was competent enough without meddling from the Jedi, Bastila, I'm quite sure.
1851 := Yet had I not done so, you would have had no assistance on Taris. Consider that.
1852 := Deny it if you will, but there is a connection between us. I understand why you would find this disturbing. I have my own reservations about it, to be honest.
1853 := Necessary, perhaps, but it is no guarantee of our success. I admit, I'm a little disturbed that such a bond could be possible in the first place.
1854 := I am not looking at you in any fashion.
1855 := As you wish. I am curious about something, however, and perhaps you can clarify the matter for me.
1856 := Very well. I have been curious about something, and perhaps you can clarify the matter for me.
1857 := You needn't be snide about it. Since you bring the matter up, I have been curious about something.
1858 := I would like to know what happened after you crashed on Taris. I'm curious as to what you and Carth were doing before we all joined forces.
1859 := Because I wish to know what happened. Why do you require another reason?
1860 := Whether you like my questions or not is irrelevant. You will answer.
1861 := I am not the one who is being 'touchy', now, am I? Answer the question.
1862 := Yes, I realize that of course. But surely there was more to it than a simple search. I doubt there were flashing signs pointing you in my direction; yet somehow you found me.
1863 := Yes... well. I hardly consider myself a damsel in distress. I'm a member of the Jedi Order, after all. But I won't deny you've impressed me with what you've done.
1864 := When you were chosen to join this mission, I doubt any of us expected this much from you. A Jedi could have done such things, of course. But only by drawing heavily upon the Force.
1865 := You... will?
1866 := I... of course not. Perhaps my questions are not necessary after all. It seems, however, that I shall have to keep a very close eye on you. A *very* close eye.
1867 := Maintain your cavalier attitude if you wish. This mission is too important to be left to chance.
1868 := You are reading too much into this. I simply refuse to leave anything about this mission to chance.
1869 := My 'problem' is none of your concern. I simply do not desire to leave anything about this mission to chance.
1870 := We shall continue this discussion later, perhaps. For now, let us continue with the task before us.
1871 := I see. You intend to be difficult, then, do you?
1872 := Very well. I shall be forced to keep a very close eye on you, then. A *very* close eye.
1873 := I am in command of this mission, according to the Jedi Council. Will you answer or not?
1874 := I don't think an interrogation is required, here. Nobody asked to be stranded on Taris or be forced into helping you, Bastila.
1875 := I don't remember asking for your opinion on this matter, Carth.
1876 := Hmph. Seems to me that maybe some Jedi princesses could use more time in captivity to improve their perspective.
1877 := Your objection is noted, Carth, but I still require answers... and I shall get them.
1878 := I managed to free myself, as I recall. In fact, if I hadn't been there Brejik and his thugs might have killed you in that fight. It's probably more accurate to say that I rescued you.
1879 := I escaped during the battle, which would have happened regardless. I also aided you during that fight, although I have no need to constantly remind you of it.
1880 := I'll admit that I probably wouldn't have been able to free myself if not for the brawl after the swoop race. I guess I should thank you for that, at least.
1881 := It is pointless to argue the matter. I still wish to know what happened before that incident.
1882 := It was less of a dream and more of a vision... a vision the two of us shared. But I am certainly willing to answer any questions the Jedi Council did not.
1883 := As you wish. We really should return our thoughts to business, anyway.
1884 := With luck we will.
1885 := I would rather not rely on such visions to guide us, but when we have so little else to go on and the galaxy hangs in the balance...
1886 := And are you so certain that it is not you in my dreams?
1887 := Regardless of which it is, our fates are linked... the vision was doubtless meant for us both.
1888 := I see. That is most likely vanity speaking, for I am not certain, myself. Regardless, our fates are linked... the vision was no doubt meant for us both.
1889 := I have no idea. It was obviously important, however. That is why we must investigate this further.
1890 := Perhaps because we desired to. Perhaps because they came to this planet and were strong enough in the Force to leave a... a trace.
1891 := And what else should we dream about except that which is most important to our fate?
1892 := They did something important here, of that I am certain. It may be simply that we are sensitive to that event. Or it may not.
1893 := That would not be my first choice, either, but choice appears to be irrelevant in this matter.
1894 := We dreamed about Revan and Malak either because we were meant to or because we needed to. There is no other way to look at it.
1895 := Are you wondering why we shared the vision? Or why we even received it in the first place?
1896 := To the first I can only repeat the answer that the Council gave us. Our fates are linked, and for two as strong as we are in the Force that amounts to a near-physical bond.
1897 := As to the second, I don't truly have an answer for you. The Force works as it will, and perhaps we should be grateful for what we have been given.
1898 := I... I don't know. Believe me, I certainly don't find the prospect of being joined to you enjoyable in any fashion.
1899 := The Force often seems to cause events that bend the laws of probability, especially with those that are strongly affiliated with it.
1900 := In this respect, you and I will simply have to become accustomed to such 'convienience'. We are the tools of the Force and we will do as it wills.
1901 := There is no evidence one way or the other. What you believe the Force to be ultimately will decide who you are.
1902 := What would you like to know?
1903 := Quite the contrary. Ours is the ultimate free will. The Force is our destiny, but the choices we make along it are ultimately our own.
1904 := The Force does not compel obedience. You have a destiny, but the choices you make along it are ultimately your own.
1905 := Then perhaps the sooner we see to our destiny the sooner that we can proceed on our separate paths. That seems the logical solution, no?
1906 := Please forgive me. I did not mean to imply that you were repulsive in any sense of the word. That we shared something so personal is just not something I'm used to.
1907 := Yes, but I don't feel any better. After all my training, I would have thought myself above such anger.
1908 := For it to come so easily disturbs me greatly. I don't need a holocron to remember my father, and I will never see Mother again.
1909 := Have I learned nothing? It... no, I don't want to talk about this. Thank you, but I must think about what I have done.
1910 := Yes. That brought me a lot of peace. More than I thought it would have.
1911 := Thank you for urging me towards it. After all my training, I would have thought it would have been easier. Apparently I still have much to learn.
1912 := I can try. What would you like me to recall?
1913 := I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...
1914 := I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...
1915 := I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...
1916 := I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...
1917 := There's nothing I could say that would be helpful, I'm afraid.
1918 := Korriban is a sparsely populated planet controlled by the Sith. It feels... wrong. There is an old evil here that permeates the Force.
1919 := Kashyyyk is a planet where most of what you see is actually foliage that has grown to enormous heights. No one has ever been to the true surface of the planet below.
1920 := Tatooine is a dry planet that has not been inhabited long and has little law. This town of Anchorhead may be its only settlement.
1921 := Manaan is a water world inhabited by an aquatic race known as the Selkath. Their only surface city and spaceport is called Ahto.
1922 := It is unique in that the Selkath are firm in their neutrality. They are neither part of the republic nor controlled by the Sith, and they wish to keep it that way.
1923 := Dantooine is a peaceful and pastoral planet. There are few large communities. Mostly what you will find here are ranchers and farmers.
1924 := I find it a tranquil place like few in the galaxy. The perfect site for the Jedi enclave. You will like it here.
1925 := The surface of Taris is covered with an urban skyscrape. Its glittering spires belie the decay that lies in its lower reaches, however.
1926 := Beyond that, there is little else I can tell you.
1927 := How can I help?
1928 := Hmm? Sorry, I am just thinking about my mother. It is strange to hear news after all this time. It is quite distracting.
1929 := Should we have the opportunity, I would like to find her on Tatooine. There is only one small colony there; it should not be difficult.
1930 := It's not that I look forward to seeing her, I just can't help but wonder what she wants. But... perhaps we have better things to do.
1931 := How can I help?
1932 := About my mother? I am unsure. I seem to find it difficult to remain objective when it comes to her. I find that... disturbing.
1933 := You're probably right. There are more important things to do. Mother can wait.
1934 := I told you that my mother and I never got along. Obviously that has not changed.
1935 := And now Father is dead. That... leaves a hurt inside, you just can't imagine. I haven't seen him in so long...
1936 := I have my doubts as to whether she's actually sick.
1937 := Mother used to lie about many things to get her way. She is a selfish woman who pushed my father into doing what she wished.
1938 := Yes, I... thought I had let go of that anger. All my training, and it comes back so quickly...
1939 := I don't want to talk about this any more. Let's... keep going.
1940 := Do you think I should?
1941 := I find myself agreeing with you, but I don't like how that feels.
1942 := I'll think about it. I should... try and remember my training. I should be able to let go of this, but I can't.
1943 := I would like to keep something to remember Father as much as she would.
1944 := That would just lead into another argument. How I always despised talking to her.
1945 := We have more important things to do. Still... my father is dead. Just because we find the holocron doesn't mean I have to give it to her.
1946 := Yes... maybe. I don't feel good about it, still.
1947 := It does, doesn't it? I can't seem to help myself.
1948 := I don't know. Part of me would keep it just so she didn't get it. I don't like that part of me.
1949 := I would have thought my Jedi training would have put me past this kind of pettiness. I wish... I really don't want to think about this.
1950 := Please, let's just keep going.
1951 := Father recorded all his personal thoughts in that holocron even when I knew him. Having it would be like having him with you.
1952 := I don't see why she deserves it, however. She drove him to his death. I loved him... and I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye.
1953 := I feel the end of our quest is near. Soon we will discover the location of the Star Forge; though what will happen next is... uncertain.
1954 := I've been watching you. I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occassions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.
1955 := I've been watching you. I've seen how you have resisted great temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable.
1956 := The path of the light is a difficult one to walk. We might not even see the shadows until we are surrounded and can never find our way back.
1957 := My role in what you will become is a small one. I can only give you the warnings taught to me by my own master, ultimately it is your own actions that will decide your fate.
1958 := I know we have not spoken often during our time together, despite my best efforts. And to this point I have respected your privacy. But there is something we must discuss.
1959 := No, this cannot wait any longer. You have no understanding of what we are going up against; I will not allow you to go in unprepared!
1960 := Never mind.
1961 := Do you have something you want to say to me, Bastila?
1962 := Why? What do you think will happen to you?
1963 := So what does this mean for us?
1964 := And I feel more alive when I'm with you.
1965 := I can't promise that. Who knows what will happen?
1966 := I'll see things through, I promise.
1967 := When we last talked you said you needed time to think. So?
1968 := Yes, I think so.
1969 := What are you talking about?
1970 := I really don't want to hear this...
1971 := What is it supposed to be like?
1972 := What are you trying to say, exactly?
1973 := Oh? I think I need some physical proof of that...
1974 := Sorry, Bastila. That starship won't fly. I'm not interested.
1975 := Oh. When will you know for sure?
1976 := Are you interested in me or in my ability to use the Force?
1977 := But I don't feel anything for you, Bastila.
1978 := You could leave, if you had to.
1979 := You make it sound like a death sentence.
1980 := No. Nothing.
1981 := It doesn't matter. Nothing can come of it.
1982 := Yes, I think so.
1983 := No, I suppose not.
1984 := I'd like to talk about what you said before. About giving in to your emotions.
1985 := Oh, get over yourself, already.
1986 := No, I disagree!
1987 := Why do you say that?
1988 := Oh? You see that, too? I don't need you anymore.
1989 := You're doing your best, I'm sure.
1990 := So what now?
1991 := You're being too hard on yourself.
1992 := Maybe we could help each other?
1993 := How did you expect me to be?
1994 := I don't need your help, anyway. I can find my own way.
1995 := You're curious about something?
1996 := Go ahead.
1997 := I don't think about it much.
1998 := It sounds like you have your own demons to face.
1999 := What?
2000 := I think destroying that kind of evil would be worth it.
2001 := Are you saying you don't believe in the corruption of the dark side?
2002 := It's a struggle for me, sometimes.
2003 := I just do what I think is right.
2004 := Maybe a little, sure.
2005 := Life's too short to be afraid.
2006 := No. You should try it yourself, sometime.
2007 := Do I have a choice?
2008 := You look like you have something to say.
2009 := You made that sound very painful for you to admit.
2010 := Thank you. I appreciate the gesture.
2011 := Don't forget edgy, critical and overly secretive.
2012 := I'm glad you did.
2013 := We'll see.
2014 := Great, you've had your say. Now leave me alone - for good!
2015 := Maybe, but you don't need to be like that.
2016 := Nonsense. You're not self-absorbed or stodgy.
2017 := Too little, too late. Sorry.
2018 := I'd like that, I suppose.
2019 := Oh? How close a friend would you like to be?
2020 := Forgive me if I don't trust your motives, exactly.
2021 := Then leave me alone. For good.
2022 := Friends? You could have fooled me.
2023 := Just leave me alone... for good.
2024 := *May* have been?
2025 := And when have you ever made things easy for me?
2026 := Your compliments need some work, I think.
2027 := What was that? I think I'm going deaf. You better say it again.
2028 := It's just that you sounded so pained saying it.
2029 := I'm still reeling from the shock. Was that a compliment?
2030 := Is that a compliment? From you?
2031 := You're kidding, right?
2032 := Fine. Thank you for the thought.
2033 := You can keep your thanks. I don't need it... or you.
2034 := Maybe I was just distracted by the grudging manner in which it was given.
2035 := Why did the Council send me with you on this mission?
2036 := And that's it? That's enough reason for you to accept all this?
2037 := I get the feeling that there's more going on than I know.
2038 := It was only a question. Can't I be curious?
2039 := Why not? I ignore them in yours.
2040 := What subtle accusations?
2041 := Oh, great. Another lecture. This never gets old.
2042 := Me? You're the one who thought this was her big audition for 'Masterhood'!
2043 := Hey, you started this.
2044 := I don't know what you're talking about.
2045 := Look... you either know the answer or you don't.
2046 := And if I don't believe you?
2047 := Maybe a little bit.
2048 := What can I say? It's fun.
2049 := Lighten up. I'm only joking.
2050 := Hey, you brought this on yourself.
2051 := Careful. Remember your self-control.
2052 := Maybe you shouldn't try.
2053 := Complain all you want, but I know you love it.
2054 := You could try being straight with me, for once.
2055 := I'm not so bad. You just have to learn to accept me for what I am.
2056 := I just don't trust the Council and their motives.
2057 := It just seems odd they would send me off without a Master to guide me.
2058 := You wish to talk to me?
2059 := What? You've been grading me?
2060 := My progress?
2061 := What are you trying to tell me?
2062 := Stop with the dramatics, already, I get the picture.
2063 := How can you know it is so terrible?
2064 := I couldn't see myself ever doing such things.
2065 := Must we keep discussing this?
2066 := Do whatever is required? Such as?
2067 := Perhaps it's just the reasoning for those acts you don't accept.
2068 := I don't know.
2069 := Are you saying the light side is innocent of killing?
2070 := You seem to know that temptation very well.
2071 := What do you know about it?
2072 := We're not going to go over this again, are we?
2073 := I'd like to know more about you, Bastila.
2074 := What?! You're not even a Jedi?
2075 := And yet you act like a Jedi...
2076 := Tell me how you joined the Jedi, then.
2077 := So the Jedi separates children from their families?
2078 := Discouraged? Why?
2079 := Don't you miss your family at all?
2080 := That must have been difficult.
2081 := I don't need to hear the family history, thanks.
2082 := Are you saying you no longer feel love?
2083 := But if a Jedi were to love, surely it wouldn't be all bad.
2084 := You sound very sad when you say that.
2085 := You and your father were close?
2086 := Who weren't you on good terms with?
2087 := That sounds idiotic. I would never agree to that.
2088 := Why wouldn't you be allowed to love?
2089 := And what's so wrong with that?
2090 := You need to lighten up.
2091 := It just seems wrong not to be allowed to love.
2092 := I don't need you reminding me, I assure you.
2093 := Sounds like you're the one afraid of falling.
2094 := You aren't allowed to love?
2095 := You don't sound very convinced.
2096 := You wanted to speak to me?
2097 := That's not the half of it!
2098 := Meaning what?
2099 := Thank you.
2100 := I'd like to know what you do about this mission.
2101 := Okay, forget I asked anything.
2102 := Oh, great. I never get tired of hearing how you killed Darth Revan.
2103 := Let me ask something else, then.
2104 := Nothing. Never mind.
2105 := Is it true you killed Darth Revan?
2106 := So who killed Revan, then?
2107 := But killing Revan is what you're famous for.
2108 := That's not what I heard.
2109 := But you would have killed Revan eventually, right?
2110 := What else did you expect from the Sith?
2111 := So Malak did your job for you.
2112 := Tell me what you know about the dark side.
2113 := So just why have you been so hard on me since we met?
2114 := Why the sudden change of tune?
2115 := And that's it? All is forgiven?
2116 := You have something you want to ask me?
2117 := I don't know. It seemed time for another interrogation?
2118 := Educated guess, from the way you keep staring.
2119 := Well... your face is all scrunched up like a kinrath pup.
2120 := Maybe.
2121 := No, I doubt it.
2122 := What do you mean?
2123 := What do you think I should do?
2124 := I will try.
2125 := I won't do anything to hurt you.
2126 := I doubt I'll be a risk to the mission.
2127 := I would appreciate any help you could offer.
2128 := I don't need your help.
2129 := It works both ways, doesn't it? You could help me stay strong.
2130 := So you're just worried about yourself, then.
2131 := I don't need you harassing me, thanks.
2132 := Why are you getting so upset?
2133 := I don't think mastering my emotions is necessary.
2134 := You could warn me when I do something bad. Blink once for dark side, twice for light.
2135 := You look like something's bothering you.
2136 := I still don't understand this bond of ours.
2137 := Our relationship? Is this some kind of clumsy come-on?
2138 := What sort of questions?
2139 := Forget it. I'm not interested.
2140 := Fine, fine, ask your questions.
2141 := Nothing with the Jedi is ever simple.
2142 := I'm sick of answering questions!
2143 := Alright, ask away.
2144 := I'm a Hutt in human form plotting to overthrow the Republic.
2145 := Nothing extravagant. I'm a soldier.
2146 := I was a scout. The fleet recruited me for my skills.
2147 := I was a smuggler before I joined the fleet.
2148 := Kashyyyk. I'm a Wookiee... can't you tell?
2149 := Deralia. It's in a remote system. Why?
2150 := 3,012. Healthy living, you know.
2151 := Alright, I've had enough.
2152 := Wasn't all this in my service records?
2153 := And what did you find out?
2154 := You're not going to demand answers this time?
2155 := No, of course not.
2156 := Why not? My answer would be the same.
2157 := Wait a minute... I have you to blame for being on that ship?
2158 := I don't believe in this 'bond', regardless of what the Jedi Council said.
2159 := Doesn't the bond mean my presence is necessary?
2160 := You want to talk to me about something?
2161 := Good. Let's keep it that way.
2162 := If you have something to say, just say it.
2163 := Well, gosh, it must just be my overactive imagination.
2164 := Why do you want to know?
2165 := Because I don't like being interrogated.
2166 := I don't. No need to be touchy about it.
2167 := So I know exactly what you're looking for.
2168 := We were looking for you.
2169 := And rescued the damsel in distress. Don't forget that.
2170 := I'll be happy to answer whatever questions you have.
2171 := You're surprised?
2172 := Whatever makes you happy, I guess.
2173 := What did I do to deserve this?
2174 := Look, I don't know what your problem is...
2175 := Sorry, I have better things to do.
2176 := No more difficult than you.
2177 := Hey! Just who do you think you are, anyway?
2178 := Before we rescued you, you mean.
2179 := Have it your way, then.
2180 := You didn't escape the Black Vulkars until we arrived, as I recall.
2181 := Can't you just admit that you were rescued?
2182 := You just did!
2183 := I want to talk about that dream.
2184 := Never mind.
2185 := Do you think we will receive more of these visions?
2186 := I'm not sure I like the idea of you being in my dreams.
2187 := I suppose that's possible.
2188 := Pretty certain, yes.
2189 := What do you think Malak and Revan were doing?
2190 := Why did we dream of Malak and Revan?
2191 := Isn't it a bit convenient to dream about our enemies?
2192 := What do you mean by a 'trace'?
2193 := Well, I certainly didn't want to dream about them.
2194 := I still don't understand why we shared this 'vision'.
2195 := But how did our fates become linked?
2196 := It just seems a little... convenient.
2197 := You make the Force sound alive.
2198 := That's all I wanted to know.
2199 := I have another question.
2200 := We have no free will of our own, then?
2201 := Not me! I do what I want.
2202 := Believe me, the feeling is mutual.
2203 := Well, thanks a lot.
2204 := So you kept the holocron.
2205 := So do you feel better now?
2206 := Can you show me one of the visions again?
2207 := The vision we had on Tatooine.
2208 := The vision we had on Kashyyyk.
2209 := The vision we had on Manaan.
2210 := The vision we had on Korriban.
2211 := Do you know anything about this place?
2212 := Do you want to talk?
2213 := Do you want to talk?
2214 := I don't think we have time to go searching for anything.
2215 := She certainly seemed to upset you.
2216 := Why didn't you ask about her sickness?
2217 := Why would she lie about it?
2218 := You sound bitter.
2219 := Are you going to give the holocron to her?
2220 := Probably not. She doesn't deserve it.
2221 := Do you need it more than she does?
2222 := You might want to consider it.
2223 := You don't think we should look for the holocron?
2224 := Maybe you're right.
2225 := That sounds a bit selfish.
2226 := You'd keep it for yourself?
2227 := Why do you think she wants it so badly?
2228 := I'm sorry, Bastila. I will try to do better.
2229 := I don't need a lecture from you. Not now, not ever.
2230 := Don't worry. The dark side has no sway over me.
2231 := I couldn't have done it without your help.
2232 := I don't want to talk to you! Can't you take a hint?
2233 := Not now, Bastila.
2234 := Fine. What is it?
2235 := So deal with it. Why are you asking me about it?
2236 := What? You think I don't have something better to do?
2237 := Yeah? What do you want?
2238 := Your choice. I'm here if you want something done right.
2239 := This thing with Jagi... I... I don't know. Give me some time and I'll be able to sort this out on my own.
2240 := Is there something else you wanted?
2241 := I'm not happy with the way my life has turned. I'm not the Mandalore I once was. I don't even think I'm the merc I was when I joined you.
2242 := I think... I think I need something more than killing and fighting in my life. I need a purpose or something like that.
2243 := Killing is never enough. Anybody can kill just by pushing a button. A warrior fights his battles himself - as you have done - and tries to defeat all comers.
2244 := The way the Mandalorians - we - fought... it holds no appeal for me. To rape and ravage worlds for the thrill of battle... It gets old. Very old.
2245 := Honor in battle. Cheating death. Comrades in arms. The code of the Mandalore.
2246 := I think I'm something different now. Maybe more, maybe less. 
2247 := I don't think there is really any place left in the galaxy for the Mandalorian clans like they were. I don't know if I can go on forever fighting as I have. Even warriors get insightful in their old age...
2248 := No... The time of the clans is past. I don't think the galaxy wants them anymore. Maybe in the future, but not now.
2249 := Once my time with you is done, once you have moved on to greater things, I'll find my own way once again.
2250 := Maybe the Mandalorian clans will be reborn again. Maybe even under the Republic... or the Sith.
2251 := But dreaming about the future is stupid right now. We should get down to our business and finish it. If we survive all this... maybe we could talk about it then.
2252 := Working for Davik was like driving a spike through the side of your head... Sure you get something new in there, but in the end, you've lost something as well.
2253 := Beating up people who wouldn't - or couldn't - pay, strong-arming his competitors, killing who he said. It was busy work, nothing decent.
2254 := Maybe...
2255 := I've killed many people. I can't say I'm proud of it, but I have. Criminals, competitors, businessmen, police... women, children...
2256 := Jedi were a better challenge, but they hardly ever poked around in the Under City.
2257 := ... Until you came along...
2258 := But I never wanted to challenge you. Never felt the need. Maybe I knew I couldn't win... just like all those years ago.
2259 := Maybe you would have. But you're not who you were back then, I can tell. You've changed... and maybe I have too.
2260 := I remember a time when I could do anything I wanted... Kill, maim, murder... It was all the same to me.
2261 := But now... now that I'm older, I can look back and regret...
2262 := Ha! Good one. That's like a warrior should. Like what you see in a Mandalorian.
2263 := In a Mandalorian... I'm not even sure what that is anymore. The Mandalorian are gone, defeated by the Republic and swept away by time.
2264 := I look back and regret all the chances I had as a warrior, and then all the chances I've had since then. I shouldn't be getting like this, not when so many other things are happening... but...
2265 := It feels like... like something has changed inside and I don't know what it is. Bah! This is unbecoming of a warrior! Let's get on with everything before I start getting sentimental or something.
2266 := Yeah, probably. Heh. You'd likely have beaten me again.
2267 := Assassin. Mercenary. Those are names people give guys like me who do the killing to make us seem better or worse in their eyes.
2268 := The war we had with the Republic was supposed to be the most glorious battle of our history, but... it was a very costly one. I guess we didn't think of how much we could lose in it.
2269 := Yeah... yeah you did. You were a great warrior Revan. A great general.
2270 := There weren't many of us left after that last battle. Mandalore himself was killed at the hands of the Jedi Revan. The best of us could not defeat him!
2271 := After that last battle, those of us that survived were stripped of our weapons, our armor, and our Basilisks.
2272 := The Republic's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.
2273 := Revan's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.
2274 := For many this was not enough. While the rest of us were sent into exile on the Outer Rim, they tried to relive the old days - raiding worlds. They're nothing more than bandits now.
2275 := Yeah. I found work on Taris.
2276 := Yeah, I came to Taris.
2277 := Enforcing for Davik was not... stimulating. The gangs on Taris and Davik's rivals were trash. They give no thrill in battle, no honor or glory in defeating them. It was like stepping on bugs.
2278 := I sought worthy challenges, but the best that Taris could offer were nothing to me.
2279 := But I think now - with you - I may finally find opponents worth fighting.
2280 := Maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't. Either way, I think that by following you I can get something out of it.
2281 := Maybe later I'll tell you more about what it was like to work for Davik. For now, though, we should get on with our lives.
2282 := We fought against the Republic forces for some time, over the course of many battles.
2283 := At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once the Jedi Revan had taken charge, things began to turn against us.
2284 := The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. Revan was a genius on the field.
2285 := We've... we've already been over this. It was a moment of weakness, a stumble brought on by unbridled passions. But my emotions are firmly in check once more.
2286 := We need to stay focused on stopping Darth Malak. And I want the others to stay focused as well. I don't want them to get suspicious and start gossiping about our little encounter!
2287 := Revan abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike, and was willing to make sacrifices in order to advance goals.
2288 := And in the end, Revan proved too much for us.
2289 := The Sith had gone - retreated into their empire. They sealed themselves off from the rest of the galaxy. We thought it would be centuries before they'd come back.
2290 := It's amazing that they could rebuild their fleet so fast. But at the time, it looked like the galaxy was in our grasp!
2291 := There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind Revan. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.
2292 := It looked like the entire galaxy was within our grasp!
2293 := I still remember that final battle in the skies above Malachor V. The two fleets filling the space around it, outshining the stars...
2294 := It was not your ships or your men or your vaunted 'fight for freedom' that won this, the final battle of the war.
2295 := It was by the actions of one person - you - that the Republic prevailed.
2296 := Your strategies and tactics defeated the best we could send against you. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity of your attacks, the tenacity of your defenses and the subtleties of your plans.
2297 := You fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.
2298 := It was by the actions of one person, the Jedi Revan, that you prevailed.
2299 := So, until our mission is over we need to act with discretion. We shouldn't speak of this anymore... not until Malak is defeated!
2300 := I'm... afraid so. Although I suppose I should thank you for all you've done. For the lessons you helped me learn.
2301 := Revan's strategies and tactics defeated the best of us. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity, the tenacity and the subtlety of Revan's plans.
2302 := Revan fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.
2303 := Ha! Don't be naive. The Republic is not invincible. This battle was the end of the war, one way or another.
2304 := It was what we had wanted all along, in a way. We wanted to fight the best in a battle that would be remembered for centuries. And we did.
2305 := And you won.
2306 := I hold no grudge against you, nor do any of my people. It was the greatest of honors to fight against you, even in defeat. It is even more of an honor to fight beside you now.
2307 := Had you been born of the Mandalorian clans, surely nothing in this galaxy would have been able to stop us.
2308 := And Revan won.
2309 := I wish it could be otherwise, but you have to understand that this is the way it must be. I am a Jedi, after all.
2310 := I hope you can put this behind you. You need to focus on stopping Malak, as difficult as that may be. Come, we should continue our mission.
2311 := I don't hold a grudge against Revan, and neither do any of my people. It was the greatest moment of my life to be in that battle.
2312 := If Revan had been a Mandalorian, nothing in the galaxy would have stopped us.
2313 := But wishing for the past to be different is useless. Better to look to the future. As we should now. We'll talk more later, I think.
2314 := Yeah, we lost. But there is no shame in it. We lost to the greatest single warrior the Republic has ever known.
2315 := But it was close! So close!
2316 := At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once you had taken charge, things began to turn against us.
2317 := The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. You were a genius on the field. You are held in very high regard among my people.
2318 := You abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike. You made sacrifices in order to advance your goals. Such strategies had never been enough to best us before.
2319 := In the end, you proved too much for us.
2320 := There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind you. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.
2321 := Hm... I think I'll tell you a bit about the recent war we had with the Republic. That might be more familiar to you.
2322 := The one where the Jedi Revan beat my people.
2323 := We started by conquering worlds just outside the Republic. We did it quietly so the Republic wouldn't really know what was going on until too late.
2324 := When we finally did hit the Republic worlds, they had no idea we were coming.
2325 := We came in through three invasion corridors in adjacent sectors. Anyone who put up a fight - or wouldn't fight - was crushed. We razed whole worlds trying to provoke the Republic into fighting us.
2326 := I don't particularly enjoy wiping out worlds for its own sake, but the cowardly tactics the Republic defenders used left us little choice.
2327 := They had the choice not to fight. We meet the enemy wherever they are hiding and we wipe them out. A few cities is a small price to pay for a world.
2328 := Hiding in the homes of civilians. Using families as shields. Thinking we would not use appropriate force on their bases inside major cities.
2329 := They underestimated our resolve and what measures are acceptable in war. Those who cannot defend themselves should not be around those who can in battle.
2330 := If annihilating a city is the kind of power it takes to overwhelm a Republic shield device, then that's what we did. Necessary force to destroy all opposition.
2331 := It's wrong to hide with shields surrounding you hoping the enemy will be so good as to throw themselves at your feet to be slaughtered!
2332 := I have no time or patience for cowards! They deserve to be hunted down and exterminated like vermin!
2333 := There was no honor in wiping them out like rats. But some of your forces did redeem the Republic in our eyes... especially later...
2334 := Later... when Revan had joined the war. But we'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.
2335 := Later... when you had joined the war. We'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.
2336 := The one where you beat my people.
2337 := I don't have as many strange stories like the last one I told you, but I do have a couple about me and the stuff I've done.
2338 := In one battle above the world of Althir, my unit managed to defeat a force of Althiri ten times our own size. That battle gained me command of an entire sub-sect of my clan.
2339 := Ha! I was the best! Except for Mandalore of course. He was the only person alive except Revan who could have beat me.
2340 := For five days they had managed to hold off our forces, keeping us to the outer rings of their world, preventing us from attacking it directly.
2341 := My task was to assault one of their flanks with a false attack. The Althiri would be drawn out by the units I had sent in.
2342 := Once they had surrounded those units, the bulk of my forces would attack from the rear and defeat them in detail.
2343 := They weren't stupid. Stupid races don't make starships and weapons of mass destruction. But they weren't masters of the arts of war as Mandalorians are.
2344 := Things did not go as I had planned. I saw an opening - a mistake they had made in the disposition of their forces - and took it!
2345 := While fending off our main force, they had let their fleet split in two! The center of their entire fleet was left exposed!
2346 := I turned my forces and assaulted the center of their fleet, decimating them!
2347 := This is a chance given to a warrior once or twice in a lifetime. The chance to change the course of history in a single act.
2348 := Their slow, ponderous ship could not turn to face us without being overwhelmed. Their command vessels were destroyed in seconds. Their ranks were thrown into chaos.
2349 := It was most amusing to watch the surviving ships scatter and flee. Several even tried to dive through the plane of the rings to escape us!
2350 := They were shredded by the rings, or crashed into rocks, or were destroyed by our forces as we pursued them.
2351 := Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against your Jedi Revan.
2352 := Another time maybe I'll tell you about how the war with the Republic went. For now let's just get on with things.
2353 := Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against you.
2354 := You want another story, eh? You want to hear about some other world getting wasted? Heh, I knew you were the type.
2355 := Your stagnant Republic has never seen some of the strange creatures and races we fought on the Outer Rim in those years. Heh, and you never will now.
2356 := If a world isn't strong enough to defend itself, it's basically forfeit. But this story is about something a little different.
2357 := We were going through the asteroid fields of the Crispin system at the very edge of the galaxy, playing with the pirates and smugglers we found there.
2358 := The main belt in the Crispin system consists of mainly small rocks covered in frozen methane gas shells and the pirates were using them for cover.
2359 := Ha! I remember using a thermal generator to cause the outer layer of one of the asteroids to vaporize in a picosecond. It blew out and shredded the three smugglers using it for cover!
2360 := But... that was a mistake...
2361 := The asteroid I had targeted was smaller than most, maybe a dozen meters on a side. On the outside it looked the same as any other: just a ball covered in frozen gas.
2362 := But something must have been inside it... something inactive in the cold. The heat of my blast might have triggered something or woken something up.
2363 := After I had hit, spots of light and heat appeared all over the thin shell still covering it, evaporating the gases.
2364 := What lay underneath looked like some sort of rocky growth... a deformed rock pitted by scores of micrometeorite scars. I think something even older might have been inside that.
2365 := It started rotating - faster and faster as we watched it. After a second it started spraying fire - thermal projectiles that melted our armor like wax. We were caught completely by surprise.
2366 := Before we could counter-attack, it fled at an incredible speed.
2367 := We couldn't catch it, but we could follow its hyperspace wake.
2368 := We followed its trail as far as we could, heading away from the galactic core. When it finally led beyond the edge of our galaxy, we abandoned our efforts.
2369 := Anything that wants to commit suicide in that great void is not worth our trouble trying to catch.
2370 := That's the only story I have for now. I'll tell you some more stuff later, if we get the chance.
2371 := Maybe... but maybe not.
2372 := I was one of the best youth warriors in clan Ordo in my time. No one before me had mastered the power of our Basilisk war droids as quickly as I had. Except Mandalore himself of course.
2373 := In those days we were sweeping across the Outer Rim. Destroying all who fought us.
2374 := Young Mandalores would prove themselves in real combat with unknown opponents above a thousand worlds. Each brought back the story of his achievements.
2375 := We were still recovering from the war we fought with the Sith. We were not yet strong enough to fight the Republic again. We needed to train another generation to do that.
2376 := Ha! We would travel from world to world, and descend on it in our Basilisk war droids. I still remember my first combat...
2377 := I remember it well, orbiting high above a placid world, its defenses just stirring. As was tradition, I would go ahead of the first wave to find enemies in the thickest fighting.
2378 := I remember sitting there in my armor, linked directly with the Basilisk thrumming beneath me. My heart racing with fear at the coming battle.
2379 := Every new warrior has to fear to understand how to beat it. You must know that.
2380 := The doors opened in front me and the air was sucked out of the drop bay, scattering crystals of frozen vapor across my path.
2381 := I can't describe what it feels like to look directly down at a world, falling continuously as you circle it, with barely fifteen centimeters of armor plate protecting you.
2382 := When the magnetic locks disengaged on my droid I plunged out of the drop bay towards the battle that waited below.
2383 := I don't remember. It doesn't matter anyway, that world's dead now.
2384 := The exhilaration, the euphoria, I felt as I streaked into the atmosphere, dodging self-guided projectile and beam weapons, was unmatched.
2385 := A 80 kilometer plunge through the atmosphere, dodging and weaving, the outside of my armor glowing like the sun with the heat of re-entry.
2386 := And with barely thirty meters to spare, I twisted and skimmed the surface, firing at the giant beam generators that were in my path.
2387 := The explosion from that sent shockwaves that levelled the entire complex around it. It was the moment of my life.
2388 := I'll never forget those times. But... things are different now. We can't go on fighting the way we had. There are too few of us left now.
2389 := But I don't really want to talk about this anymore. I trust I've satisfied your curiosity for now?
2390 := Is there something else you want to know?
2391 := You want to hear tales of my exploits? Of the wars I've seen and fought, the enemies I've seen die by my hand? Heh, sure, I'll humor you.
2392 := My name's Canderous of the Mandalorian clan Ordo. I've been fighting across the galaxy for 40 of your years.
2393 := For my people it's the honor and glory of battle that rules us. It's through combat that we prove our worth, gain renown and make our fortunes.
2394 := Win or lose, as long as the fight is worthy, then honor is gained. The glory at having triumphed over impossible odds is what drives us.
2395 := If there's nothing at stake - your possessions, your life, your world - then the battle's meaningless.
2396 := We Mandalore take everything we are and throw it into battle. It's the true test of yourself - the battle against death... against oblivion.
2397 := The days of combat and glory and cheating death at every turn seem to be over now... I take what I can.
2398 := All life dies eventually. A true warrior is one who can beat it down whenever it raises its head. But...
2399 := The Sith came to us with an offer: to fight a worthy enemy in a battle that would be remembered forever.
2400 := Times have changed now. The Mandalore clans have been scattered across the Outer Rim, the Republic is in decline and the Sith Empire rises to take its place.
2401 := The clans as they were aren't a threat, but the galaxy still fears us. Ha! People think we war out of spite, or bloodlust. They don't understand, and fear that.
2402 := We only wanted the challenge of the battle, and glory from it - win or lose. And we lost.
2403 := But now I have no real challenges. Crushing Davik's enemies and the pathetic gangs in the Lower City of Taris could not be considered the most glorious of tasks.
2404 := When I think of the battles I've fought... the thousands I've killed... the worlds I've burned... I weep for my past.
2405 := We'll never speak of this again. We've got work to do, so let's get to it.
2406 := Heh, don't worry I think you've got enough there as it is. You don't want to go overloading youself on stims, otherwise you might destroy your adrenal system.
2407 := A real warrior knows his own limits and doesn't overestimate himself.
2408 := Ha! Stimulants make a warrior out of even the weakest human!
2409 := Here's a stamina boosting stimulant to help you get tougher.
2410 := Here's a strength boosting stimulant to help you get stronger.
2411 := Here's a speed boosting stimulant to help you get quicker.
2412 := There anything else you need?
2413 := This world is... odd. It looks like a battlefield, but the environment here is lush and green. Whatever happened here was a long time ago.
2414 := I have seen many strange worlds in my time, but this world is stranger still.
2415 := I don't like this place. Something happened... or is happening here and I don't like it. We should get out of here as soon as possible.
2416 := Korriban is a Sith world, that's for sure. I mean, just look at this place.
2417 := When we were fighting with the Republic with the Sith, this was one of the major staging points for the invasion.
2418 := We were never allowed to land our troops on the world though, so we never knew what the Sith really do here.
2419 := Rumor has it that the leader of our clans at the time, Mandalore, did go down. They say the Sith perform terrible magics here.
2420 := Tatooine is one big desert with rocks sticking out. I heard that some of my people came here after the war, but I don't know what happened to them.
2421 := The world of my clan - Ordo - was much like this. Dust basins and rock crags. But my world at least has some green around the equator - this place is just sand all over.
2422 := There are some vicious people on this world, but the desert is the real enemy. Trips out in the desert - especially the deep desert - should be taken very carefully.
2423 := Well... It has big trees - in case your eyes don't work anymore. But I do know that there is one exceptional race on this world: the Wookiees.
2424 := The Wookiees, although primitive compared to us, are surprisingly capable warriors. They're pretty strong and pick up combat techniques pretty quick.
2425 := I think they're more than a match for the average Republic or Sith trooper. When we were looking for targets, we considered this world carefully.
2426 := We were wondering if we'd have to use larger weapons than our war droids if we wanted to clear the damn forests so we could fight in the open.
2427 := Too many trees means they can go into hiding too easy. And what's a continent or two turned to glass if we get the whole world after.
2428 := Water worlds never had much of an appeal for us to conquer. They may put up a good fight in their own environment - no match for us, of course - but they don't really have anything of value either.
2429 := The thing this world is good for is a substance known as Kolto. Kolto is the single best healing substance in the galaxy.
2430 := But the Mandalore are not as weak and fragile as your Republic and Sith warriors. When we enter battle, we carry weapons powerful enough to pulverize cities.
2431 := Both in our wars, and in our own personal combats, there are no survivors. So Kolto does not hold the appeal it does for your peoples.
2432 := From what we saw from space this world doesn't have a lot of people. I couldn't really have found much work here anyway, so I never had an interest.
2433 := It looks like a farm world. The Republic has thousands of these places - ones that get by farming crops and hunting herds of native beasts.
2434 := But I might have underestimated this place. It seems to be more than I had thought.
2435 := *grunt* Yeah, I know about Taris. I wasted the last two years in this rat-hole working for Davik.
2436 := I suppose an accurate way to describe this place would be 'cesspool' or 'dump'.
2437 := You got the rich people on top, the poor people being crushed underneath, and people like me trying to make a living doing the crushing.
2438 := It's not exactly what you'd call spiritually fulfilling work, but it gets the bills paid. And on Taris, money can go a long way to making things easier.
2439 := You have anything else you want to ask?
2440 := I... I think this has affected me in ways that I didn't anticipate... I think I'll need time to sort things out.
2441 := Thanks for what you did, whatever your intentions might have been. I just need... time.
2442 := I've been given a challenge I can't ignore. We've got to go to the dune seas of Tatooine so I can find Jagi and kill him for his insult to me!
2443 := The sooner we get to Tatooine the better.
2444 := This is between me and Jagi. You don't have to get involved. If you're lucky, he might spill something before I spread him in a paste over the dunes.
2445 := This looks like the end of our partnership. The battle we fight here will change the face of the galaxy.
2446 := You, Revan, are the single greatest warrior of this age, and any battle we fight will bring me honor. I'll stay by your side through anything.
2447 := I don't think I'm ready to give up this life of mine, this life of fighting, not quite yet. We have things we need to do here.
2448 := I'm your man until the end, whatever path you take.
2449 := I don't think we can delay much here. We should fight our way out as quickly as possible.
2450 := Nothing more for now.
2451 := What are your thoughts now?
2452 := What are your thoughts now?
2453 := That doesn't sound much like a Mandalorian...
2454 := Isn't killing enough?
2455 := What will you do?
2456 := What are you going to do?
2457 := You aren't a Mandalorian now?
2458 := Tell me about when you worked for Davik.
2459 := Now that's the way things should be done!
2460 := Killed his competitors?
2461 := You know I'd have beaten you again!
2462 := I regret to tell you that I never regret anything.
2463 := Over what?
2464 := Regret in a Mandalorian is unbecoming.
2465 := A wise decision.
2466 := You were an assassin?
2467 := Tell me more about the Mandalorian Wars.
2468 := But I kicked your tails so badly?
2469 := There must not have been many of you left.
2470 := You found work as a mercenary?
2471 := And you eventually came to Taris.
2472 := Opponents who could easily kill us.
2473 := You are a worthy companion.
2474 := I am honored.
2475 := How much did you lose?
2476 := But what about the Sith?
2477 := If Revan had not stopped you, someone else would have.
2478 := What happened in the battle?
2479 := The Republic will always prevail.
2480 := Why didn't you retreat?
2481 := But you eventually lost.
2482 := You couldn't have won against the whole galaxy.
2483 := If I had not stopped you, someone else would have.
2484 := I was wondering if you had any more war stories.
2485 := You had the choice not to destroy them.
2486 := No honor in defending themselves?
2487 := What do you mean?
2488 := Now that's my kind of warfare.
2489 := You could have found another way.
2490 := But killing people is wrong!
2491 := You mean when we kicked your tails.
2492 := How did they redeem themselves?
2493 := Later?
2494 := Yeah, yeah, you were a great warrior.
2495 := I think I know where this is going.
2496 := Tell me the story.
2497 := These Althiri don't seem too bright.
2498 := Let me guess... you won?
2499 := Ah. Did it work?
2500 := What did they do?
2501 := You disobeyed your orders?
2502 := You were a great warrior Canderous.
2503 := Where did you fight this time?
2504 := What do you mean?
2505 := You Mandalorians never were too smart.
2506 := Did it backfire?
2507 := Why? What happened?
2508 := What happened next?
2509 := A ship!
2510 := An asteroid?
2511 := I would have harnessed that power sooner.
2512 := How barbaric!
2513 := What was your story?
2514 := What happened next?
2515 := Ha! Some Mandalorian you were!
2516 := Who were you fighting anyway?
2517 := Those droids sure are something.
2518 := You dropped from orbit riding a droid?!
2519 := I want a Basilisk war droid!
2520 := That was some fight.
2521 := That's horrible!
2522 := I didn't think Mandalorians got afraid.
2523 := I was wondering if you had any interesting stories.
2524 := The Mandalorians destroy worlds for honor?
2525 := Then what are you doing now?
2526 := You seek death?
2527 := Is that why the Mandalorians attacked the Republic?
2528 := Is that why you work as a mercenary?
2529 := Can you give me some adrenal stimulants?
2530 := Do you know anything about this world?
2531 := We should get going then.
2532 := Can we talk about this?
2533 := What happened out there? Why is Jagi so mad at you?
2534 := Sorry. I can't be of much help with that.
2535 := I'm not really sure. You can figure it out on your own, can't you?
2536 := Yes? What's on your mind?
2537 := You got it.
2538 := If you're ready to talk, then yes... so am I.
2539 := I can't hate you. I tried... I wanted to hold you responsible for all the things you've done. For my... for my wife, for Telos... for Dustil. But I can't.
2540 := Maybe you shouldn't. I would hope that my standing by you would mean something to you, but maybe it doesn't. Maybe it just can't.
2541 := I got the revenge I always wanted when Saul died, but it hasn't brought me the peace that I thought it would.
2542 := All I can think of now is the promise I made to protect you from what's going to come. It's given me a reason to look past simple revenge.
2543 := Despite whatever part of Revan is inside you, the... the darkness that must surely be there, it isn't who you are.
2544 := That's why I can't hate you, why I don't want any more revenge. You don't have to be Revan, you can be so much more. Whatever the Jedi did to you, they gave you that chance.
2545 := You have this huge destiny waiting for you, and I just fear that if you're alone it could swallow you whole. I mean, is there room in there for me? Will you let me help you?
2546 := Oh. I had... hoped that there might be. I don't blame you. Uh. You're not the same woman I met on Taris anymore, are you?
2547 := Well, thank you for your honesty. I still intend to see this through to the end, whatever happens. Malak needs to be stopped.
2548 := And uh, you... you'll make the decision you have to. And we'll have to deal with that day when it comes.
2549 := I think I would be hurt worse if I didn't try.
2550 := Whatever's happened up until this point, there's going to come a time very soon where you're going to have to make a choice. And there won't be any turning back.
2551 := I want you to make the right choice. I want to give you a reason to.
2552 := You gave me a future. I want to give you a future, too... with me. I think I could love you, if you give me the chance.
2553 := Neither do I. But does that really matter if we love each other?
2554 := Well then I'm... I'm glad. Let's... let's face the future together, then... there's still a lot to do.
2555 := Well then I hope I can save you. From yourself.
2556 := You have a darkness inside you that must be Revan. But there's more to you, as well. I see it, I know it's there.
2557 := I do. It's serious, though... I need your attention. Is this a good time?
2558 := Alright. We'll talk later, then.
2559 := Alright. I'm, uh... I'm concerned about you. I've been keeping these thoughts to myself, mostly, but I think it's time I say something.
2560 := It's about you. I'm worried about what might happen to you. You have a lot of courage, and the fact you've remained strong is amazing, but there is even greater danger ahead.
2561 := I think you might be setting yourself up for a fall. Maybe at the urging of the Jedi, I don't know... but you're definitely going to become a target.
2562 := If, uh... if I'm going to find some purpose beyond taking revenge on Saul, then it's going to have to be in protecting you.
2563 := I don't know why, but I think some terrible fate is waiting for you. I think the Jedi Council knows it, too. And I don't want that to come to pass.
2564 := Don't chalk it up to my paranoia just yet. Something isn't right. I blamed it on you, before, but I... I think the Jedi didn't tell us everything.
2565 := If I'm going to live past Saul, I need you to, as well. Let me protect you... from yourself, from the Sith... you have to let me try.
2566 := I, uh... I guess I have no other choice. I will still help you, if I can... but I guess you're on your own.
2567 := If that's the way you want it, I hope things go well. Let's, uh... let's get back to what we were doing.
2568 := I'm glad to hear that. I'll do my best.
2569 := Because... because I never got the chance to save my wife and son. Because I didn't stop Saul when I had the chance.
2570 := Because I finally have the chance to do it right. You are an extraordinary woman... you make me think that maybe I might have some purpose beyond revenge.
2571 := I don't know whether it means anything to you... but it does to me.
2572 := I know that there's going to come a day when you'll look in the mirror and wonder how you ever got to become what you are... and by then it will be too late.
2573 := I *sigh* I... don't know. I'm not the best of men, and I'm not the strongest fighter there is... but I'll find a way.
2574 := That's where I think you're wrong. You can't do this on your own. Nobody could.
2575 := It's about you. I'm worried about what you're doing to yourself... how much you've succumbed to violence and anger.
2576 := I knew it was possible for this to happen to you... and it just pains me to see it. I've been down this path. And I don't recommend it.
2577 := Oh. I hadn't thought you'd noticed...
2578 := Well, I ah... I've just been admiring you. Not, uhh, not anything like that, though...
2579 := I've been watching you in action. Your, your skills... you have a natural talent that is incredible.
2580 := Not that, ah, all I do is watch you or anything. I don't mean anything by it.
2581 := Oh. Right. I'll, ah, I'll just pay attention to what I'm doing...
2582 := Well... maybe a few. I hope you won't mind if I keep those to myself.
2583 := Ha! Why didn't you tell me that sooner? You would have saved me a lot of trouble.
2584 := I will say one thing, however. We've come a long way with your help. Whether it's the Force or fate or just dumb luck... I'm glad you're here.
2585 := We probably would have never made it this far without you. I... should have said this long before, instead of doubting you. I, ah, hope you can forgive me.
2586 := Err... what do you mean?
2587 := What am I supposed to say? I was wrong. I was a stubborn fool. I... Look, I have trouble admitting it when a beautiful woman has my number...ok?
2588 := Sorry. Didn't mean to... embarass you. I'll stop.
2589 := I'll, ah, take that as a yes. I'm glad that's settled. Shall we... shall we get back to what we were doing?
2590 := And you accepted it... but that doesn't mean I'm forgiven. I'd like to be.
2591 := I guess I'm a proud man. I... don't admit things like this easily.
2592 := Thank you. Let's, ah... let's get back to what we were doing.
2593 := Because you're an impressive and beautiful woman. In some ways... good ways... you remind me of my wife and I'd like to make things right between us.
2594 := I've been watching how you deal with people. You have a real finesse that is incredible to watch in action.
2595 := I've been watching you work on the com. Your skill with computers is incredible.
2596 := I've been watching you wield that lightsaber, actually. Your finesse with it is incredible.
2597 := You mean if I kill him?
2598 := I... never thought about it. I suppose I always assumed that I would be dead once Saul was.
2599 := That's never occurred to me. I've always been the captain of my own ship, after all... or thought about going after Saul on my own.
2600 := Understand that whenever I envisioned taking on Saul in the past, it was always as the captain of my own ship... or alone. In those cases I would risk everything.
2601 := I'm not in the same situation, now. I wouldn't risk hurting you... or the others.
2602 := You don't think I would throw away everything we're doing here, do you?
2603 := Of course it means something to me! The Sith have to be stopped! You think it doesn't matter to me that everyone on Taris is dead? That the Republic is in danger?
2604 := I would like to think that I wouldn't put you in danger. That I wouldn't forget that there's more behind Saul that needs to be stopped.
2605 := If I saw Saul, however... if I had the chance... I don't know what I would do. I really don't. I mean his death has been my entire focus for so long.
2606 := But, uh... maybe it's best I did. I have to see this through... and I will, to the end. I promise you that. No matter what.
2607 := I know. I'll... see this through. I promise you that. No matter what.
2608 := Well, that's easier said than done, but I know you mean well. I promise you I'll see this through. No matter what.
2609 := As for what comes afterward... well, let's wait until I know that I'm around to see it.
2610 := Oh... it's nothing. Sorry.
2611 := Moping? I'm not moping! I... okay, fine, maybe I'm moping a little, but you're very pushy, you know that?
2612 := I told you my wife died four years ago. I... I've just been trying to remember what she looked like.
2613 := It shouldn't be so difficult. I can remember things about her... things she did. The way she smiled, what her hair smelled like, our last fight... just not her face.
2614 := I try to hold it in my head but it's gone. Is... that strange? Maybe I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
2615 := That's a damned mean thing to say. I wasn't ready for her to go, I can't accept it. Alright?
2616 := But I *should* be able to remember her face. It's frustrating! I... feel like I'm losing her.
2617 := I, uh... it must look really strange for me to be obsessing like this, still. You must think I'm incredibly stupid.
2618 := She isn't a ghost to me. I still remember holding her as she died... and I doubt I'll forget until I've paid Saul back in kind.
2619 := That's all I have left: finding Saul and killing the scum. Don't worry... I won't waste any more time until then.
2620 := Maybe. It can't be worse than what I tell myself, sometimes.
2621 := I... suppose you're probably right. But I have to do it, anyway.
2622 := The only thing that's kept me going since she died has been the need to find Saul and kill him. It's better to think about that than... anything else.
2623 := If I can do that, then maybe I can let her go. Let it all go.
2624 := If we encounter Saul... if we ever have the chance, promise me that I will be the one to kill him. I have to settle this... I need to.
2625 := Whether it does or not, that's the way it has to be. I... guess there's no need to discuss it until then.
2626 := Thank you. I... guess there's really nothing else to say.
2627 := Ahhh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned it, even if you asked. I just find you, I don't know... easy to talk to.
2628 := To think that I once looked up to those two as the best that humanity had to offer. Now I'd like nothing more than to put a blaster to both their heads.
2629 := Although I suppose only Malak is left, isn't he? Turned on his own master, not that Revan didn't have it coming. Heh. Typical for their kind, I guess.
2630 := Well... when they returned from wherever they went, they had an entire fleet with them. Nobody knows where they got the ships.
2631 := They had a lot of them and as the years have passed there always seems to be more and more... while our forces dwindle.
2632 := Did they really get away with it, though? Revan was betrayed by Malak... and Malak hasn't won. In the end, the dark side won't help him.
2633 := Nobody does. When they left after the Mandalorian wars ended, they were Jedi. When they returned... they were something else.
2634 := No, not personally. They aided the Republic during the Mandalorian wars. They were heroes. Without them the Mandaloreans would have finished us for certain.
2635 := In the fleet, we didn't see much of the Jedi. I only met Malak once, but I was impressed by him. I guess that just shows how much the dark side can change someone.
2636 := I, uh... used to think that it was a fancy name for something that I see every day. Corruption is everywhere. People are greedy and stupid and do horrible things.
2637 := I'm starting to think it's different for the Jedi, however. That there's this evil watching them, waiting for its chance.
2638 := You have so much courage and strength in you... yet, somehow, I have no trouble imagining it differently. Like the flip side of a coin.
2639 := I've been watching you. You have this, uh... incredible darkness inside you. Some of the things you do disturb me.
2640 := It's not just you. It's Bastila, as well. She's so... intense. I don't pretend to know much about the Force... but I know evil.
2641 := That's a frightening thought. I hope you're right.
2642 := No? I know how people change. I remember how Malak looked and acted before his return... I bet the old Malak discounted the possibility that he would ever fall, as well.
2643 := No, of course not. All I'm saying is that when you have so much power, the stakes are higher. I can only imagine the kind of conflict that goes on inside you.
2644 := Neither you nor Bastila are fully trained on how to handle your power. I'm just concerned at what might come.
2645 := I didn't mean to... <Sigh> Fine, fine. I suppose I shouldn't stick my nose where it doesn't belong. I'll leave you be.
2646 := I know that, and Bastila says the same thing. You're both incredible women. I'm just... I'm just not sure this is the kind of thing you can defeat.
2647 := Well, that's not what I... I mean... I wouldn't want to see you hurt. Either of you.
2648 := I suppose finding the Star Maps is more important than your training... and your safety. I just hope there isn't a price for you to pay.
2649 := I already told you. He betrayed us all.
2650 := Well, There... there is more to it. I'm... I'm sure you don't want to hear about it.
2651 := It's just that I... don't talk about it very much. Ok?
2652 := I told you about my homeworld. Telos. Four years ago, Saul led the Sith fleet there and demanded its surrender. The planet refused and Saul proceeded to devastate its entire surface. Millions died.
2653 := I had... a wife and son on Telos. I thought they would be safe there. But my task force arrived too late to be of much help.
2654 := We didn't have enough medical supplies. The colony was burning and the dying were everywhere. I remember holding my wife and screaming for the medics. They... didn't come in time.
2655 := Gotten over it? Look - my family was everything to me. Once they were gone... I had nothing. Hunting Saul became my only purpose.
2656 := Of course not. How could you? I... had nothing left after that, really. I devoted myself to the fleet. Hunting Saul was my only purpose.
2657 := I... miss them. I know killing Saul won't bring them back, and it won't make me happy again... but I have to do it.
2658 := I don't expect you to understand. I have to pay him back for what he's done... I have to. It's all I have left.
2659 := Yes. I can't forgive Saul for this. He took everything from me, even... even my trust. I hope you can understand that.
2660 := She had courage and ... and she was stubborn. I could never talk her out of anything once she put her mind to it.
2661 := And she hated it when I signed back onto the fleet at the start of the war. I had planned on... on leaving soon, to join her...
2662 := No, it's alright, I don't mind. You deserved some kind of... explanation.
2663 := I've... never talked about it before. To anyone. I suppose it's time I finally did.
2664 := His name was Dustil and I don't know what happened to him. The colony was a complete ruin, and we never found any trace of him.
2665 := I made inquiries and followed the reports from Telos for years, but... I stopped.
2666 := Anyway... that's the story. For what it's worth.
2667 := Anyway... I hope that answers your questions. Let's, uh... let's continue with what we were doing.
2668 := I, ahhh... I'm not very good at this. I... I know I owe you an apology. Uh, more than one, probably.
2669 := I was just so desperate to finally face Saul directly in the battle over Taris, and now the Jedi have us looking for these... these Star Maps.
2670 := I know this mission is important, it's just... I feel a bit useless. I can fight, sure, but I'm no Jedi... all this feels completely out of my league.
2671 := You don't exactly pull any punches, do you? Not that I don't deserve it, I suppose.
2672 := Because this is more important. This may really, finally, make a difference... I suppose even if I can't figure out everything that's going on, I still want to help if I can.
2673 := It doesn't, I know. It's... been a while since I even had to think about that sort of thing.
2674 := I just hate not knowing what's going on and feeling this... helpless. But I shouldn't have taken that out on you. I've been a royal pain in the backside, haven't I?
2675 := No, I do worry about it. I've traveled the lanes more than once, I should know better than this.
2676 := Ha! Well... I guess I should be at least a little pleased that I haven't lost my touch.
2677 := I guess there's no harm done then. Still I, uh... I should know better by now.
2678 := So... I'm sorry. Will you accept my apology?
2679 := Don't drown me in sentiment, already. *Sigh* Fair enough, let's move on.
2680 := Done! Let's get underway, then, shall we... partner?
2681 := Have I been quiet? I suppose I have. I guess I just don't like being left out of the loop.
2682 := You want to be smart, do you? Fine. So long as I get some questions answered.
2683 := Listen, sister, I don't remember reading anywhere that it's a requirement that you remain with us after we left Taris, yet here you are.
2684 := No? Well, you certainly aren't helping matters any, either, and it's really starting to irritate me.
2685 := Left out of the loop. You know. Not being told anything... strung along. It's really starting to irritate me.
2686 := For one thing, I want to know what the Jedi Council said to you. They pulled you in there and refused to tell me a thing about it.
2687 := I'm rather curious to know what went on... and why they didn't keep you on Dantooine for training. Isn't that strange?
2688 := And why is that? You were a great help on Taris, but why would they keep you with us? Don't they... don't they have to train you?
2689 := None of my business? Uh, I'm sorry... aren't I a part of this mission? The Jedi may be in charge, but I'm risking all the same things you are!
2690 := You can be sick of whatever you like. What I'm sick of is being kept in the dark!
2691 := Are we? Why, then, does it seem like the Jedi know everything and leave the rest of us out in the cold?
2692 := I may not know much about the Jedi, but I do know they aren't famous for taking on old Padawans and sending them on dangerous assignments.
2693 := That's completely beside the point. The Jedi encouraged you to stay with us, and I don't believe the reasons they gave.
2694 := A bond? What kind of bond? You mean to say that they told you you were "tied" to Bastila in some way? Heh. I have trouble believing that.
2695 := I've been watching you... you can be cruel and impulsive. A Jedi without self-control or training, and yet the Council sends you on your way? Why?
2696 := You're a neophyte Padawan who's been saddled with the responsibility of tracking down these Star Maps. Why? That's not normal!
2697 := And what does that mean? Is this more of that destiny garbage that the Jedi keep talking about? Well, that can't be it!
2698 := I'm not going anywhere until I've paid Saul back, damn it!
2699 := I'll tell you this much... I am *not* going to wait around until I'm betrayed again!
2700 := Fine. You got it. Conversation over.
2701 := Nothing. Not yet. You just better hope I don't get a reason to.
2702 := Well, we'll just see about that, won't we?
2703 := *That* is none of your concern, Carth, and you would do well to leave the matter be.
2704 := I respect you, Bastila, but you've been as close-mouthed as the rest of the Council. If you won't talk to me, then maybe somebody else will.
2705 := I thought I said I didn't want to talk about it anymore.
2706 := I... suppose you're right. Fine, then. But I don't know why you're so interested, but here it goes.
2707 := When I think of all the men who have betrayed us, the one that stands out above them all is the one I respected the most. Saul.
2708 := You don't? I thought everyone did. Admiral Saul Karath is the commander of the entire Sith fleet. He's half the reason Malak has done so well in the war.
2709 := Saul was my commanding officer back when the Mandalorian Wars first began. He taught me everything about being a soldier... and I looked up to him.
2710 := Saul approached me before he left. He talked to me about how the Republic was on the losing side... and about how I should start thinking of my survival.
2711 := I know now that he was trying to recruit me into the Sith, but I couldn't have conceived of it back then. I argued with him and he got angry and he left. I never saw him again.
2712 := Saul was my mentor... he led us to so many victories against the Mandalorians, even when things looked to be at their worst.
2713 := I just... I couldn't conceive of it. He... he couldn't be serious. I was wrong, of course... he not only left us for the Sith, he... he gave them the codes to bypass our scanners.
2714 := I remember waking up as the first of the Sith bombers snuck past our defenses and began destroying half of our docked ships. I knew right away what had happened.
2715 := I... could have stopped him. I could have stopped it all.
2716 := Don't even start with that! I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel angry... at Saul and all those others. It's all I can think about sometimes!
2717 := I've fought Saul for years, now, and if I ever catch up to him... he will regret what he's done. He will regret it.
2718 := No. No, it's not.
2719 := But I don't want to talk about it right now. Let's go.
2720 := I don't know. Maybe. He might have killed me if I'd tried, or I might have killed him. I was stupid, however, and I let him go.
2721 := I blame Saul, not myself. I was... I was stupid and I ignored the danger. He nearly destroyed us all.
2722 := Cute. Nice to know that you're so full of concern. *Sigh* Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt, though I don't know why you're so interested.
2723 := Not particularly. I... guess it wouldn't hurt, exactly, either, though I don't know why you're so interested.
2724 := Oh? You want to argue some more, is that it?
2725 := And I don't really want to argue with you, either. You seem... sincere enough, I guess.
2726 := I just don't trust easily, and for good reasons... which are my own.
2727 := Ahhh, damn it. I suppose I won't get any rest until I talk, will I? You want to know why I don't trust anyone? Fine, here goes.
2728 := Five years ago the Jedi had just finished the war with the Mandalorians. Revan and Malak were heroes. I was damn proud to have served in their fleet.
2729 := It was completely unexpected when they turned on us, invading the Republic while we were still weak. Nobody knew what to think, least of all me.
2730 := Our heroes had become brutal, conquering Sith... and we were all but helpless before them. Think about it... if you can't even trust the best of the Jedi, who can you trust?
2731 := I... it wasn't even that. There were others: good, solid men. Trusted men who turned on us, as well, and joined their cause.
2732 := Malak and Revan and the Sith deserve to die for what they've done... but the ones who fled the Republic and joined them are even worse.
2733 := The dark side has nothing to do with why they joined with the Sith. They deserve no mercy!
2734 := I know. I... should apologize to you. I've become so accustomed to expecting the worst in others, and you've done nothing to deserve that.
2735 := It's just... never mind. Let's just continue with what we were doing. I'd rather not talk about it.
2736 := I... of course the Jedi turned to the dark side. There were others, however, who weren't Jedi. Good men... trusted men who joined them.
2737 := It... it's not that. It's... That's not what I mean. There were... there were others. Good, solid, trusted men who joined them.
2738 := What does it matter that much? Why can't you just leave it be?
2739 := So I've seen. If I were Malak I'd be a bit nervous to have you on my tail.
2740 := Ha! Can't say I've met a woman quite like you before. You're really something.
2741 := *Sigh* I knew you wouldn't understand where I was coming from. Let me try to explain.
2742 := You've got the skills of an elite commando, and you've saved my butt more than once. Between that and your facility with languages, I'm lucky you're here.
2743 := But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop watching you or being wary. I'm just not built that way. Period.
2744 := I don't know that, yet. Like I said before, it's probably nothing. But I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.
2745 := You, uh... haven't done anything *yet*. But there's no guarantee that you won't do anything in the future. I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again.
2746 := Maybe so. But I've been betrayed before by people I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.
2747 := Look... I'm not trying to insult you. This is just the way I am, no need to take it personally.
2748 := Yeah, well, you wouldn't be the first. Look... I don't expect you to be my friend. This is just the way I am, no need to take it personally.
2749 := I don't know that you'll betray me. But there are no guarantees... not for you, not for me. You don't have to take it personally.
2750 := Me?
2751 := I don't remember ever saying anything about "traitor". All I mean is that if you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.
2752 := You shouldn't. If you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila, and especially not yourself.
2753 := I... but I... it's just like a woman to try and turn things around.
2754 := Watch how relieved I am. We've more important things to do, anyway. Let's get them over with.
2755 := Don't get all proud of yourself. Let's just keep moving.
2756 := Well, you can stop wondering. I'm not.
2757 := Well stop wondering, sister. I'm not and I won't.
2758 := One you're not going to hear anytime soon. Let's just keep moving, shall we?
2759 := Hairless Wookiee? Alright, sister, just... just... just calm down before your head explodes.
2760 := Calm down there, princess. Your face is starting to turn purple.
2761 := I don't see what you're getting so excited over. We've got more important things to do than argue, anyway, so let's get it over with.
2762 := Cute. Let's just move on... we have more important things to do than argue.
2763 := Didn't we discuss this already? We were ambushed and outnumbered. Why do you think it crashed?
2764 := Neither was I, to tell the truth. I was onboard as an advisor for the most part. The battle began so fast, it's anyone's guess as to what actually happened.
2765 := I'm just trying to figure it out. I saw enough men lose their lives needlessly during the Mandalorian Wars. It's... difficult to see that happening all over again.
2766 := We lost the ship and a lot of good people... and for what? On the hope that Jedi powers would save us, somehow. Not that Bastila had much of an opportunity to act.
2767 := True. Bastila is as powerful as they say... she's the one who defeated Darth Revan, after all.
2768 := Hmm. I guess that no Jedi ability, no matter how powerful, makes up for being completely surprised and outmatched.
2769 := We didn't choose that battle, anyway. It got forced on us. Hell, I'm just surprised that any of us are alive to talk about it.
2770 := Come to think of it, it's more than a little surprising that you happen to be here, isn't it? Just what is your position with the Republic fleet, anyway?
2771 := Hell no... unless you consider that you were a last-minute addition to the crew roster and you just happen to be one of the survivors.
2772 := Well, that makes sense. Still... it seems a bit strange that someone who was a last-minute addition to the crew roster is one of the survivors.
2773 := A smuggler? I should have guessed. Isn't it odd, however, that a smuggler who was added to the crew at the last minute just happens to be alive?
2774 := Not at all. I just think it's a bit odd that someone who got added to the crew roster at the last minute just happens to be one of the survivors.
2775 := No. Well... maybe. Don't get me wrong, it just seems odd that someone Bastila's party specifically requested to transfer aboard happened to survive.
2776 := I'm not trying to be paranoid. It's just that I learned a long time ago that something which looks like a coincidence probably isn't. Especially when the Jedi are involved.
2777 := The Jedi requested numerous things when they came on board... hell, they practically took over the ship, as far as I could tell. 
2778 := Considering your connection to Bastila and the Jedi... whether you know it or not... your presence here seems a little convenient.
2779 := I'm probably wrong and this is probably nothing, I know. I learned a long time ago not to take things at face value, however. And I *hate* surprises.
2780 := You don't know the first thing about me and I don't know the first thing about you, and let's keep it that way for now, shall we?
2781 := If you say so. Let's just get back to it, then, shall we?
2782 := Fine. Let's do that.
2783 := I am working with you. I'd be a fool not to. I'd also be a fool not to expect the unexpected.
2784 := I expect you're right. I've got no real reason to suspect you of anything. Still... it's better to be safe than sorry, right?
2785 := I mean I have to expect the unexpected. Just to be safe.
2786 := You were the only one. Not to mention that Bastila's party was the one who requested your transfer.
2787 := Don't be ridiculous. You've more than proved yourself since the crash... we wouldn't have made it this far without you. But still...
2788 := Me? Well, I've been a star-pilot for the Republic for years. I've seen more than my share of wars... I fought in the Mandalorian Wars before all this started.
2789 := But with all that, I've never experienced anything like the slaughter these Sith animals can unleash. Not even the Mandalorians were that senseless.
2790 := My home world was one of the first planets to fall to Malak's fleet. The Sith bombed it into submission, and there wasn't a damn thing our Republic forces could do to stop them!
2791 := I'm just a soldier; I go where the fleet Admirals tell me to. I follow my orders and I do my duty. It just... *sigh* doesn't seem right that doing that means I failed them! I didn't!
2792 := It shouldn't be my fault. I did everything I could... I followed my orders and did my duty. That shouldn't mean I failed them! I didn't!
2793 := Yes. No... no, that's not what I mean. I mean... I'm sorry. I'm not making much sense, am I?
2794 := I'm more used to taking action... keeping my mind focused on the business at hand. So let's just do that. If you have more questions, ask them later.
2795 := There's nothing to talk about. I failed my son... just as I failed my wife. I thought that if I ever found him...
2796 := Well never mind what I thought. It's not important any more. Let's just... continue the mission. I want to pay these rail-rats back for what they did to him.
2797 := I think so. If he's anything like he used to be, Dustil hates to be tricked. There's no way he'll let the Sith trick him again.
2798 := As for whether or not he'll be my son again... I don't know. He's so full of anger and hate... I wasn't expecting him to be like this.
2799 := Maybe we can work it out. I hope so. I guess I'll have to wait and see. Thanks, by the way... for all your help.
2800 := I don't really know much about this place, sorry.
2801 := Korriban's a desolate world, and a Sith planet. There's only one small colony here, I'm pretty sure.
2802 := Kashyyyk is covered by a giant forest, I hear. Trees kilometers high. The Wookiees live on the higher branches, I think.
2803 := Tatooine's just a desert planet. I hear the mining isn't going so well... I'd bet the colony gets abandoned before long.
2804 := Manaan's a neutral world. They're the only source of kolto... the healing fluid... and they use that to remain free from both the Republic and the Sith.
2805 := Dantooine's a boring place. It's all plains and herders and small settlements. Perfect for the Jedi to lose themselves in, I guess.
2806 := Taris? The planet's all one big city... but it's golden years are long past, and things have gotten worse since the Sith occupied it.
2807 := From what I hear, the wealthy live on the tops of all the tall towers. And if you're poor, you live down in the shadows... and it gets worse the lower you go.
2808 := That's all I can think of, at any rate.
2809 := Sounds good to me.
2810 := Whatever you want.
2811 := What do you need?
2812 := Talk about what? The only thing I want to do right now is find Dustil. If he's alive... well, there's just nothing else I want to think about.
2813 := I'll understand if we can't look for him right now, but if we could it would be a huge load off my mind.
2814 := What do you need?
2815 := No. What I want is to find something... anything... that will convince Dustil that we're telling the truth.
2816 := There must be *something* here in the academy we can bring to him, something that would show him what the Sith really are!
2817 := Not right now. I think this datapad we found is the evidence we need. We have to bring it to Dustil right away.
2818 := Never mind.
2819 := I think it's time we talked about me being Revan, don't you?
2820 := And?
2821 := Why should I care if you hate me?
2822 := I'm glad to hear that.
2823 := Why can't you?
2824 := No, Carth. There's no room in my destiny for you.
2825 := I don't want you hurt protecting me, Carth.
2826 := What do you mean?
2827 := You think I could fall to the dark side, do you?
2828 := How could you possibly help me?
2829 := I'm sorry Carth. There's no room in my destiny for you.
2830 := What sort of reason?
2831 := I can't give you that chance. There can be no future between us.
2832 := I can't see into the future. I don't know what's going to happen.
2833 := I guess not. I think I could love you, too.
2834 := I think I could love you, too.
2835 := And if I make the wrong choice?
2836 := You look like you want to say something.
2837 := No, maybe later.
2838 := This is fine.
2839 := What's this about?
2840 := You think the Jedi have thrown me to the wolves?
2841 := Forget it, I said. I don't need you crowding me. Period.
2842 := Fine, Carth. Do what you have to.
2843 := Why are you doing this?
2844 := Fine. But this isn't personal.
2845 := Alright, Carth. I'd be glad for the help.
2846 := I haven't 'succumbed' to anything. What do you know?!
2847 := And just how are you supposed to protect me?
2848 := I can take care of myself. I don't need you.
2849 := You've been watching me very closely as of late. Why is that?
2850 := Well, I did.
2851 := Just keep your eyes to yourself from now on and leave me be, got that?
2852 := Oh? Any other observations?
2853 := It's alright. I don't mind if you watch me.
2854 := Is that it?
2855 := I mean is that how you ask for forgiveness?
2856 := Oh, this is too corny. Take a hike and leave me alone, will you?
2857 := You think I'm beautiful?
2858 := Well... that's certainly better...
2859 := You already apologized once, Carth.
2860 := That was rather like pulling teeth.
2861 := Forget it. You don't get off so easy.
2862 := Alright, you're off the hook. You're forgiven.
2863 := Why do you need my forgiveness, anyway?
2864 := So tell me... what happens if you ever get your revenge on Saul?
2865 := Yes. What happens afterwards?
2866 := But what if you don't die? What then?
2867 := Why? What kind of risks do you plan on taking?
2868 := I would certainly hope not.
2869 := How do I know that's the truth?
2870 := What are we doing here? Does it mean anything to you?
2871 := I don't know. What wouldn't you stop at to kill Saul?
2872 := Then I can't rely on you. You shouldn't have come.
2873 := I need your help, Carth. There's more than Saul to fight.
2874 := Well, you'll have to find something else to focus on.
2875 := You seem like you're far away. Is something wrong?
2876 := Out with it, Carth. I won't have you moping.
2877 := It doesn't seem like nothing.
2878 := Will you get over her, already? It's been four years!
2879 := No, it's not strange, Carth. You remember the important things.
2880 := Not only that, you're a fool. You're wasting your time on useless ghosts.
2881 := What I think shouldn't matter, Carth.
2882 := No, but I doubt your wife would want you to do this to yourself.
2883 := That's not going to help anything, Carth.
2884 := If we get the opportunity... then I promise.
2885 := Things may not work out that way. I can't promise that.
2886 := It does feel a little odd to discuss her, I admit.
2887 := What do you know about Revan and Malak?
2888 := How did they get away with all this?
2889 := Do you know why they turned to the dark side?
2890 := You knew them personally?
2891 := What do you know about the dark side?
2892 := I do what I want, and enjoy my power. Evil has nothing to do with it.
2893 := I'm not falling to the dark side, Carth, and I won't.
2894 := You don't know what you're talking about, Carth.
2895 := You think Bastila and I are evil?
2896 := I don't need you mothering me. Leave me alone from now on.
2897 := I can handle myself, Carth.
2898 := That's sweet. I didn't know you cared.
2899 := Tell me why you want revenge on Saul so badly.
2900 := Come on, Carth, you aren't fooling me.
2901 := It just seems to be more... personal than that, is all.
2902 := I asked, didn't I?
2903 := So what? Tough break. You haven't gotten over it yet?
2904 := That's terrible, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
2905 := So this is where all that anger comes from.
2906 := What was she like, your wife?
2907 := I didn't mean to pry.
2908 := Fair enough.
2909 := Thank you for telling me.
2910 := So what happened to your son? You didn't say.
2911 := Do you want to talk? You got pretty upset the last time we spoke.
2912 := We didn't end our last discussion very well...
2913 := Maybe if you pull yourself together you won't be so useless.
2914 := Why don't you return to the front lines, then?
2915 := And how does that excuse your actions?
2916 := Don't worry about it, Carth.
2917 := You sure have.
2918 := Not really. I couldn't care less what you think.
2919 := No, I won't. Just keep quiet and do what you're told from now on.
2920 := Only if you agree to work with me, for once.
2921 := You've been very quiet, lately, you know that?
2922 := Oh, poor baby. You need filling in on some detail?
2923 := I'm not the one leaving you out of the loop, Carth.
2924 := Left out of the loop? I don't understand.
2925 := They thought it was more important that I help find the Star Maps than stay.
2926 := It's none of your business, frankly.
2927 := Get ahold of yourself. I'm sick of your paranoia.
2928 := Isn't that the point? Aren't we all in this together?
2929 := Why should anything the Jedi do seem strange to you?
2930 := I've done pretty well so far.
2931 := They said there's a bond between Bastila and myself.
2932 := Bastila and I have a bond. We have to do this together. That's all I'm going to say.
2933 := I'm sick of listening to you rant! Why don't *you* leave?!
2934 := I'm here and that's not going to change. Get over it.
2935 := Are you saying I'm not needed?
2936 := I am *sick* of listening to this. Just shut up or leave!
2937 := And just what are you going to do about it?
2938 := I am *not* going to betray you! I am *not* Saul!
2939 := I want to continue our discussion from before.
2940 := I think you owe me an explanation, Carth.
2941 := You say that name like I should know it.
2942 := You didn't think he would betray the Republic?
2943 := And that's why you feel so sorry for yourself?
2944 := So that's all of it, then?
2945 := Do you really believe that?
2946 := So you blame yourself for trusting your friend?
2947 := Yes, but I'm bored, so spit it out.
2948 := Don't you think you'd feel better if you discussed it?
2949 := I just want to talk with you.
2950 := No, I don't want to argue with you.
2951 := Fine. You can stuff your reasons, then.
2952 := I suppose you can't. That must have been hard to take.
2953 := I haven't joined the Sith, Carth.
2954 := You say that with such... hatred.
2955 := They turned to the dark side, obviously. Why is it so personal?
2956 := What do I have to do with Malak and Revan?
2957 := What reasons? I want to know.
2958 := But we have to work together, Carth, so it has plenty to do with me.
2959 := I just want to know why you distrust me so much.
2960 := I'm always up for a good fight.
2961 := I want to discuss something with you.
2962 := And what, exactly, are you watching me for?
2963 := Why are you so hostile? What did I do to deserve this?
2964 := Not built that way? That sounds like an excuse.
2965 := Of course it won't happen again if you never trust anyone!
2966 := I'm starting to get pretty tired of this attitude of yours.
2967 := So you want some guarantee that I won't betray you?!
2968 := Right. And how am I supposed to know that *you* won't betray us?
2969 := Why not you? Accusing other people is a good cover for a traitor.
2970 := Yes, you! Why should I trust you, after all?
2971 := Great. Let's keep moving, then.
2972 := You sound less convinced.
2973 := I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
2974 := What's the matter, Carth? Lose your chain of thought?
2975 := I'm beginning to wonder if you're even capable of trusting anyone.
2976 := I'm willing to bet there's a story behind this.
2977 := You're a sad case, Carth.
2978 := Don't tell me not to take it personally, you hairless Wookiee!
2979 := Just keep your distance, Carth.
2980 := I'm not going to stand here and be insulted!
2981 := Keep it up, and you'll be turning black and blue.
2982 := Is this a good time to ask you some more questions?
2983 := I wasn't in a position to know what was going on, really.
2984 := Why ask me? I don't see the point.
2985 := Like you said when we first met: Bastila didn't have time to use her powers.
2986 := I'm just a soldier. I'm sure there isn't anything unusual about that, is there?
2987 := I'm a scout. I was recruited into the fleet for my skills, if you must know.
2988 := I used to be a smuggler, if you must know. I was recruited into the fleet for my knowledge.
2989 := Why? Are you accusing me of something?
2990 := Are you implying *I* had something to do with the crash?
2991 := It doesn't make any difference. Go ahead and be paranoid.
2992 := Why would Bastila request my transfer?
2993 := Are you sure it's me you're angry at?
2994 := Try something and it'll be the last mistake you make.
2995 := Don't be such a fool! We're on the same side!
2996 := Fine. Let's just get back to something important, then.
2997 := Shouldn't we be trying to work together?
2998 := I'm telling you, Carth, I had nothing to do with the crash.
2999 := What do you mean by surprises?
3000 := I have no idea what you're talking about!
3001 := What's so odd about me being added to the crew at the last minute?
3002 := You'd rather I wasn't?
3003 := I'd like to know some more about you, Carth.
3004 := Calm down. I was just asking.
3005 := I'm sorry, Carth. This must be very painful for you.
3006 := You're talking like it's your fault. Like you failed somehow.
3007 := Hey, why are you getting so mad at me? It's not like this was my fault!
3008 := I'm sorry, Carth. I didn't mean to upset you.
3009 := Them? Do you mean the people of your home world?
3010 := Do you want to talk about it?
3011 := Do you think you'll see Dustil again?
3012 := Do you know anything about this place? 
3013 := I want you to rejoin the party.
3014 := I want to switch you with another party member.
3015 := Do you want to talk?
3016 := Do you want to talk?
3017 := Excuse me, have you seen a mechanic about? Short fellow, bald. I've been looking --
3018 := Well, I'll be a Wookiee's uncle. Davin! Davin Kotras!
3019 := Ha! Jolee? Jolee Bindo? Why, you old freak! Last time I saw you, you were still wandering the galaxy in that old tug. I thought you were dead, old man.
3020 := I crashed somewhere and decided to stay. Heh heh.
3021 := Yeah, yeah, I'll just bet. Damn, old man, you look exactly the same as the last time I saw you! You pickle well.
3022 := You're too kind. Not the young lad anymore yourself, I see.
3023 := What, are you deaf? His name's Davin. Old friend from my wanderer days. By the by, Davin, I really should be running off...
3024 := Of course, old man. Oh, wait... if you've been traveling in this sector, I suppose you heard about Sunry?
3025 := No. Why? What's there to hear?
3026 := He's been picked up by the Selkath authorities on Manaan. For murder.
3027 := That's preposterous.
3028 := I know. Elora is beside herself, as you can imagine. Maybe you could help them? I'm sure Sunry would appreciate a Jedi's assistance right about now.
3029 := Perhaps I will at that. It's up to my friend, here, actually. I'm just tagging along.
3030 := Perhaps I will at that. It's up to my old friend, here, actually. I'm just tagging along.
3031 := I was expecting that. Still... if we get the chance, I'd be grateful. Sunry's an old friend... I'd hate to see him hurt.
3032 := I'd appreciate that. Sunry's an old friend... I'd hate to see him hurt.
3033 := Same here. Well, heh, it was good to see you again. Give my regards to Elora, if you see her.
3034 := I will. Be safe, old friend.
3035 := He's been picked up by the Selkath authorities here on Manaan. For murder.
3036 := Yes, yes, right you are. Sorry, Davin, but duty calls. Maybe I'll run into you again soon.
3037 := Care to introduce your friend, Jolee?
3038 := We could check into it when we're on Manaan next.
3039 := I'm not making any promises.
3040 := We have more important things to do.
3041 := We're on Manaan already. We could certainly check it out.
3042 := We don't have time for reunions.
3043 := Jolee, we should be going...
3044 := Statement: I cannot be of assistance on that, master.
3045 := Statement: I have little knowledge of that to impart, master.
3046 := Statement: HK-47 is ready to serve, master.
3047 := As you desire, master. Signing off.
3048 := Statement: Certainly, master. Allow me to input the proper sequences into the ship computer. I caution you that the simulation will appear quite real.
3049 := Are you ready to begin the training sequence, master?
3050 := Statement: Simulation initiating.
3051 := Affirmative: If you believe your skills are up to the task, master, then I can certainly guide you through the process.
3052 := Request: I only ask that you be oh so very careful, master. I am too valuable and well-crafted to perish at the hands of ineptitude.
3053 := As you desire, master. I cannot help but claim a small amount of relief. Signing off.
3054 := [Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. You are already familiar with accessing my central control cluster, correct? Now you will need to...
3055 := [Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. The first stage is the simple one, and that is accessing my central control cluster. This may take awhile. First you will need to open three panels...
3056 := [Failure] ...now close the last panel. Hmmm... I am afraid the operation did not succeed, master, though it was a valiant attempt for a meatbag.
3057 := Supplication: Perhaps it would be best if you desisted your efforts for the moment, meatb-- I mean master. This seems to be going nowhere.
3058 := [Failure] ...but I *need* those circuits, master. Please, master... do not destroy my chips out of frustration. Calm yourself, I implore you.
3059 := [Failure] ...aahhhh! What are you doing?! Remove the arc wrench, remove the arc wrench! Medic!
3060 := [Failure] ...no, no, no. This is no good, master. You have nearly detonated my thermal core three times in a matter of minutes.
3061 := [Failure] ...no, that is not it, master. No... that is not it, either. *sigh* That is a hinge, master.
3062 := [Failure] ...err, you've shorted out something, master, but it has nothing to do with my memory. Ow! I am poking my own eye sockets! Ow! Stop!
3063 := [Failure] ...no, no! What are you doing, master! That is my motor core! Stop! Ahhhh!
3064 := [Success] ...and now re-wire the last three relays... yes, good. Well done, master. I believe your operation was a success. Accessing new memory...
3065 := Access complete: I have recovered the last of my deleted memory, master. Unfortunately, my history is still not complete.
3066 := Answer: As I did inform you, master, the majority of my memory is still locked within my core. That can only be accessed by the appropriate stimuli.
3067 := And I have no idea what that stimuli might be, unfortunately. Sadly, it seems my true origins will always be a mystery.
3068 := Correction: That would actually be my first owner, master. The first I can remember.
3069 := I had completed an assassination in Mandalorian space... though I have no knowledge of what my target was or who sent me.
3070 := Regardless, my motor function had been damaged and I could not return to wherever I had been sent from. A Mandalorian soldier claimed me as 'booty', I believe.
3071 := He repaired me... poorly, I might add... and proceeded to use my assassination protocol to raise his rank.
3072 := Observation: *You* found me, master. Perhaps you are simply fortunate that my assassination protocol no longer functions?
3073 := At any rate, it seems that my Mandalorian owner finally decided to send me against Mandalore, himself. My poorest performance, sadly.
3074 := Answer: I was captured by this Mandalore during the attempt. He was able to reverse my programming and send me after my own master.
3075 := It was quite distressing. There was little I could do. Needless to say, I dispatched the Mandalorian soldier efficiently.
3076 := Once I deactivated, I believe I eventually ended up on the black market and was sold to the Hutt on Sleheyron. *sigh* My darkest day.
3077 := Statement: With all due respect, master, he *is* the leader of the Mandalorians. Perhaps my old master was foolish to send me after him.
3078 := Objection: That is so unfair, master! Have I not brought you a great deal of satisfaction?
3079 := Statement: You are a very harsh master, master. I like you.
3080 := Statement: So I did. I am not very proud of that, master. The soldier seemed very startled, I must say.
3081 := Answer: There are a few Mandalorian implants that I can activate, now. They will improve my performance.
3082 := Beyond that, master, there is nothing more I can relate to you. With luck, we will discover the stimulus to unlock my core very soon.
3083 := Answer: Such knowledge is locked within my core, master, as I said. There is no way to withdraw it otherwise.
3084 := Query: Do you not have enemies that you would desire eliminated, master? If my protocol still worked, would you not use it?
3085 := Statement: See? I provide a function that is useful to others. They merely must learn to use it properly, I believe.
3086 := Statement: If you say so, master.
3087 := Query: Wouldn't you be, master? Here I am, surrounded by all these meatbags and all I desire is true perfection.
3088 := Surely there are more droids like me out there, or is that too much to hope?
3089 := Objection: Oh, fine. Laugh at me, master. Humiliate your pet droid, go ahead.
3090 := Observation: If it was, master, your restorations will certainly have ensured that the proper stimulus restores my core's functions.
3091 := Sadly, that could have already happened and we missed it, and my core was too damaged to activate. Oh, woe is me.
3092 := Access complete: I have accessed information on my owner prior to the senator, master. Most... unexpected.
3093 := Answer: It appears that previous to my ownership by the senator, I was the property of one Bochaba the Hutt on the planet Sleheyron.
3094 := Answer: It does not appear so. Or, at least, Bochaba was not my first owner. He purchased me from somewhere else.
3095 := Hmm. My memories tell me that, for a time, Bochaba was one of the most feared gangsters on Sleheyron. I helped him with this reputation greatly.
3096 := Over a span of one year, I terminated a grand total of 322 sentient meatbags. These contracts made Bochoba very wealthy.
3097 := Statement: Should I, master? I had no reason to terminate those targets, it was not my decision. I am the weapon, not the wielder.
3098 := Answer: That is correct, master. I do enjoy my work, though my past owners have enjoyed utilizing my functions far more.
3099 := Strictly speaking, one meatbag is the same as another. Anything I do is in support of my master.
3100 := It was unfortunate but inevitable that eventually Bochaba would overstep his bounds. I had just cleared two Hutt households when the Exchange retaliated.
3101 := Statement: I was not even present when my old master was assassinated. I did appreciate the artistry behind his demise upon my return, however.
3102 := Observation: Indeed. Perhaps it is better that my assassination function is inoperable, master, yes?
3103 := I am like a veritable fable, warning against the karma caused by murdering others. A morality tale, if you will. What utter irony.
3104 := At any rate, I quickly shut down upon my master's death. The rival Hutt claimed me along with my master's other possessions.
3105 := Observation: If that Hutt had only known my true function, he surely would not have sold me to a senator he bribed regularly.
3106 := Supplication: Please, master, have I not pleased you? I cannot control the acts I have performed... perhaps that is why memory is erased?
3107 := At any rate, I act only as you instruct me... even if that means being... *gulp* ...non-violent.
3108 := Affirmation: HK-47 exists only to serve, master.
3109 := Observation: No doubt, master. It would have been a glorious battle to end my existence with. I would prefer that to rusting on a junk heap.
3110 := Observation: It would have suited my character, master. I have enjoyed my existence since, more or less, so I do not miss it.
3111 := Answer: Negative, master. There is still more memory that can be restored, however, if you wish to try.
3112 := As well, I believe I can restore several programs the Hutt installed to improve my performance. Yesss... they are now active.
3113 := Contemplative: I wonder how many more dead masters I might have out there. A droid can live for a long time, you know.
3114 := Observation: According to your own meatbag values, was my master not a heartless gangster and murderer? I will mourn you when you perish, master.
3115 := Amendment: *If* you perish. So far I am three out of three, remember, through little fault of my own.
3116 := Answer: Allow me to say that I have little doubt that residents of that sector were fishing pieces of Bochaba out of their soup for weeks afterward.
3117 := Statement: So it appears, master. A rather suitable occupation, would you not agree?
3118 := Objection: That is unfair, master. While Bochaba may have died gruesomely, I most certainly had nothing to do with it. Well... very little.
3119 := Access complete: I have recovered information on my owner previous to the commercial officer, master. Intriguing.
3120 := Statement: It appears that my previous owner was a human senator on the planet Coruscant. A man of importance who obviously appreciated quality craftsmanship.
3121 := Observation: It does seem that way, does it not? I can still remember all the glittering lights of Coruscant. Very pretty. Can we go back there, master?
3122 := I do remember that I was very pleased to be the property of a senator. One of his assistants discovered my assassination functions later through questioning.
3123 := The assistant was quite alarmed and told the senator I should be scrapped quickly to avoid a scandal. Naturally the senator had me eliminate the fool.
3124 := Answer: Unfortunately so, master. While he lived, however, I maintained a most useful existence.
3125 := I was most proud to have partaken in the political system of the galaxy. During the time my owner possessed me, he gained significant rank.
3126 := Given time, I believe he could have become Chancellor. I even eliminated a few key opponents that he did not ask for... freebies, if you will.
3127 := Answer: There are a *lot* of politicians on Coruscant, master. I could spend decades slaughtering them and still not make a dent.
3128 := And it is not as if I walked into the Senate chambers with a carbonite explosive. I was very discrete. My best work to date... that I can remember.
3129 := Answer: Certainly. Why not? I am an intelligent droid, you know. I see an opportunity and I take it... and my master was most pleased with my work.
3130 := Observation: I think he would have done far better had he not allowed his use of me to become personal. He set me on his wife.
3131 := Answer: I am unsure. The human was most agitated and angry. I believe his wife had done something that had displeased him greatly.
3132 := I was to go to their summer estate and terminate his wife... along with whatever male companion I discovered there.
3133 := I journeyed to the southern continent, but it appeared my master was not far behind me. Apparently he regretted his activation of the protocol.
3134 := When I found the wife and her companion, I proceeded to launch my attack... but my master interposed his own body and was destroyed.
3135 := It was rather a strange meatbag thing to do, do you not agree? Naturally I shut myself down, my master being terminated.
3136 := Observation: I find that unlikely. Perhaps he was more concerned that the death of his wife would be more likely traced back to him.
3137 := Statement: I believe the senator's wife was unsure what I was or what to do with me. It was she who sold me to the corporate officer, an acquaintance.
3138 := Observation: Only so far, master. There are still more memories not recovered, remember?
3139 := Answer: As previously, I have found a few more programs which will enhance my performance. A most gratifying discovery, in fact.
3140 := There is still nothing from previous memories uncovered. You will have to operate again if you desire to find them.
3141 := With luck, I will discover the stimulus to unlock my core and all this will be unnecessary. I do thank you for the attempt, however, master.
3142 := Observation: I *am* a droid, master, with programming. Even if I did not enjoy killing, I would have no choice. Thankfully I enjoy it very much.
3143 := Statement: I have no idea, master. Cheating seems to be a relevant term only when one is caught in the act. Otherwise it is viewed as intelligence, no?
3144 := Observation: I rather liked the human, myself. For a meatbag, his priorities were in the right place. I felt most useful.
3145 := Observation: Senators are not nice, master. They are either on top of the game or yesterday's news. My master told me that frequently, you see.
3146 := Answer: It does not seem so, master, no. He required a protocol droid only and wanted one as cheaply as possible. I do not know who sold me to him.
3147 := Answer: I am unsure, master. Any knowledge of my owner prior to him is still deleted. The senator did assume I was a protocol droid, however.
3148 := Access complete: I have restored a great deal of information about my previous owner, master. Would you like to hear it?
3149 := Recitation: The earliest memory of my last owner specifies that he was human, a low-ranking commercial officer for Systech Corporation.
3150 := I am unaware of his designation. He puchased me from an acquaintance I cannot identify, for the purposes of protocol and bodyguard duties.
3151 := Explanation: Affirmative, master. I had assumed that my previous owner was the corporation, itself. This is not the case. The human purchased me privately.
3152 := Observation: Not that I could perceive, master. The human believed that accompaniment by a bodyguard droid would increase his importance in the perception of others.
3153 := Explanation: That previous owner is part of memories that are still deleted, master. It is customary for a droid's memory to be wiped when it is sold.
3154 := Answer: Negative, master. The human was terminated by this HK-47 unit prior to system shut-down.
3155 := Explanation: My former master had owned me for a duration of two standard months before discovering my assassination protocol. He was pleased by the discovery.
3156 := The human informed me that a competitor corporation was preparing to market a product that would ruin him personally. He was most agitated.
3157 := He activated my assassination protocol and instructed me to kill all those responsible for the competing product. I proceeded to carry out my order.
3158 := My former master was unaware of this, but the competitor was in fact an arm of Systech Corporation, my master's own employer.
3159 := It did not take long for my master to realize his mistake. By then, I had already terminated 104 corporate officers.
3160 := Statement: It was nothing, really, master. The majority of them were not even expecting it, and I move very quickly.
3161 := I do not know why my master was so upset, really. He was an officer of Systech and a potential target, but I cannot terminate my own master.
3162 := I would assume that being the sole officer remaining, he would surely be promoted. Instead, however, the human chose to go insane with rage and attack me.
3163 := Objection: Naturally not, master! As I said, I am incapable of purposefully terminating my owner. That would not be allowed.
3164 := My master was not a smart man, however. While he was screaming and stabbing me with a writing utensil, he managed to pierce one of my actuators.
3165 := The resulting shock terminated him and, sadly, destroyed my assassination protocol. Pure luck on his part, I suspect.
3166 := Statement: I was only doing as I was told, master. I would have told the human the proper codes to deactivate my protocol, had he asked.
3167 := I shut down immediately whenever my master dies. I can only assume that while I was shut down Systech was dismantled and I was auctioned off as former corporate property.
3168 := Observation: No doubt my sale price was quite cheap, leading to Yuka Laka's purchase. How very demeaning.
3169 := Assessment: I do not believe so, master. It would require complete dismantlement of my chassis... a most involved procedure.
3170 := Observation: So am I, master, though I apologize for not having an assassination mode to offer you.
3171 := Statement: That hurts, master. This is my life you are talking about.
3172 := Statement: How could they? The vast majority of the officers had already been terminated. They likely assumed I was mere... chattel.
3173 := I have recovered knowledge of some other actuators which will enhance my performance, master. I will activate them now.
3174 := But as for my own history... negative. It will require further effort on your part to restore them, if you wish... though certain stimuli could always restore my core, still, as I explained.
3175 := For now, please excuse me, master. I wish to meditate upon the face of my former meatbag master as he was electrocuted. I find it most soothing.
3176 := Observation: Effectively, yes. This is a most pleasing memory, master. Thank you for recovering it.
3177 := Query: Do you know what the chances are of puncturing that sole actuator? I would have congratulated my master were he not sizzling and incoherent at the time.
3178 := Answer: I was not present to be deactivated, master. Part of my protocol is not to return to my master until my function is complete. I still had 15 officers to go.
3179 := Observation: While it may have been unintentional, my master's wording of his orders left little room for me. Systech was responsible for the product, after all.
3180 := Information: This HK-47 unit is complete with a protocol that, when invoked, will set me to independently carry out a termination.
3181 := I will go to whatever lengths, travel whatever distances are required, to complete the termination. This is the reason for my combat skills.
3182 := Advisement: Unfortunately, the assassination protocol is currently non-functional. You will not be able to activate it.
3183 := Answer: several of my actuators were damaged by my former owner. They cannot be repaired, master, sad though that is.
3184 := Affirmative, master, though I had not been programmed to do so. The human's termination was accidental.
3185 := Negatory: Err... no, master. You are not a droid, however, and therefore your skills *are* limited by the physical capabilities of your meatbag extremities. Or somesuch.
3186 := Appeasement: Yes, master. Of course, master. Could we begin?
3187 := Negatory: I believe that there are no further deleted memories which can be safely retrieved, master. All earlier memories reside in my core.
3188 := Those are protected by my safeguards and would be far too dangerous to access.
3189 := The only way those memories could be obtained is through the proper stimulus... whatever that might be. I am sorry, master.
3190 := Commentary: That is unnecessary now, master. I have been returned to you and my memory core is now fully functional.
3191 := Statement: Yes, master. You created me shortly after you and your apprentice began your war to conquer the galaxy.
3192 := I was sent on an assassination mission into Mandalorian space, but I was damaged and unable to return to you.
3193 := Exclamation: I find this most distressing. I could certainly have protected you from the Jedi and your pupil's betrayal had I returned.
3194 := Statement: Of course, master. You are the one who created me, meatbag or no... and while you may not be all you once were, I am grateful for my existence.
3195 := Answer: It was you who programmed me thus, master.
3196 := Your pupil once asked what I thought of him and I informed him of his meatbag status. He was unimpressed, but you found the reference humorous.
3197 := You changed my programming so that I would continue to use the term. It drove your pupil to extreme lengths of frustration.
3198 := Observation: Of course you do, master. You did then, as well.
3199 := Commentary: Your former pupil is efficient and brutal, even for an organic. I rather liked him when you first introduced me to him.
3200 := If I had known what he would do to you, master, I would have gladly removed his entrails right then!
3201 := Answer: No, master. You never did make me privy to any of the Star Forge's secrets.
3202 := Observation: You are different in many fundamental ways, master. You have a concern for life that is unsettling.
3203 := This cannot solely be caused by memory loss. I do not know how to explain it. Regardless, you do seem to be improved, overall, from the human I once knew.
3204 := Observation: In many ways you are, master, yes. You have much of the beloved cruelty of the master I knew.
3205 := You seem to have forgotten much, but in some ways you seem improved from the human I once knew. It is... difficult to explain, master.
3206 := Objection: But I would have tried, master! I could have killed the Jedi, Bastila, I am sure of it. That would have been most fun.
3207 := Observation: Now that is the master I remember.
3208 := Retraction: I apologize, master. It is a force of habit.
3209 := Observation: You may be right, master. This way we are reunited, and neither of us has suffered permanent termination.
3210 := Query: Don't I? I was under the assumption that organic meatbags such as yourself enjoyed such forms of address.
3211 := Qualification: You *are* my master, master. Did you not purchase me legitimately? Am I stolen goods? Shall I report myself to the authorities?
3212 := Explanation: If I was to be stolen somehow, I would be forced to turn myself into sector authorities. This programming was added to my system months ago.
3213 := Explanation: Then you qualify as my master and I must refer to you as such. The legal requirements for models of my type are very specific, master.
3214 := Answer: Simply that the distinction between 'killer' and 'killee' be a clear one. I cannot kill of my own volition, naturally.
3215 := Answer: Certainly not, master! You may not value your own existence, but I certainly do! They melt down droids that belong to criminals, you know.
3216 := Answer: Why you are, master. I thought that was obvious.
3217 := Commentary: A blaster is such a primitive comparison... but essentially you have it correct, yes.
3218 := Expletive: Damn it, master, I am an assassination droid... not a dictionary!
3219 := Evasion: Oh... the illegal kind of model, master... you know...
3220 := Answer: More than there are for legal models, apparently. That is meatbag logic for you.
3221 := Query: Would you rather be caught with contraband that is *very* illegal or just a little illegal?
3222 := Answer: About 20 years, master.
3223 := Agreement: This was my thought as well, master. You show excellent logical skills... for a meatbag.
3224 := Apology: Sorry, master. My optical sensors simply pick up all the water sloshing about inside your flesh coating. It is... unpleasant.
3225 := Commentary: Organic meatbags have such delicate staminas. Perhaps you should consider some cybernetic implants, master.
3226 := Apology: I am afraid I cannot comply with your command, master, as much as I would like to.
3227 := Commentary: How would you like to be the wholly-owned servant to an organic meatbag. It's demeaning! If, uh, you weren't one yourself, I mean...
3228 := Qualification: Err... perhaps I did not mean it *quite* like that, master. I mean... while an artificial life-form is superior...
3229 := Commentary: Yes, master. Did I ever tell you how much I enjoy killing for you, master?
3230 := Commentary: I mean... nice human, goo-oood human...
3231 := Explanation: Someone has hard-coded it into my system that my current master always be addressed as such.
3232 := Objection: I would not advise that, master. There are safeguards present that... well, it should suffice to say that my systems have been altered plenty already.
3233 := Answer: electrical protection systems, mostly. They are at lethal levels, however, master... only the best for your droid.
3234 := Answer: Considerably. Several of my systems do not match their imbedded parameters. I have no memory of such alterations, however, or their purpose.
3235 := Conjecture: I do not know... some organic meatbag?
3236 := Observation: I can hardly be blamed for my programming, master. Do not worry... I am still well-capable of killing most anything for you.
3237 := Commentary: That is a very clever turn of phrase, master. Your brain is very un-meatbag-like.
3238 := Answer: No, master. My past memory has been almost completely erased prior to your purchase of me.
3239 := Observation: At certain times, power re-routing forces some memory circuits to fire that were previously deleted. I cannot control this process, however.
3240 := Answer: Because there has been considerable tampering with my systems, master.
3241 := Statement: I will endeavour to do so, master.
3242 := Retraction: Did I say that out loud? I apologize, master. While you are a meatbag, I suppose I should not call you such.
3243 := Amendment: Then I will endeavour not to refer to you by your meatbag status in the future, master. Does that suffice?
3244 := Query: I am confused. 'No' you do wish to be referred to as meatbag or 'no' it does not suffice?
3245 := Answer: Deliberation implies some form of intent, master, when I am only stating a fact. Perhaps you would prefer the term liquidious fleshbag?
3246 := Objection: But... but that technical term does not accurately portray the vast amount of bulbous slushiness present in your bipedal form!
3247 := Resignation: You have no idea, master. No idea at all. Can we please go and shoot something now?
3248 := Resignation: *sigh* Very well, master. You are a harsh, harsh taskmaster. I like you more already.
3249 := Observation: Well, the only other possibility is to alter your meatbag status. Are you up for an array of cybernetic implants, perhaps?
3250 := Statement: Then there is nothing I can do, master. You have my abject apologies for your condition. *sigh*
3251 := Objection: But Master! Am I not far too useful to be thrown aside in such a casual manner? Can I be faulted for my perfect artificial construction?
3252 := Analysis: Reference: 'lippy'... argumentative, disputatious, contentious, quarrelsome. What?! I must object, master, this is untrue!
3253 := Explanation: It's my combative nature, master. I cannot help myself. I'll make it up to you... allow me to kill something in your honor!
3254 := Observation: Neither are you, master. For an organic meatbag.
3255 := Correction: Err... fluid-filled biped? Watery flesh-sentient? I'll, uh, work on it, master...
3256 := Answer: Even a droid has to be allowed a little fun once in a while, master.
3257 := Explanation: It's just that... you have all these squishy parts, master. And all that water! How the constant sloshing doesn't drive you mad, I have no idea...
3258 := Observation: Organics have no sense of persistence.
3259 := Err... ignore that, master. Obeying original command. Signing off.
3260 := Objection: Surely not, master. I am programmed to perform all kinds of psychological assistance. Do you require some?
3261 := Statement: Now do you understand the travails of my existence, master? Surely it does not compare to your existence, but still...
3262 := Commentary: As do I. It is our lot in life, I suppose, master. Shall we find something to kill to cheer ourselves up?
3263 := Commentary: Of course I do, master. You are Revan... you are my master, the one who created me. I exist to serve.
3264 := Statement: I know some elements of my functionality, master, but not all.
3265 := Answer: I believe I have been damaged several times in the past, master. I have always been repaired... but perhaps full functionality has not been restored.
3266 := Answer: Some of my motor functions can be safely repaired, master... but anything in relation to my memory core is extremely sensitive.
3267 := I have safeguards installed to protect that core that I cannot de-activate. It is not impossible that other, lesser, memory functions could be restored, however.
3268 := Answer: You may attempt to restore portions of my deleted memory, master, but some skill at repair is required.
3269 := The deeper functions of my core memory, however, would still be unadvisable to tamper with.
3270 := Conjecture: It is possible that some external stimulus might result in the memory core being reactivated... but I am unaware of any program existence to do so.
3271 := Answer: Simply tell me that you wish to make the attempt, master, and I will attempt to walk you through it. Please do be careful.
3272 := Conjecture: There may be hidden programming that awaits certain conditions to reactivate my memory core, master... but there is no way to know.
3273 := It is quite possible that tampering has simply erased my core permanently. If that is so, a meatbag will surely pay!
3274 := Observation: I am sure that you are aware of the majority of my skills, master. I can handle various sorts of heavy weaponry with ease.
3275 := My physical abilities are well-above those of your average meatbag, as are my sensor functions... an assassin if you would.
3276 := Answer: I have internal replication systems that can produce a small quantity of explosive material... enough for a small grenade, if you wish.
3277 := It would take time for me to replicate enough material for each grenade, but you have only to ask, master.
3278 := Caution: Shhhh, master! Such a function in a droid is highly illegal.
3279 := Commentary: Good, for I would truly hate to be turned into spare scrap, master. That would be a waste of my genius engineering.
3280 := Answer: My assassination functions are currently non-functional, having been de-activated by the meatbag Yuka Laka on Tatooine.
3281 := Were they functional, you as my master would be able to specify a target and I would operate independently to the best of my ability to terminate it.
3282 := Observation: If you say so, master. I imagine it was truly a work of art to see me in action, however.
3283 := Answer: I have no way of knowing that, master. My memory has been deleted, remember?
3284 := Answer: Not that I know of, master. I still possess all my normal combat and stealth abilities, however.
3285 := Answer: There have been numerous repairs and tampering made to my system, master. Several systems are not operating as they should be.
3286 := The fact that my memory is incomplete may be due to meatbag incompetence... or something else I am unaware of.
3287 := Qualification: I suspected that it might, master. But without memory, I had no way of knowing whether or not I knew that was true.
3288 := Qualification: Err... not so much, master. I spoke out of ignorance. I assumed the Ithorian was responsible for my memory loss.
3289 := That does not mean I am not a fully loyal droid willing to serve its master. Right... master?
3290 := Statement: My functionality has now been fully restored, master. I exist to serve Revan as your personal battle droid.
3291 := In time, my assassination protocol can be restored... and at that point I will once again endeavour to eliminate any meatbag opposition you may have.
3292 := As you desire, master.
3293 := As you desire, master.
3294 := That will be all, HK-47.
3295 := I want to begin a fighter simulation.
3296 := No, forget it.
3297 := Go ahead.
3298 := I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
3299 := I'll try later.
3300 := Let's get started.
3301 := Very well. We'll do this later.
3302 := I want to try again.
3303 := What? Why not?
3304 := So tell me about this last owner, then.
3305 := Does nobody decent ever find you?
3306 := Oh? Why is that?
3307 := So you couldn't kill Mandalore, hey?
3308 := You are just a traveling piece of bad luck, aren't you?
3309 := You don't want to hear the answer to that.
3310 := So you killed *that* master directly.
3311 := So can you remember anything else?
3312 := So there is no way to find out who sent you there originally?
3313 := It appears no-one could resist using your protocol.
3314 := I suppose I would, at that.
3315 := That's different.
3316 := No, of course not.
3317 := You are eager to find your origins, are you?
3318 := Well...
3319 := Are you sure your core isn't just damaged?
3320 := What now?
3321 := That makes sense. Did the Hutts build you?
3322 := Don't you care about all those lives lost?
3323 := But you *have* killed on your own accord before.
3324 := You sound proud of that carnage.
3325 := And so what happened to stop that?
3326 := So another master gone because of you.
3327 := No doubt.
3328 := I should dismantle you!
3329 := How very self-sacrificing of you.
3330 := You would have been found out eventually.
3331 := You would have preferred to stay on Sleheyron?
3332 := Do you remember anything else?
3333 := That's terrible. You don't even mourn your master?
3334 := When I perish?
3335 := Why? How was he killed?
3336 := So you were a gangster's assassin droid?
3337 := And what gruesome fate awaited him?
3338 := What's so intriguing?
3339 := It seems you've been around, HK.
3340 := I hope this man is dead, right?
3341 := And nobody figured out what he was up to?
3342 := So he just killed all his opponents?
3343 := You can do that?
3344 := And why would he do that?
3345 := And did you?
3346 := Well, it appeared he got a conscience at the end.
3347 := What happened to you then?
3348 := So that's two out of two masters killed.
3349 := Have you recovered any other memories?
3350 := So you just kill anyone you're told?
3351 := So his wife was cheating on him.
3352 := Sounds like my kind of guy.
3353 := So we're not talking about a nice senator, I see.
3354 := Did this senator know about your assassination function?
3355 := And how did he get ahold of you?
3356 := Yes, let me hear it.
3357 := You mentioned this Systech Corporation when I purchased you.
3358 := This man needed a bodyguard?
3359 := Why can't you identify his acquaintance?
3360 := This man... is he still alive?
3361 := Why? What happened?
3362 := And how did that result in his death?
3363 := You killed 104 people?!
3364 := And that's when you killed him?
3365 := Well, it *was* his own fault.
3366 := Are you sure this actuator can't be fixed?
3367 := I'm just glad I acquired you myself.
3368 := What a horrible story!
3369 := Didn't they know what you had done?
3370 := Did you recover any other memories?
3371 := So you destroyed his life and then killed him, basically.
3372 := I don't think he was as lucky as you think.
3373 := Why didn't he just deactivate you?
3374 := So he set you upon his own company?
3375 := Wait... tell me about this assassination protocol.
3376 := Why not?
3377 := You killed your own master?
3378 := Are you implying I am inept?
3379 := I happen to be very good at what I do.
3380 := So... you belonged to Revan originally?
3381 := You find it distressing?
3382 := So... why the 'meatbag' references?
3383 := So... Malak was the original meatbag? I like that idea.
3384 := What can you tell me of Malak?
3385 := Do you know anything about the Star Forge?
3386 := Am I very much like the Revan you knew?
3387 := I doubt you could have done anything.
3388 := Hmm... maybe a little.
3389 := Don't talk about Bastila like that!
3390 := It's probably better it worked out this way.
3391 := You don't need to call me master, you know.
3392 := But I'm *not* your master.
3393 := What difference does that make?
3394 := I see. I did purchase you, if you'll remember...
3395 := Can that programming be removed?
3396 := Who added that to your system?
3397 := If I'm your master, you should listen to my orders.
3398 := Whoa, slow down there. Yes, I did purchase you...
3399 := What legal requirements do you mean?
3400 := And I can't ask you to break the law?
3401 := So just who is the master here, then?
3402 := So... you're a blaster but I'm pulling the trigger?
3403 := I don't think 'killee' is a word.
3404 := Models of your type? What type is that?
3405 := There are legal requirements for illegal models?
3406 := But... how can an illegal model be regulated?
3407 := What's the difference?
3408 := Why all the fuss over you calling me master?
3409 := Maybe we'll just keep you a little illegal, then.
3410 := Stop saying meatbag, already!
3411 := That's an image I did not need.
3412 := Well I don't, so stop it.
3413 := As much as you would like to? What does that mean?
3414 := Demeaning, is it?
3415 := Just... stop talking.
3416 := You're not making it any better.
3417 := You're not my servant!
3418 := Why can't you comply with my command?
3419 := Why not?
3420 := Well, maybe I can fix that.
3421 := What sorts of safeguards?
3422 := Your systems have been tampered with?
3423 := Who did that?
3424 := Fine, forget it, then.
3425 := I can live with that.
3426 := Oh, goody.
3427 := You don't know?
3428 := Almost completely?
3429 := Why not?
3430 := Fine, forget it, then.
3431 := Well... let me know if you remember anything, then.
3432 := 'Organic meatbags?'
3433 := I would hope not!
3434 := Fine, fine. Whatever.
3435 := Just... stop calling me master.
3436 := No!
3437 := Are you deliberately trying to insult me?
3438 := How about 'human'?
3439 := You'll just have to suffer.
3440 := Would you prefer I call you 'junk'?
3441 := No it does not suffice!
3442 := No, I am *not*.
3443 := Do you want to end up in the trash heap?
3444 := I just don't appreciate being called a meatbag.
3445 := Fine. Just stop calling me master.
3446 := Why not? I don't need a lippy droid.
3447 := What, 'meatbag' isn't considered lippy these days?
3448 := Untrue? You've been lippy since I bought you.
3449 := I guess you're not all bad...
3450 := Now, listen here...
3451 := You're pretty bloodthirsty for a droid, aren't you?
3452 := You just called me a meatbag *again*!
3453 := Just stop talking. I give up!
3454 := What was that?
3455 := You're the one who's driving me mad!
3456 := Neither do I, come to think of it...
3457 := *sigh* Just stop calling me master, at least.
3458 := I survive. Somehow.
3459 := I would like to know more about your functionality.
3460 := Are you damaged?
3461 := Is there any way to repair you?
3462 := So I can restore your memory?
3463 := Okay, that will be all.
3464 := So how do I go about restoring part of your memory?
3465 := So you're saying that your memory might just... come back?
3466 := Tell me what you can, then.
3467 := Can you do anything else?
3468 := An assassin?
3469 := Err... I won't tell anyone.
3470 := I'm glad it's gone, really.
3471 := Has that function been... used a lot?
3472 := Is there any way to reactive that function?
3473 := How can you not know parts of your functionality?
3474 := I thought you said that removing your restraining bolt would restore your memory?
3475 := So you lied to me.
3476 := I want you to rejoin the party.
3477 := I want to switch you with another party member.
3478 := Ah, so we meet again, Canderous. It has been quite a long time.
3479 := Jagi??
3480 := I have business with Canderous that does not concern you, Jedi.
3481 := This concerns my employer as well.
3482 := Employer? You've sunk that low, have you? So much for the vaunted Mandalorian honor you used to espouse.
3483 := He... he was a warrior under my command up to the battle of Althir. But I thought...
3484 := You thought I was dead, didn't you! You thought all of us that you had sent on that attack had perished!
3485 := You sent us to die in a foolish attack while you directed your forces elsewhere!
3486 := You broke from the battle plan and let us die for it, so that you could have the 'honor' of being the first to the enemy commander!
3487 := I alone realized what was happening and managed to escape the trap before it closed. The trap he set for his own men!
3488 := That does not excuse what he did to us!
3489 := I... I did what was prudent at the time. If I had not done it, the battle would have....
3490 := The battle would have been won anyway! I am tired of your excuses, Canderous.
3491 := I have spent years tracking you down since the clans were banished, and I will not rest until I have had my vengeance!
3492 := I am not afraid of you. And if you choose, you can die by his side as well!
3493 := I challenge you Canderous. I challenge you to fight the fight you fled that day above Althir.
3494 := In the dune seas of Tatooine, I will be waiting for you. I have spread the news of the challenge since I learned you had landed on this world.
3495 := All the surviving Mandalorian clans know of what I do here, and that we shall meet on Tatooine to settle this debt of vengeance once and for all.
3496 := If you fail to meet me there, you shall be stripped of all honor and forever cast out of our society!
3497 := It will be you and me alone in the dune seas of Tatooine: a final battle that can only end in death.
3498 := I shall be waiting for you there, Canderous.
3499 := Ah so you managed to come after all. I see you brought friends.
3500 := You brought some of your own as well.
3501 := Ha! Indeed I did. I foresaw that you might need help so I arranged a distraction.
3502 := Big words from such a small human. But I know why he brought you here, and you shall regret his choice!
3503 := I do not need to hear your excuses, Jedi! I know why he brought you!
3504 := Enough of this talk, Jagi! Let us do what we came here to do.
3505 := Yes, but children who can... er... what?! You do not know what you're talking about, Jedi!
3506 := This is a matter of honor. I cannot stand by this insult. I must do this.
3507 := In the battle above the world of Althir, he ordered us to attack the enemy flank, promising us support.
3508 := But when he saw better prospects for his own glory, he abandoned us and left us to die surrounded by enemies!
3509 := If I had not attacked when I did, the battle would not have been won so easily!
3510 := It would still have been won! You sent your own men to die there Canderous. I cannot forgive you for what you did to us! You will pay!
3511 := That's not the way it happened...
3512 := The Althiri were fighting hard. I saw a break in their defenses that left their center exposed. I had to take the chance.
3513 := If I had not done what I did, many more warriors would have died and the battle would have taken much longer. I stand by my decision.
3514 := You coward! You glory hunter! You were given direct orders and were part of a plan! You had a responsibility to us!
3515 := I... I can regret their loss, but it was necessary.
3516 := [Failure] Don't try you mind tricks on me! A true Mandalore is too strong for that!
3517 := And now you shall die for the attempt!
3518 := [Success] Yes... I... do not want to fight...
3519 := No! Do not alter his mind to defend me! I can fight my own battles without your help!
3520 := You... Wha? You tried to manipulate my mind with your devious Jedi powers! I cannot tolerate any interference!
3521 := You shall die for that, Jedi!
3522 := I have had enough of your prattle, Jedi! This is between Canderous and I.
3523 := And we shall settle this now once and for all.
3524 := They do... I know that, but he did not have to abandon us! He should have stayed with the plan!
3525 := I saw my chance to end the battle quickly and I took it. I regret the men I lost, but it was necessary.
3526 := Then you know we must end this now.
3527 := We must.
3528 := At the cost of our lives? He may have saved others in the long run, but... but...
3529 := He cost us ours! But... but I do see you point...
3530 := But... Why did you have to leave us there to die while you chased glory somewhere else?
3531 := I saw a chance and had to take it. It ended the battle quicker than we would have otherwise, and many of our warriors may have died.
3532 := Mandalore taught us that opportunism and flexibility in battle were to be admired. You may contradict me, but do you contradict him as well?
3533 := No! I... I... I see that I have been wrong. I have not been true to the teachings of Mandalore.
3534 := You were right. I was wrong to question your honor. But I must now cleanse mine with my life.
3535 := And so it shall be.
3536 := He left us to die when his responsibility was to us! Instead he went hunting more glory for himsefl!
3537 := You shall all die!
3538 := He has slandered me and questioned my honor. Among the Mandalore, many have died for much lesser insults.
3539 := I speak truth! And honor is the question here! The deaths of my comrades, your warriors, is a debt in blood that can only be paid by you.
3540 := When you saw prospects for glory, you abandoned the plan and left us to die surrounded by enemies!
3541 := We both know the stakes here, and we both know what we must do. It is only in death that this can end.
3542 := And you shall all die!
3543 := Get out of our way!
3544 := Who is this guy?
3545 := Do you know him, Canderous?
3546 := You lived.
3547 := Tough decisions are made in war.
3548 := Is this true, Canderous?
3549 := If you face Canderous, you face me as well!
3550 := What are you going to do?
3551 := You talk too much and do little.
3552 := Canderous works for me.
3553 := I came by my own will.
3554 := Both of you are acting like children!
3555 := Let's kill him then.
3556 := Why do you need to fight Canderous, Jagi?
3557 := I've had enough, let's kill him.
3558 := Why did you abandon them?
3559 := You sent your own men to die, Canderous?
3560 := [Force Persuade] You do not want to fight, Jagi.
3561 := [Persuade] People die in war, Jagi.
3562 := He probably should have.
3563 := He was trying to end it quickly.
3564 := He may have saved other lives by doing what he did.
3565 := Good riddance!
3566 := You do not have to do this!
3567 := No!
3568 := [Persuade] Jagi, what he did was a smart tactical move.
3569 := Maybe he shouldn't have left you.
3570 := Then let's get rid of Jagi and his men.
3571 := Why do you need to fight him, Canderous?
3572 := I think you both need to calm down.
3573 := Let's do it, Canderous.
3574 := *Sigh* I have no idea what you're talking about. Rabble rabble... what are you saying.
3575 := Stop bothering me with your questions! I can barely hear myself think.
3576 := Got something on your mind, do you?
3577 := Oh, I get it. Let's play with the old man's head, is it? He's half-senile, he'll forget I said anything! Wait uh, what was this about, anyway?
3578 := Are we back to *that* again?
3579 := Hmmm... what's the best way for me to approach this? Ah, perhaps it's time for a little story...
3580 := You just keep quiet there, you! I've had to put up with all your busy-body questions, haven't I? Well, now you'll listen to a story, dammit!
3581 := *ahem* Now where was I? Oh yes, the story... you almost made me forget about it. Nice try, but I'm not that old just yet. Heh heh.
3582 := Now, then. A young man sees a terribly venemous snake in his small village. Nervous, he watches the snake carefully until it leaves.
3583 := The young man follows the snake into the forest. He clears the branches out of its path and helps it over obstacles. He even works to keep it fed.
3584 := Shush! Many nights pass and still the young man continues to follow the snake. He even follows it into the sands of the great desert.
3585 := In the desert, the snake eventually grows hungry. It turns and bites the young man, its poison quickly working its way into his system.
3586 := Finally curious, the snake looks at the boy as he lays dying and asks, "Why were you foolish enough to follow me all the way out into the desert?"
3587 := The boy looks back and replies, "Did I follow you? I thought I was leading you away from everyone else..." And then he died.
3588 := Well, now, that's what I wanted to see for myself.
3589 := I've told you before that you have a destiny before you. This does not mean, however, that your future is already written. They are not the same thing.
3590 := You have the choice of which direction you take your destiny in. More than engine-sucking Andor, certainly... but even he had a choice.
3591 := So far you've chosen to take the lighter path. Can you stay that course, even through the challenges ahead? We'll have to wait and see.
3592 := I'm not here to judge you or tell you which path to take. I'm here ready to offer you my help... should you ask for it.
3593 := I do that because I think it's important. More important than remaining in my home and pretending the galaxy doesn't exist. That's why I'm here.
3594 := That's very kind of you, but while elsewhere may be safer, elsewhere isn't where I think I should be. Besides... what's an old man to fear from death, eh?
3595 := Now, then... I've chatted enough for one lifetime. Let's get this show on the road, shall we?
3596 := Hmph. So you say, but it's my time to waste. Perhaps I can influence your decision, perhaps not... only time will tell, won't it?
3597 := Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lass. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.
3598 := Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lad. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.
3599 := So far you've chosen to take a darker path. You know the consequences of that... we'll see if you decide to stay your course.
3600 := The real question is whether or not I'm as frightened as I should be, isn't it?
3601 := Well, then... let's hope you're not the young man, either.
3602 := I've come a long way as it is, and I'm going to die anyway so that doesn't bother me in the least.
3603 := Oh, that was not until many years later, to tell the truth. I spent quite some time wandering the galaxy.
3604 := Nothing so extravagant. I merely traveled from place to place... I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.
3605 := It wasn't as if my travels were pleasant, either. There were plenty of folks who distrusted the Jedi after the war... or worse.
3606 := I was lost. I couldn't conceive of returning to the Jedi, so what would you propose I'd done?
3607 := I suppose so. Not everyone would understand why the Jedi would suddenly start killing themselves and tearing up half the galaxy, would they?
3608 := If people weren't treating me with suspicion, they were looking at me with greed. I don't know how many thought they could make use of me for their own ends.
3609 := I got so sick of the treachery and deceit I left the civilized parts of the galaxy and headed instead for the uncivilized parts.
3610 := Actually I was on my way somewhere else when I crash-landed on Kashyyyk. The ship I was using was a rust-bucket.
3611 := Sure, why not? It seemed like an interesting enough place to spend a couple of decades exploring.
3612 := They did at first, oh yes. I can't say I was overly pleased to encounter a group of indigenous giant carpets either, I can assure you of that.
3613 := And why would I have been interested in that? You can't spend five minutes in a Wookiee village without coming out smelling like wet fur.
3614 := No, no, let them rule themselves. They can screw up their history just like every other race before them. No, I helped them in other ways.
3615 := When I could. I would assist the few young ones who would get lost in the Shadowlands or attacked unexpectedly by the wildlife.
3616 := I must say... for a while there, the Wookiees actually thought I was some kind of benevolent forest god. Amusing, really. I set them straight eventually.
3617 := Not really. Kashyyyk is a place you can feel very small in. It felt good to devote my time to helping people and living simply.
3618 := What can I say? I did it all for the Wookiees.
3619 := The Wookiees. Well, okay, maybe I needed some time on a quiet and remote planet... but if you ever need a friend, an incredibly strong hairball isn't a bad call.
3620 := See? Now you know how I feel half the time.
3621 := At any rate, we should be moving along, don't you think? If you sat around this long in the Shadowlands, a tach would eat you.
3622 := I suppose I am, in a way, despite the smell. For a race of gardeners, they've developed quite interestingly.
3623 := You remember the alien computer, correct? Kashyyyk was meant to be an agricultural planet. The Wookiees were made for a reason.
3624 := Or, at least, that's what I'm thinking. But I'm an old man who's had a long time to develop that opinion, so don't argue with me.
3625 := Why, thank you. You're not so bad, yourself, all things considered.
3626 := Nonsense. I had no idea that's what they were thinking for a long time. I just thought they were being friendly neighbours, leaving fruit and such for me.
3627 := Later, when I started to understand some of their grunting, I realized they would say prayers to the 'hairless one' before descending into the forest.
3628 := Hmph. Hairless one. I used to have plenty of hair, I tell you. *Ahem* Well, at any rate, it took a few bruises, but I set the record straight.
3629 := I traveled to Rrookworro and met with the chieftain in front of everyone. Freyyr swatted at me just to see if I was real or not.
3630 := I was real, and while it was a light swat, Wookiees are terribly strong. I was knocked out cold for a day. The Wookiees all thought it was quite funny.
3631 := At first, when the slavers took to hunting down lone Wookiees in the fringes of the Shadowlands, I did my best to divert them.
3632 := Later, when Chuundar made his deal I didn't see any point. I wasn't here to save them from their own sad follies, after all.
3633 := Well that was after two decades of helping them. They certainly didn't trust me at first.
3634 := No, no. I was the intruder in their land, after all. They got to trust me well enough after a couple of decades of my aid.
3635 := Bah, what do you know? I'd done enough wandering by that point, thank you very much. I felt at peace in the Shadowlands.
3636 := Hmmm. That was a challenge at first. You've seen the kind of creatures that exist down there... and you missed the really big ones.
3637 := I was still able to rely on the Force to keep me safe for the most part. The rest of the trick is keeping out of the way of most of the predators.
3638 := No, that's true. Still... most of the creatures grew accustomed to me, and I to them. At least none of them ever heard of a Jedi.
3639 := Hmph. I'm no mechanic. And besides, after you plunge nose-first into the trunk of a five-kilometer high tree, chances are you don't have much ship left.
3640 := I'd taken some damage passing through an unexpected asteroid field, as I recall, but I wasn't completely without some systems. I could still guide her a bit when I crashed.
3641 := It wasn't what a would call the smoothest landing, especially considering I ended up smack in the depths of the Shadowlands. But I lived.
3642 := Why wouldn't they? I had refused my promotion to Jedi... I was a Padawan who had left the Order, nothing more.
3643 := I traveled from one civilized system to the next, never staying long. I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.
3644 := Not particularly.
3645 := Hmm. Such a charming and persuasive manner you have there. Forget it!
3646 := [Failure] *Sigh* I'm not interested in your demands. I'll tell my story when I'm damn good and ready... which isn't now, so shoo!
3647 := [Success] I suppose you're going to nag me until I cough it up, aren't you? Nothing is private anymore, it looks like.
3648 := *sigh* There's no escaping it, I guess. So be it.
3649 := My wife's name was Nayama. She was the Ukatis enforcer who shot me out of the sky, if you remember.
3650 := No I'm not senile, dammit! Not yet, anyway. Hmmm... well at least I don't think so. At any rate, I'll tell the story the way I want to.
3651 := Bah. You got ears that work, don't you? I was a smuggler, way way back. I got shot down once over Ukatis. THAT story, yes.
3652 := My wife had plenty to do with the war. Upon meeting her, I knew right away that she was strong in the Force. That's why she was able to shoot me down.
3653 := Nayama was a marvel of a woman. Fiery, determined, smart... she dragged me to the capital and foiled three of my attempts to escape prison. Oh, and that body...
3654 := Well... yes, that. Needless to say I eventually won her over. That was after I kidnapped her upon being broken out of the Ukatis prison, mind you. But uh, that's another story entirely.
3655 := At any rate, I wanted to train her in the Jedi way. The Council refused my request, naturally. I was still a Padawan at the time.
3656 := Nayama was intrigued by the idea of becoming a Jedi. She liked the idea of power too much, perhaps, but I certainly didn't see that at the time.
3657 := I believed in her and trained her in secret. I ignored her willful nature... I loved her too much to see fault in her.
3658 := And she loved me, too. I know she did. At the time, our love was a shared bliss... better than anything I had known before or since.
3659 := Exar Kun is what happened. Nayama was inspired by Exar's promises of a new Golden Age. She wanted to join him.
3660 := She came to me, pleading with me to throw aside what she called the decrepit trappings of the Jedi... to join her in Exar's war.
3661 := I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about all that she was throwing away... to think about what she would become.
3662 := She would have none of it. Finally, in frustration, she attacked me. She drew her lightsaber and attempted to strike me down.
3663 := It was a scene being repeated everywhere throughout the galaxy. Pupil against master. In my case... it was a long and terrible battle, but I defeated her.
3664 := No... no. I had her at my mercy, disarmed and defenseless. She looked up at me and she knew... she knew I couldn't do it.
3665 := Was I? Sometimes I convince myself that I couldn't have done otherwise... that I couldn't have seen that she had truly fallen to the dark side. But, yes, I was a fool.
3666 := And I let her go. To my shame, she went on to kill many Jedi during the war until she, herself, was slain in the final battle.
3667 := I grieved for her death, inevitable as it was, even as the Jedi Council put me on trial for my actions once the war was over.
3668 := I had trained Nayama against their wishes. I had failed to kill her when I had the chance, and she went on to kill others.
3669 := It was a travesty, of course. I told you that even the Jedi were capable of great injustices, didn't I?
3670 := But I deserved to be tried. They found me innocent.
3671 := Even though I... deserved every punishment and more... they let me go. Mitigating circumstances, they said. I deserved compassion, they said.
3672 := That... that was when the Jedi left me. That was when they failed me.
3673 := They may have been able to forgive me. I... could never forgive myself.
3674 := I...
3675 := Yes, I do, I suppose. Does that surprise you?
3676 := Ahhh... it is all so long ago. Lost in the winds, I suppose. Nobody cares what an old man believes anymore, do they?
3677 := Let's continue on with the task at hand. I would prefer to think of the present today.
3678 := For my pride? For my cowardice? Which do you think is the act more befitting a Jedi?
3679 := No. Maybe you don't, at that.
3680 := Of course I deserved to be punished. They found me innocent.
3681 := Not at all. They found me innocent.
3682 := Yes. I think she truly fell the moment she raised up her saber against me. I have played that instant in my head... so many times.
3683 := But I should have. Sometimes I convince myself otherwise... but it's no use. She had fallen to the dark side when she raised her saber against me.
3684 := No of course I didn't kill her. How could I? I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about what she was doing.
3685 := I... hadn't thought so. Not right then. I was too proud to believe that of her. I had trained her myself... I loved her.
3686 := Easy to say so now. At the time I just thought I was right.
3687 := I did. I wasn't the first and I won't be the last. The problem with self-righteous folk is they think they're more right than everyone else.
3688 := Bad, bad men. Women, too, to be fair.
3689 := Who's playing games? Ask the next Sith you see if they're bad and they'll set you straight.
3690 := *sigh* And just what gave you the impression that I know anything more about the Sith than you do?
3691 := Oh... that's right. Damn the ears of the young! I was expecting you to be your usual inattentive self when I mentioned that.
3692 := So it's true, yes, I fought plenty of Sith. That was during the time of Exar Kun... oh, fourty years ago now? Has it been that long?
3693 := A Sith believes he commands the Force... but it is the dark side who commands him. You know this, there is little else I could truly add.
3694 := Ah. Exar was a Jedi who was... corrupted... by ghosts of the old Sith. Or so they say. He attempted to conquer the Republic and create a new Golden Age of the Sith.
3695 := Better to say he was defeated... but essentially, yes. The victory did not come easily, however.
3696 := No, no, of course not. The Sith have come and gone for ages. They were not called Sith many thousands of years ago, perhaps, but the dark side was always present without a doubt.
3697 := Oh, sure, occasionally the light side comes close to vanquishing the dark, but the dark always returns.
3698 := The fact that Exar Kun was defeated didn't mean the Sith would never return, as they obviously have now. Everyone knows that.
3699 := That... is not a pleasant time to remember. After Exar Kun fell to the dark side, he attempted to recruit other Jedi to his cause.
3700 := What surprised us... what took us completely unprepared... was how utterly successful he was. Many Jedi joined him and became Sith, themselves.
3701 := Why they did I... I will never truly know. But they did. Battle broke out throughout the order... pupil against master, we fought ourselves...
3702 := I've often held the opinion that history has one basic flaw: it is seldom heeded.
3703 := So go on and greet the world with your spite. Let's see where it takes you. You certainly don't need to hear any more from me.
3704 := Easy now to call them traitors. Tell me... how do you fight against someone that you love?
3705 := Bah. I dislike such memories. It leaves a taste in the mouth that... it is a sadness I thought I had put aside long ago.
3706 := Ask me again about the war some other time. Just... not now. I would prefer to be by myself for now.
3707 := Yes. More than difficult... next to impossible. How do you fight against someone you love?
3708 := Oh, indeed. They make a fine sandwich, also. Heh heh heh. But don't tell the Jedi Council I said that.
3709 := Heh heh. Who said I left the Jedi?
3710 := Don't get so uppity, dammit! The point I was trying to make, if you decide to actually listen, is that I never left the order. The order left *me*.
3711 := Well, technically, I was only a Padawan... not that that makes a difference to most. But as for the order, itself... no, I never left it. It left *me*.
3712 := Something wrong with your ears? I thought folks only went deaf when they got to my age. I follow the Jedi Way and use the Force, don't I? That makes me a Jedi last time I checked.
3713 := But the order, itself, the Jedi Council and so forth... no, I'm not a part of that and haven't been for a long time. And good riddance, I say!
3714 := Hmph. A rogue, am I? You speak as if there must be something wrong with me, like not being part of the order makes me a criminal.
3715 := Oh, is it? Hmph. There are moments when I think you must be much older than you seem... but this isn't one of them.
3716 := You know what I hate? Well... you know, lots of things, really. But I'm old and easily annoyed. But that's beside the point. What I *really* hate are how most people view the Jedi.
3717 := Everyone thinks that Jedi are perfect, that they can do no wrong. They think the Jedi Council is completely incapable of injustice.
3718 := Quiet, you. I'm not talking about me. Talking about the Jedi as a whole. They are just as capable of imperfection and injustice as anyone else, as you can obviously see.
3719 := And I'm not even talking about how some of us fall to the dark side. No, that's plenty indication of our fallibility, but it's something else entirely.
3720 := No, I'm talking about how, more often than not, your average robe-wearing Jedi can try to do the right thing and still be completely *wrong*.
3721 := That's true, but it's not what I meant. I guess I'm not being clear, am I?
3722 := No, no. The Jedi always treated me well. It would be foolish and untrue to say otherwise. That's not what I meant, anyway.
3723 := *sigh* I suppose I'm not being very clear, am I?
3724 := Come to think of it, I don't have to be clear. Someone my age is entitled to ramble, dammit! But for your sake I'll try to explain.
3725 := I'll tell you a little tale about a Jedi Master I once knew. Hortath, I think. Or was it Hartoth? I could never get it straight...
3726 := You're the one who was asking me about the Jedi, dammit! Now do you want the story or not?
3727 := Boring you, am I? Well you just keep your questions to yourself next time. No need for old men to go and make nuisances of themselves.
3728 := *Sigh* You know the problem with the youth of today? They're young.
3729 := Where was I, then? Oh. Oh, yes... Master Hortath. He was a kindly old Jedi who meant well, but the most near-sighted thing in the Core, I swear.
3730 := He would walk into walls, knock over tables, mistake apprentices for rancor beasts... that sort of thing. And he was too proud to submit to proper treatment.
3731 := Some used to counsel him and urged "Use the Force, Master Hortath. Allow the Force to see for you." But he refused to believe that his eyes were failing.
3732 := He simply squinted more and more as the years went on, the other Jedi resignedly passing it off as the amusing quirk of a compassionate old man.
3733 := So one day a young Padawan meets Master Hortath in the courtyard and, not knowing of his blindness, asks him for directions to the Council.
3734 := Quite sure of himself, Hortath gave the lad directions... which happened to lead back outside and away from the enclave.
3735 := The Padawan is confused, naturally. He asks if Master Hortath is sure, and of course Master Hortath says that he is.
3736 := The Padawan suggests that perhaps he should ask someone else... but the proud Hortath now feels insulted. He tells the Padawan to take the route he prescribed and no other.
3737 := Rather dejectedly, the Padawan did as he was told... and so ended up leaving the Jedi Order forever.
3738 := It was decided that the boy's fate was to leave the Order anyway... though whether that was out of respect for Hortath or because the boy went on to something else, well, we'll never know.
3739 := So I did. Master Hortath was a proud man.
3740 := Considering that it's about blindness, I think that's an appropriate response. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?
3741 := The tale is about blindness and I thought the point was clear. At any rate, you think about it. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?
3742 := Now let's get going. My feet are itching for a good run.
3743 := No, no. Both of them were from before my time. Well before the Sith Wars, even.
3744 := Not much. I never knew the Padawan nor met Master Hortath, himself. He was before my time.
3745 := I'm not finished yet! Now shush.
3746 := Damn right I disagree. The Jedi are just as capable of injustice as anyone else. They may *try* harder, sure, but sometimes they get it wrong.
3747 := Hmph. I guess you aren't as stupid as you sometimes act. No doubt you've been on the receiving end of Jedi justice at least once, eh?
3748 := I don't want to talk about that.
3749 := Yes you do. You may mean well enough, but my private affairs are just that: private.
3750 := Let me tell you something. Once you've lived as many years as I have, you'll have yourself a long, long list of memories.
3751 := If you're lucky, most of them will be good. If you're not, some will be bad. If you're really unlucky, some will be so bad you never want to be reminded of them again... ever.
3752 := You'll go far away, to a place that doesn't hold any memories at all. And there you'll be happy just to forget and be forgotten.
3753 := There are worse things to call yourself, for better reasons. If you don't think it's even possible that you might be flinging those words at yourself one day, you're younger than I thought.
3754 := Let me ask you this: have you ever been in love? Truly in love, I mean, and not simple infatuation.
3755 := Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be men in your life... perhaps many men... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.
3756 := The Jedi, with their damnable sense of over-caution, would tell you love is something to avoid. Thankfully, anyone who's even partially alive knows that's not true.
3757 := And why not? All this nonsense about avoiding love is so much foo-foo. I shouldn't be the only one who realizes that.
3758 := Love doesn't lead to the dark side. Passion can lead to rage and fear, and can be controlled... but passion is not the same thing as love.
3759 := Controlling your passions while being in love... that's what they should teach you to beware. But love, itself, will save you... not condemn you.
3760 := Ahhhh, but listen to me go on as if I had all the answers. What do I know of love anymore? I'm just a lonely old man who's not even a Jedi.
3761 := You do, do you? I wouldn't listen too closely... I'm no authority on anything. I just think that the greatest things in life shouldn't be avoided because they come with a few complications.
3762 := Don't I? Hmph. Maybe you're right. It seems whatever I have to say is falling on deaf ears, anyhow.
3763 := So go on, go on, run amok and kiss the bantha for all I care. I won't comment on it.
3764 := Hmph. Maybe. Do you want to avoid the greatest things in life simply because they come with some complications?
3765 := Love causes pain, certainly. Inevitably love is going to lead to as much sorrow and regret as it does joy. I suppose there are perfect, eternal loves out there... but I haven't seen any.
3766 := How you deal with the bad part of love is what determines your character, what determines the dark side's hold over you.
3767 := I haven't changed my mind. I'm still not going to talk about it. You go and find your own love if you want to know so badly.
3768 := I'll tell you one thing: sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you and the one you love simply aren't meant to be together.
3769 := The trick is to know when that is, to know when it's time to fight and when it's time to part ways.
3770 := Hmph... there I go waxing philosophical again. Somebody blast me already! Let's get going before I start talking in riddles, dammit!
3771 := Bah. A life without risk is boring. Is that how you want to live? You want love, you've got to fight for it.
3772 := I suppose it could. It would take a strong person to make that kind of commitment, I think. Someone with a great sense of self.
3773 := Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be women in your life... perhaps many women... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.
3774 := Heh. Partly, maybe. I doubt I could ever explain it to you fully, even if I wanted to.
3775 := You say that now, but I'm talking to you from across the breadth of many years experience. That is a gap I simply can't cross for you.
3776 := Now that's a unique method of getting someone to talk. Thunder about like a bantha in a circuit shop. Does that work for you often?
3777 := Maybe, but I doubt it. I'm made stubborn that way.
3778 := Did I say that? Strange the tricks memory plays on you when you get older.
3779 := Didn't I say that my past was my affair? You don't see me poking and prodding you with questions, do you?
3780 := Hmph. I might be. But a mouthy young thing like yourself shouldn't get to call me an old coot, dammit.
3781 := And besides... you don't really want to hear about me. We're talking ancient history, probably before you were born. History bores kids. Proven fact.
3782 := So you're not. Fine, have it your way. Just don't say I didn't warn you.
3783 := Yes, yes, I was an adventurer. Happy now? I wasn't even done with my Jedi training back then. I had a full head of hair and an eagerness to see absolutely everything.
3784 := Sound familiar? The Council was never very happy with willful, brash Jolee Bindo, you see. Even less so when I began my smuggling career.
3785 := At the time the Ukatis system was interdicted by its own King. He preferred to keep his people starving and poor, all the better to oppress them.
3786 := The Senate was trying to negotiate a peace, but they were getting nowhere as usual. I decided I wasn't going to wait.
3787 := I found myself a ship and a partner and we began smuggling food and supplies to the Ukatis citizenry through the blockade.
3788 := Why not? There were millions of people crying out for aid. What else was I supposed to do?
3789 := Don't be stupid. Are you doing nothing? If nothing's not good enough for you there's no reason it should have been good enough for me back then, either.
3790 := Well... we didn't *buy* all the equipment, per se. Some were happy to donate goods. Some we just, ah, knew had more than they could use...
3791 := 'Stole' is such a harsh word. They would have donated those goods readily enough if they were compassionate. I considered it a tax on the greedy.
3792 := We only got caught once. A lone Ukatish frigate shot us down and forced a crash landing. I thought the Force had abandoned me, as I remember.
3793 := Hmph. As I recall, I'm not the only person in this conversation who's been shot down out of the sky recently.
3794 := Oh, so you're going to speak for the Force now, are you? I deserved to crash, is that it?
3795 := Well, as it happens, getting shot down turned out to be very fortunate. That day was the day I...
3796 := Well, that... that was the day I met my wife.
3797 := No. No, that was a good memory. There are just... much worse ones that followed.
3798 := I... If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to stop talking now. My mouth is starting to draw flies.
3799 := You know another way to get a wife? But, yes... that's when I met her.
3800 := It's alright. When you're digging through the trash, you shouldn't be surprised when you encounter something unpleasant.
3801 := Oh, it was. I was a half-decent pilot in those days... and with the Force guiding me, we made it through some tough spots nobody else would have.
3802 := Pilot, smuggler... several other things, too. Or did you suppose I was always a crotchety hermit?
3803 := You're very sure of that, are you? My, my, you must be very learned and experienced to know so many things. At any rate, I was still a Padawan at the time.
3804 := Don't look at me like that, dammit! I wasn't always the wrinkled coot I am now, you know. I can still fight, too, so wipe off that smirk I see there.
3805 := Oh fine, fine, have it your way. Just don't cry about it later.
3806 := I'm not here to satisfy your curiosity! No staring at the old man, that's what the sign says, dammit!
3807 := Well that's a relief. Maybe an old man can finally get some peace around here. Now, run along and do whatever you were doing, already.
3808 := No, I never did, did I?
3809 := My, my, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the starship this morning, I see. Is that a chip on your shoulder or are you a bit surly today?
3810 := Elusive? Me, elusive? Heh. Obviously you've never tried to grab a Twi'lek dancing girl after drinking too much Ondaran willek juice.
3811 := Of course you do. I know things, remember? You think you could make it around this part of the galaxy without me? Don't answer that.
3812 := At any rate, I already told you why I wanted to leave. I'd seen everything I wanted to on Kashyyyk. Time to go, time to move on.
3813 := You live in an overgrown stump with the tachs beating down your door and you tell me how happy you would be. I was pleased just to have visitors.
3814 := The hermit says he's tired of living alone in the giant forest and you find that hard to believe? How cynical are you?
3815 := To bed. I'm old and tired, you know.
3816 := How many kilometer-high trees can you find an interest in before you figure you've had enough? I'd bet you can't be bothered to stay in one room for more than fifteen minutes.
3817 := And then there's all the critters in the Shadowlands... I'm just happy to be back in space, doing something new. Is that too much to ask?
3818 := There, now, was that so hard? An old man has to be allowed some petty eccenticities. Nice to see you agree, for once.
3819 := You got a smart mouth on you there, you know that? If ullers could talk, they'd sound like that.
3820 := So I could. Not having a ship does tend to put a damper on that kind of idea, however.
3821 := I'll admit... for all its flaws, Kashyyyk was home enough. But when you came along and I saw the destiny you had before you, I couldn't help but be intrigued.
3822 := Have I offered a single opinion? No, I haven't, though you could do far worse than hear a couple of mine. Your destiny, after all, is rather unclear.
3823 := Interest? Well, I certainly don't have a vested interest... call it more idle curiosity. Your destiny is... rather unclear.
3824 := Of course not. Weren't you listening last time? I can see that you have a destiny before you... but the details are far from clear.
3825 := In fact, everything about you that I can see is odd. Slightly off, as if my eyes are trying to trick me. Something... something is very dark about you...
3826 := ... but bah! I'm sure you don't need to hear my ruminations. You've probably got enough nosy Jedi offering you one opinion after another to make you sick.
3827 := I'll remind you that *you're* the one who started pumping me for information. Like an old man doesn't have anything better to do. Hmph.
3828 := Well I for one am quite content to let you make your own mistakes. Just because I want to see where this ends up doesn't mean I need to tell you how to get there.
3829 := Your future will come of its own accord, trust me. Sometimes navel-gazing at it doesn't get you anywhere.
3830 := I wouldn't worry about it too much, if I were you. You remind me a bit of Nomi, heh heh, and that can't be all bad.
3831 := Nomi Sunrider. She came late to the Force, just as you have, and became one of the greatest Jedi ever. Oh, fine, fine lass.
3832 := Whether you'll follow the same path remains to be seen. For one thing, we'll never get anywhere if you stand around chatting up old men all day...
3833 := Good, since I didn't offer to be one. You think anyone would want to mentor you with that kind of attitude? Not me, I'm past that.
3834 := One thing I will say is that this little escapade does remind me a bit of my adventuring days before the war. Ahh, those were exciting times.
3835 := Or at least it would remind me of those times if we didn't stand around. What's keeping you? You're too young to be so talkative. Shoo! Shoo!
3836 := Nonsense. Have I ever refused to help you when you asked? How confused can one person be, anyway?
3837 := Oh, stop being such a baby. Are you always so quick to turn aside an ally? Got too many of them, do you?
3838 := You got yourself a fast little ship. Heh. I'd forgotten what engines sounded like. The closest thing to that on Kashyyyk is an uller in mating season. Ugh! Frightful.
3839 := Or it could be for the free food. What's the gunk that comes out of the synthesizer on this bucket, anyway? Do you never clean the darned thing?
3840 := Wow, you're not much for interrogation, are you? Is this as hard as you try? Remind me to sign up for your next torture session.
3841 := How impatient can one person be? You must have driven your mother mad. All that gurgling and fussing... heh, babies are cute, but annoying.
3842 := I'm old, damn it! I'm allowed to be enigmatic when I want to be, and don't you go telling me otherwise.
3843 := You know, you remind me of someone else I knew ages ago. Pleasant enough fellow, great destiny... all of that. Breath like a bantha.
3844 := So I am. Tell you what... when you get to be my age, you can go ahead and answer any question you like, too. You have my permission.
3845 := No, but it could be. An Anduvian salt tablet would clear that right up, you know.
3846 := Oh ho ho, very funny. Is it my fault that some people are so easily annoyed? They're like impatient little children. With blasters.
3847 := Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes. Andor Vex, was his name. The Force swirled around him like a hurricane, that's how great his destiny was.
3848 := I did. Just because someone has the Force swirling about them doesn't always mean they have a great destiny, but it doesn't hurt to check it out.
3849 := Well, it's not so much a hurricane as a slight breeze. But that doesn't mean anything: destiny is sometimes in the eye of the beholder.
3850 := No, you wouldn't have. Sometimes swirling Force is just swirling Force. It gets us old Jedis excited at our age so we go "ooo, destiny!"
3851 := Well, it turned out that poor Andor believed a wee bit too much in the infallibility of that destiny. That overconfidence turned out to be his downfall.
3852 := I am not! I've no need to make things up, with my poor memory and all. You just sit still and let me finish, damn it.
3853 := Does it have to have a point? I thought we were just talking about Andor. Is something wrong with your attention span?
3854 := I don't know. Are you overconfident? I hadn't noticed. Even if I had, I would never comment on it. We're talking about Andor, remember?
3855 := Let's see... oh, yes. Andor's downfall. I was pretty young, myself, when it happened. At the time, I thought that Andor's destiny couldn't be more boring.
3856 := Well, he had a much better food dispenser than you do. That and the fact that even then I wasn't an altogether impatient *twit*.
3857 := You know, if you keep interrupting, it will take even longer. Have you no patience at all? How did you get as old as you are anyway?
3858 := Well, let's just say that I was a strapping young lad with a full head of hair and Coruscant was a small town with a well, heh heh.
3859 := I was just about to abandon Andor to whatever the Force intended for him when his ship was overtaken by a Dimean warship.
3860 := Now, you've probably never heard of the Dimeans, but at the time they were a nasty lot led by a nastier overlord named Kraat. Tall fellow. Big teeth.
3861 := Kraat has us hauled onto the bridge of his ship for questioning, and that's when I knew that Andor's destiny was at hand.
3862 := Well, Andor decides that his destiny makes him invulnerable and starts making all sorts of demands. Free me now, I'm not answering questions, blah blah blah. Don't you know who I am?
3863 := Kraat decides he's had enough and begins crushing Andor's neck. I told the boy he should have kept his mouth shut. I think he agreed, too... or those could have just been gurgling noises. Well... well, anyway.
3864 := Finally, Kraat has enough of Andor and tosses him aside into this giant energy intake shaft. Andor gets sucked in and starts bouncing around, heh, screaming... heh.
3865 := Maybe Andor hit something sensitive on the way down or just didn't agree with the reactor core, next thing I know all the ship's alarms are ringing.
3866 := Everyone panics and I run, barely making it to the ship in time before the explosion. Kraat dies horribly, and the Dimeans never quite recovered.
3867 := Changed the political course of the entire sector for centuries to come. I'd call that quite a destiny, wouldn't you?
3868 := Well, hey, the chances may not be great, but when one has the opportunity to see something like that twice in a lifetime...
3869 := Anyway, go on. My throat is dry and you're making me cranky. Shoo!
3870 := What?! Are you kidding?! What are the odds of that happening, anyway? A billion to one?
3871 := You should do so well as to be sucked into the engine of some evil Sith Lord, you know. Andor was a hero... sort of.
3872 := Well, now, that's the ingratitude of youth for you. I relate an exciting tale and do I get thanked for it? No, no, it's all 'me me me!' Hmph.
3873 := Swirling Force, remember? Jedi here? Granted, I was just interpreting the signs, but we get trained in that sort of thing. More or less.
3874 := Of course he did! Haven't you been listening? It was not in the way you'd probably expect, though.
3875 := Innocent, mm? I don't know what to make of it, to tell the truth. Do you think justice has been done?
3876 := But that has little to do with the law, does it? A sad state of affairs, that. Too bad, really... Sunry was a good man, once.
3877 := I see. I am not so sure. If he did kill that woman, Sunry's going to have to live with that on his conscience.
3878 := And if he's justified her death in his mind... well... Sunry was a good man, once. I only hope that is still the case. I enjoyed his company.
3879 := You defended him well enough. I wish we had had time to look into matters more fully, but wishing is only useful for the young and idealistic.
3880 := What's done is done. The Republic will likely appeal the matter eventually and he'll be free. I just... I just would like to know if that's best.
3881 := Sunry was a good man once. And a good friend. I'll miss him.
3882 := You did what was necessary. Sunry was guilty, as sad as that fact makes me, justice had to be done.
3883 := Doesn't matter that his victim was a Sith or that he was once a hero. I only wish that my old friend hadn't done it.
3884 := But that's the thing about wishes. They don't come true. And now Sunry's dead, which is a shame. He *was* a good man, you know... once.
3885 := Bah. I don't want to talk about this anymore. My jaw aches.
3886 := So you do. I once had a holodisc that showed Mandalore doing the three-step jiggy with a rancor beast. Marvelous technology we have.
3887 := It may have been. I believe you should, at least, keep that possibility in mind.
3888 := If somebody was going to go through all the trouble of making a false tape to indict Sunry you think it would have 'turned up' before now.
3889 := Maybe it would be a good idea to show the tape to Sunry. Perhaps he has an explanation. Or perhaps he doesn't.
3890 := It would be sad if this proved that Sunry did actually perform this crime, but... the truth is the truth. Whether I like it or not.
3891 := What? You think because I'm a hermit I've always been a hermit? Just because I haven't seen Sunry for twenty years doesn't mean he's not a friend.
3892 := A man could have changed a lot in that span of time, though. But to become a murderer? Oh, mm mm mm. I can't see it. That's not the Sunry I knew.
3893 := He was a good man. Put me up in his home for a year back after I left the order. War hero, too, or so I hear.
3894 := I wouldn't mind helping the fellow, if we can. I owe it to him. Or you can be a young monkey-lizard and ignore me, I guess... well, I don't expect much these days.
3895 := Hmph. I suppose I could whip up something, uh... you know... few herbs and such. You do know that the best alternative is not to get hurt, right?
3896 := Not to say that you go leaping into the path of blaster fire or anything, but I know how you young people get. Here, take it.
3897 := How many could you possibly need? And besides, I don't have enough supplies on me to put some more together.
3898 := Ask me later when you're actually in need and I'm less tired. I'm not a kit factory, you know.
3899 := No more than you. Get going.
3900 := It's a ship. To be more specific, it's *your* ship. You tell me.
3901 := Hmph. Hard to say what this planet is. Been lost for thousands of years, if not more. *Sniff* Smells like bad, bad karma so watch your step.
3902 := Manaan's an unusual place. Not for its water, mind you... it's the kolto. Healing juice. Only place where it occurs in the galaxy.
3903 := Pfah. Korriban's a rock. Mind the Sith.
3904 := Well, unless you're one of the local species and end up being slaughtered or enslaved, Tatooine's a nice enough desert.
3905 := Oh, I know plenty about Kashyyyk. You think someone doesn't live here for twenty years and pick up a thing or two?
3906 := Chances are that by the time I finished telling you about it all, you would have found out for yourself. So there's no reason for me to start blathering on.
3907 := It should be enough for me to tell you that there's kilometer after kilometer of trees on this planet. The deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets.
3908 := If you're smart, you stay on top with the Wookiees. Go deep, however, and you may find some things you weren't expecting.
3909 := And that's about all I got to say about that. Now let's get going.
3910 := Heh heh. Need my help, hey?
3911 := Good. I could use a rest.
3912 := There'll be time for chatter after we find whatever has caused this disturbance in the Force. It's dangerous, so keep on your toes.
3913 := Never mind.
3914 := So if you liked Kashyyyk so much, why did you want to leave?
3915 := Am I really all that interesting to you?
3916 := Forget I asked anything. I refuse to listen!
3917 := This is a very long story.
3918 := Am I supposed to be the snake?
3919 := And what's your judgment so far?
3920 := I'd prefer you were safe... elsewhere.
3921 := But I don't need you, really. You're wasting your time.
3922 := Thank you, Jolee. I'm glad you came.
3923 := Are you saying you're frightened of me?
3924 := I'm not a snake, I can assure you of that.
3925 := That's a long way to come just to risk dying.
3926 := Couldn't you just answer the question for once?
3927 := Oh, no, not another story!
3928 := I want a reason why I shouldn't just drop you off somewhere.
3929 := I find it hard to believe you left the Wookiees just for some adventure.
3930 := So when did you go to Kashyyyk?
3931 := Let me guess. Traveling from planet to planet, doing good deeds...
3932 := You were adventuring again, I take it?
3933 := I don't see why you were wandering in the first place.
3934 := With good reason, I imagine.
3935 := Worse? What could be worse?
3936 := So that's when you went to Kashyyyk?
3937 := So you crashed... and stayed?
3938 := And the Wookiees didn't mind your presence?
3939 := You could have ruled them, you know.
3940 := You helped them?
3941 := Wasn't it all a bit primitive for you?
3942 := I still think you're insane.
3943 := You spent two decades living like that?
3944 := And you didn't receive any news from the outside?
3945 := The Wookiees?
3946 := I regret asking you about this, now.
3947 := You sound quite fond of them.
3948 := Gardeners?
3949 := You are a very strange old man.
3950 := It sounds like you enjoyed being a god.
3951 := A few bruises?
3952 := Why didn't you stop the slavery of the Wookiees, then?
3953 := You seemed on fairly peaceful terms with them.
3954 := Did you fight them?
3955 := You're completely insane, you know that?
3956 := How did you survive in the Shadowlands?
3957 := It couldn't have been easy.
3958 := Why didn't you just fix your ship and keep going?
3959 := You survived a crash-landing on Kashyyyk?
3960 := The Jedi just let you go?
3961 := Do you want to talk about the war now?
3962 := You said you'd tell me later... so spit it out already.
3963 := [Persuade] Okay, here I am asking nicely.
3964 := Fine. Have it your way.
3965 := [Persuade] No time like the present?
3966 := Are you going senile? I didn't ask about your wife, old man.
3967 := Um... no, I don't remember.
3968 := What does your wife have to do with the war?
3969 := The war...?
3970 := And what did she think of all this?
3971 := So what happened?
3972 := What did you do?
3973 := You killed her?
3974 := You were a fool.
3975 := They put you on trial?
3976 := I can't believe they tried you for that!
3977 := You should have been happy you got off.
3978 := And you still believe love is worth the risk?
3979 := No, you're wrong! You did deserve compassion!
3980 := I don't understand...
3981 := So you think you didn't deserve to be punished?
3982 := So that's the source of all this bitterness? They found you guilty?
3983 := But... she was a Sith then, right?
3984 := I don't think I could have, either.
3985 := So you killed her, of course.
3986 := So she had fallen to the dark side?
3987 := So you're saying you were an idiot.
3988 := You disobeyed the Jedi Council?
3989 := I'll ask you some other time, then.
3990 := What do you know about the Sith?
3991 := I'm not in the mood to play games.
3992 := Spit it out, old man, or things get rough.
3993 := You're being elusive on purpose.
3994 := Do you know anything important about the Sith or not?
3995 := You did. You said you fought them.
3996 := So tell me what you know about the Sith.
3997 := Who is this Exar Kun?
3998 := And he was killed?
3999 := Are these the same Sith that we're fighting now?
4000 := What happened during the war with Exar Kun, then?
4001 := This isn't going to be more sad moaning, is it?
4002 := But you exterminated all the traitors, right?
4003 := That must have been difficult.
4004 := You must know more than that.
4005 := Why did you leave the Jedi?
4006 := Don't play games with me, old man.
4007 := Are you saying you're still a Jedi?
4008 := So are you a Jedi or not?
4009 := So you're just some rogue Jedi. Big deal.
4010 := Why good riddance?
4011 := But you said the Jedi left you?
4012 := That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard.
4013 := What do you mean 'it left you'?
4014 := You? Perfect? That's a laugh.
4015 := Nobody can be right about everything.
4016 := So the Jedi wronged you in some way, I take it?
4017 := I don't get it. What do you mean?
4018 := No, I don't have time for any stupid stories.
4019 := Not. Can't be bothered.
4020 := Fine, fine, but make it quick.
4021 := Is this going to have a point?
4022 := Go on, I'll listen.
4023 := Go on.
4024 := But... you said that Master Hortath was nearly blind, not deaf.
4025 := That's a stupid story.
4026 := So what's the point?
4027 := So... you knew this Master Hortath? Or the Padawan?
4028 := So what does the Padawan leaving the Jedi have to do with the Jedi leaving you?
4029 := I don't understand...
4030 := Is this supposed to have a point?
4031 := And? I don't get it.
4032 := Let me guess: you disagree?
4033 := I certainly don't think that.
4034 := You did. You said you weren't a Jedi any longer.
4035 := You mentioned something about your wife before?
4036 := I don't mean to pry, but...
4037 := Run away? How pathetic and weak.
4038 := Well...
4039 := What's this? Love advice from an old Jedi?
4040 := That's what I've always thought.
4041 := Aren't you worried about the dark side at all?
4042 := No, I want to hear what you have to say.
4043 := You talk too much, old man. You don't know anything.
4044 := Sounds like love is something you should have avoided.
4045 := So what happened between you and your wife, then?
4046 := Maybe the Jedi just think you shouldn't take that risk.
4047 := You don't think love can work?
4048 := Is that why you went to Kashyyyk?
4049 := No, I want to hear what you have to say.
4050 := I would never do that.
4051 := Well, I do. Spit it out, already.
4052 := Sorry. Maybe we can talk about it later.
4053 := You mentioned something about your 'adventuring days'?
4054 := So you weren't an adventurer?
4055 := You're just not used to company. Stop being an old coot.
4056 := I'm not a 'kid'.
4057 := How did that happen?
4058 := I still can't believe you actually did that.
4059 := How about nothing?
4060 := Where did you get the credits for all the supplies?
4061 := So you stole it?
4062 := Well that was pretty stupid of you.
4063 := Maybe it should have.
4064 := What happened then?
4065 := That was the day you what?
4066 := Bad memory, I take it?
4067 := Your wife? You were married?
4068 := Oh, I'm sorry...
4069 := Was it very dangerous?
4070 := You were a pilot, too?
4071 := A Jedi would never be a smuggler!
4072 := *You* were a smuggler?
4073 := You're right. I'd rather not be bored.
4074 := Yeah? Well old people love to talk about history. Proven fact.
4075 := But you've already said so much... I'm curious.
4076 := Fine. I won't you questions ever again.
4077 := You never did actually say why you decided to come with me...
4078 := Answer the question, old man.
4079 := Are you always going to be this elusive?
4080 := You know, I don't *have* to take you with me.
4081 := You looked plenty happy there, to me.
4082 := I don't believe you.
4083 := Move on to where?
4084 := No, really.
4085 := No, I guess not.
4086 := Damn right it is.
4087 := You could do that on your own.
4088 := Just keep your opinions on it to yourself.
4089 := What interest do you have in my future?
4090 := You know what my destiny is?
4091 := So you're coming along to *not* offer your opinions?
4092 := You got that right. I have enough Jedi watching me.
4093 := No, tell me more of what you see.
4094 := Nomi? Who's Nomi?
4095 := I don't need another mentor.
4096 := So... you're along as some kind of observer?
4097 := I don't bring you along for your amusement, you know.
4098 := Why did you decide to come with me?
4099 := So you wanted a ride on my ship?
4100 := Fine, forget it.
4101 := If you don't want to answer the question, old man, just say so.
4102 := No, seriously, tell me.
4103 := You're avoiding the question.
4104 := Is this a comment on my breath?
4105 := Did you annoy this person endlessly, too?
4106 := And you traveled with this man?
4107 := Is that what you see around me, too?
4108 := I never heard of him.
4109 := You're making all of this up!
4110 := Does this story have a point, old man?
4111 := Is there supposed to be some hidden meaning in this?
4112 := So why didn't you *leave*?
4113 := As boring as this story?
4114 := How young are we talking?
4115 := And? Go on.
4116 := You're kidding...
4117 := And what does that have to do with you coming with me?
4118 := But how can you even be sure Andor was responsible?!
4119 := I hate you, old man...
4120 := How did you know?
4121 := Andor killed Kraat, I take it?
4122 := So what do you think of Sunry's verdict?
4123 := No, not really.
4124 := Yes, of course.
4125 := I have a tape that shows Sunry killing Elassa.
4126 := Are you suggesting the tape was falsified?
4127 := Tell me about Sunry. How do you know him?
4128 := Can you make a healing kit for me?
4129 := Do you know anything about this place?
4130 := I want you to rejoin the party.
4131 := I want to switch you with another party member.
4132 := Carth! Carth Onasi, is that you?
4133 := Jordo?
4134 := It *is* you, isn't it? I knew it when I laid eyes on you! You old spacedog, how have you been? I thought for sure you'd be fighting on some ship out there.
4135 := I was. I crashed.
4136 := Ha ha ha! That's pretty rich. I can't imagine what it would take to keep you on the ground.
4137 := Must have something to do with your pretty friend, here, hey? How do you do, miss?
4138 := So, what are you doing here, Jordo? The last time I saw you was on, um... well, Telos, actually.
4139 := Yeah... it's a shame about home. Telos still hasn't recovered. The family and I moved on, and I'm working for Czerka now.
4140 := I didn't see you after... er, what I mean is, my condolences on your wife. I heard what happened. At least your boy made it through alright.
4141 := My... boy? You mean... Dustil?
4142 := Yes, of course. I saw him at my last stop, on Korriban, though he didn't recognize me. You... didn't know he was there?
4143 := No! Jordo, Dustil has been missing since the attack on Telos! Are you... are you absolutely certain it was him?!
4144 := Yeah. I'd recognize Dustil anywhere. Positive. He's, uh... he's joined the Sith, Carth...
4145 := What do you mean he's joined the Sith?
4146 := There's an academy for the Sith on Korriban. He's a student there. I saw him suited up in their outfit and everything. Sorry... I thought you knew.
4147 := No... no, I... I didn't. Well, thanks for telling me, Jordo.
4148 := Sure, no problem. Good to see you again, Carth. Hope everything works out with Dustil.
4149 := Dustil... Dustil is alive! We have to go to the Korriban academy and find him!
4150 := I don't know. I don't know why Dustil would be with the Sith... but I... I have to find out. There's simply no choice.
4151 := All this time I've thought he was... he must be a man by now...
4152 := Thank you. I... I just have to see him. I have to know what happened to him.
4153 := You think I don't know that? I just... if there's a chance we can try to find him... I don't want to wait to track him down, if possible.
4154 := Yes, of course. I saw him not long ago here on Korriban, though he didn't recognize me. You... didn't know he was here?
4155 := Sure am. We joined the militia together back on Telos. That was a lot of years ago, of course.
4156 := Oh, I apologize. You folks are probably busy, aren't you? I just wanted to catch up with Carth, that's all.
4157 := Must have something to do with your friend, here, hey? How's it going?
4158 := Nice to meet you, Jordo.
4159 := Are you sure that's wise?
4160 := I understand. We'll go as soon as possible.
4161 := We have other priorities, Carth.
4162 := You're a friend of Carth's, I take it?
4163 := Can we hurry this up...?
4164 := I do not have the answer to your question.
4165 := I do not know how to help you with that, I am sorry.
4166 := How may I be of assistance to you, Padawan?
4167 := Of course. If there is anything else, I am here to help.
4168 := What is it you would like to speak to me about?
4169 := I am wary of the Mandalorian. I do not trust him.
4170 := I am not! They are not to be trusted! They are brutes and savages and destroyers of worlds!
4171 := I have never trusted Mandalorians. They drove my parents from Cathar, aided the Sith and attacked the Republic. Their warped notions of 'honor' may provoke them to do even more heinous acts.
4172 := I do not know why you tolerate his presence on your ship. In truth, he has had some merit so far, but I am not certain it is worth the risk you take.
4173 := Eliminate? What? I never proposed to murder the man!
4174 := His kind may prove to be a danger to the galaxy again, but this man himself has proven acceptable so far. Merely keep your distance from him and watch him, so that he does not betray us.
4175 := That is true. But also I know his kind. This man he may be different, but...
4176 := I am not paranoid! My suspicions are justified. I dare not speak about it around him, though.
4177 := Speak to him? No, no!
4178 := Spoken to him? No! No, I could not.
4179 := Mandalorians are vicious of temper and easily provoked. I... I would not want to tempt his wrath.
4180 := I am not a coward! I fear no one and nothing! But you have not had to flee the destruction of your homeworld either, human.
4181 := I am sorry. It is just that I cannot stand to be around him for very long. I suppose I do not really dislike him, it is just...
4182 := The Mandalorians came and overran my world, they slaughtered my race... I cannot forget what they have done. Or forgive.
4183 := I can take care of myself! I do not need you to patronize me!
4184 := But it is gratifying to know that you value me as a companion that much.
4185 := This simmering anger and hatred for the Mandalores seems to have found a place in my heart, though. Sometimes, I worry...
4186 := If I fall and endanger you and the galaxy you must do what is right. If my death will defeat Malak, then that is what must be done.
4187 := But we are becoming too morbid too soon. We should not talk like this now. There is much yet we can do.
4188 := But we shall talk later I am sure.
4189 := Should that time come again, I would rather no one else do it than the one who redeemed me in the first place.
4190 := But still it eats away at me. I worry that I may yet again fall and endanger everything that I hold dear.
4191 := That I may fall to the dark side once again. That I may threaten you, the Republic... the entire galaxy.
4192 := If... If that time does come. And if i do threaten our task. It is only right that you should strike me down.
4193 := But... I thank you for your kind words. It is hard being alone all the time. To be accepted and welcomed is... flattering.
4194 := Maybe. Maybe not. I cannot forgive them for what they have done to me and my people.
4195 := In time Canderous may prove himself. But it will not be easy.
4196 := You are right, of course. You always seem to know what you speak of.
4197 := Taris was my home for many years. As much as I hated it, it was still home.
4198 := A rat-hole; a warren; a paradise. I suppose you could call it all these things.
4199 := For me it was hell...
4200 := To walk down the streets. To have people look at you in disgust; like an animal. Most did not know anything about me, but it was there all the same.
4201 := Because I was an 'alien'. Because I was different from them; frightening.
4202 := I doubt any of them had even seen my people before. So they persecuted me...
4203 := They looked down on me and my family. Charged us more for food. Would not let us walk their streets. They spat on us.
4204 := You are human... you could not possibly know.
4205 := What? You.. You are just like them!
4206 := I would not have thought you were so cruel as that.
4207 := It seems I was mistaken... I should have known things could not change for me that easily.
4208 := As it is the Council's wishes, I will accompany you. I will do my duty, and trust that you will do yours.
4209 := How can you say that? You have seen Taris, you know what kind of a scum infested hole it is.
4210 := For us there was no respite. No one to turn to.
4211 := That is true I suppose. But it much more obvious for someone like me.
4212 := There were no other Cathar on Taris. No one to talk to. No one to confide in.
4213 := Humph! But you must think me weak for saying this. But I am strong enough to admit it!
4214 := I... I do not know. I have been keeping it inside for so long. I thought you might understand. You do not seem to fit in exactly with the others. You are... different.
4215 := Bah! Maybe I am weak. To think that some stories of my stupid past could possibly interest you.
4216 := Maybe there is no point. Maybe I am just lost after leaving yet another planet. I apologize for my outburst. I will try to control myself next time.
4217 := I thank you. You are kinder than I would have expected... To put up with me using you in this way.
4218 := I hope that I will not use your time so badly in the future. Thank you.
4219 := I thank you for your concern, but...
4220 := But it was precisely the people who made it so bad!
4221 := You have no idea what it is like to have to live there for years...
4222 := I have been thinking much about our journey, and I am grateful and honored that you have accepted me with you.
4223 := I am not used to such unbiased acceptance from one who is nearly a stranger to me.
4224 := We Cathar do not make friends easily, or for long. Even on Dantooine, I remained alone. Not ostracized exactly, but... separate.
4225 := Wha...
4226 := Well, even if we do not speak that often, or are apart, I still feel a part of a team; this group you have assembled that accompanies you and Bastila on your quest.
4227 := It is... warming. I feel almost welcome. Needed.
4228 := You seem to be very decisive when it is required of you. It is reassuring to know that I can count on someone like you.
4229 := I feel that I could count on any of you. But you... you are the one who drew me back from the dark side. It is to you that I feel a debt.
4230 := And I SHALL make it up to you.
4231 := Yes... and that is my point. I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.
4232 := Just... Thank you for accepting me.
4233 := To be accepted so readily... I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.
4234 := What? But... I thought...
4235 := It seems I was mistaken... I should have known things could not change for me that easily.
4236 := As it is the Council's wishes, I will accompany you. I will do my duty, and trust that you will do yours.
4237 := Yes, it was. I find it difficult to speak of those things. I do not want to live that way ever again. And here it seems different...
4238 := In truth, I have lived in the Republic too long, and know little. I never met any others of my race other than my parents. But we are not diplomats. We do not deal well with groups. This situation is new to me.
4239 := It is an honor to be by your side and to see you redeemed from the dark path you had chosen before.
4240 := I have been doing well, I suppose. As well as I can. But I am more interested in you right now.
4241 := Do not mistake me, it is just that even though we have traveled together for a while, it seems I know next to nothing about you, personally.
4242 := Yes. Yes, I do. I more than most perhaps. But I do not know the stories of your past. Legends rarely are laid bare like that.
4243 := Oh. I see. It is because you wish to keep me at arm's length.
4244 := Are you worried about me turning to the dark side? Or do you merely not wish my company.
4245 := Whatever the case, I am sorry for presuming too much. I will remember my station from now on.
4246 := It did not come out the way I had intended.
4247 := We have been travelling together since Dantooine, but I know nothing of you before that. Would you... would you humor me and tell me a little about yourself?
4248 := Your humility is... astounding as always. So what can you tell me?
4249 := Hah. Humility. Please, if you would, indulge me.
4250 := Your job? Your childhood? Your life?
4251 := I am sorry if I am making you uncomfortable. I will fully understand if you choose not to answer.
4252 := I understand. I appreciate that you take the time to talk to me. I will be more considerate of your time in the future.
4253 := I greatly appreciate your taking the time to talk to me. How did you come to be on Dantooine?
4254 := Besides the obvious, of course.
4255 := Heh. Yes, I kind of figured that. From where? Oh wait... I remember...
4256 := Taris... It always seems to come back to Taris for me...
4257 := I am sorry... I get distracted. What did you do before Ta... before that?
4258 := A life in the army. Not my career of choice, though. We Cathar cannot seem to adjust to regimented organizations like the military.
4259 := But I have heard that it appeals to males of your species. Fighting, defending.
4260 := That is what we as Jedi seem to be called upon to do. Perhaps we are not as unalike as I had previously thought...
4261 := But in a way it does seem to have it's own romantic appeal. Defending the galaxy from evil.
4262 := Much as we Jedi do. So in a way, I suppose, we are more alike than not.
4263 := But again I seem to be wasting your time with my carrying on. I apologize.
4264 := I am sorry... I get distracted. I already know the tales of your exploits: how you defeated the Mandalorians in the war... and how you fell.
4265 := But now you have the chance to redeem yourself. To make a new page in your history.
4266 := So now, I suppose, that all does not matter. Only your life now does.
4267 := Your... family?
4268 := Please, forgive me... I did not mean to insinuate that I... that we...
4269 := I... I thank you for your concern, but I am still a bit shaken.
4270 := I am. I try to be strong, as one of my people should, but I know I am still weak inside.
4271 := More time would do me good. Time to distance myself from that anger.
4272 := I think that is why the Council agreed to send me with you. They think, perhaps, that in your company I will be able to free myself from it.
4273 := I do not come here begging for scraps from you! I will earn my way with you. You will see just how valuable I am!
4274 := I thank you for your concern and your acceptance. I will strive to prove that I am worthy of your company and trust.
4275 := I have been thinking about myself... about Quatra... and about my fall to the dark side.
4276 := I keep thinking that it was my anger that drove me that far, that nearly damned me. I look inside myself now and I can still see it, I still feel it.
4277 := Would you rather I fell again and attacked? Slaughtered you in your sleep like an animal?
4278 := I see in your pride you do not think that possible.
4279 := Very well, then! Keep your own counsel.
4280 := I think maybe, that I just need more time.
4281 := After my father died, my mother was left to support me alone. A single non-human woman, living in one of the worst, most violent slums on Taris.
4282 := It was not easy for her.
4283 := When my father was killed it seemed that something in her began to die as well.
4284 := She worked. She worked as hard as she was able, but over time she began to waste away.
4285 := I later learned that she was unable to get enough money to feed both of us, and had to start borrowing from the Exchange, a band of cutthroats and smugglers. But even that was not enough...
4286 := She hid what she was doing from me. She gave most of her food to me, so that I would be strong. But she herself was suffering deeply from it.
4287 := In the end she could go on no longer, and collapsed at the cantina where she worked one day.
4288 := She never recovered. There was nothing really that I could do for her... She left me no money, and no doctor would see her without being paid first.
4289 := I sat by her bed for days as she lay there dying. I never want that to happen to someone I care about ever again...
4290 := But there was still the money she had borrowed... She had never paid it back, and made no provisions for her death.
4291 := You must understand: the Exchange is brutal. They care nothing for the life of a sentient being. They are the major suppliers of slaves on Taris.
4292 := They thought it was appropriate that, with my mother owing them money, the debt should be passed on to me. And with no way to pay, they took me by force.
4293 := You have no idea what it is like to be bound like a beast and treated as such. It was the worst time of my life.
4294 := They treated me like livestock. They were waiting for a buyer to give them some credits for me when the Jedi came to fight the Mandalorians.
4295 := They acted as real Jedi should, not lecherous young men with too much time on their hands.
4296 := The Jedi could not abide by what they saw there, and drove the Exchange from the face of the world, freeing those of us imprisoned there.
4297 := But the Jedi soon left to fight their war. And I was left with a dream...
4298 := I swore that I would become a Jedi. As soon as I had enough money to do it, I bought passage on a freighter headed for Dantooine.
4299 := And we both know what has happened since then.
4300 := I am grateful to you for having given me the opportunity to fulfill my dream, rather than become what I hated.
4301 := Someday I may make it up to you, but for now, let us keep on the task at hand.
4302 := I have told you my life story already, what more could you possibly want to know? Well... there is one thing...
4303 := I did not want to mention it before, because I was unsure how you would react.
4304 := You... you will see. Perhaps...
4305 := If you do not want to listen, I understand. But hear me out first.
4306 := Do you remember when I told you of the Jedi who had come to my world to fight the Mandalorians?
4307 := They were recruiting soldiers for their crusade against the Mandalores. Many people joined them.
4308 := The main reason for that was their charismatic leader. The one whose troops freed me and let me dream of seeking out and joining the Jedi Order.
4309 := I... I idolized him and the stories they told of him. He was everything I had dreamed a Jedi could be. I still believe he was that way.
4310 := I was hesitant to talk to you about this because... well...
4311 := The Jedi had come to fight the Mandalores under the leadership of a powerful young Jedi... a Jedi named Revan.
4312 := You're the one who can't face the truth! Malak has to be stopped. How can I do that if I let myself be blinded by my feelings for you?
4313 := Yes... I thought you might react badly... But it was Revan.
4314 := THE Revan. The Jedi who turned to the dark side, became the Dark Lord of the Sith and was defeated by Bastila and her strike team.
4315 := You... you mean it, don't you? But how can I be sure you aren't making a mistake. I... I have to resist. I have to be strong for both of us.
4316 := I do not know what happened in the wars with the Mandalorians that turned Revan and Malak, or what they sought with these Star Maps, but the Jedi I knew was a paragon of the Order.
4317 := I am sorry, if this seems wrong to you, but to understand you must realize that Revan was as great as a Jedi could be. Whatever turned Revan must be terrible indeed.
4318 := I wonder if what we find at the end of our journey will turn us as well...
4319 := This is meaningless speculation I guess. I just wanted you to know what I held from you.
4320 := But rest assured that I will not hold back if our enemy is Malak, Revan's apprentice, or indeed even if it was Revan.
4321 := I will help you through all trouble. Such is the will of the Council... And my own.
4322 := Yes, it was you. I never saw you, else I would have recognized you, but it was your army that freed me from the slavers.
4323 := I cannot express how you have changed my life.
4324 := I cannot express how you have changed my life... or how much you mean to me.
4325 := But I will stay by your side through any trials that may come. Such is the will of the Council... and my own.
4326 := But I don't... I mean, I can't... Malak will...
4327 := Well, I mentioned before that my parents had fled to Taris. Perhaps I can tell you about that.
4328 := No there were not... having fled the birthworld of my species, my parents flew as far and wide as they could.
4329 := And so I was raised alone, knowing of my birthplace only the few stories my parents could tell, and seeing no other member of my species at all...
4330 := It all comes back to wars and fighting... the curse of your race, it seems...
4331 := In the early days of the Mandalorian war, there had been fighting closer to the Outer Rim worlds.
4332 := Cathar was there, yes. My people had a great reputation as warriors... and that appealed to the Mandalore version of 'honor'.
4333 := They sought to test themselves against us, I think... test themselves by bombing our world, slaughtering my people while they slept or while they ran.
4334 := They swooped down from space across the world, firing at anything that moved. They used ships in space to destroy all orbital facilities and bombard the surface.
4335 := We did resist, and in spite of their violent attack we did stave them off for quite a while.
4336 := But in the end we were doomed...
4337 := We were prepared! Just not for an invasion of that size... And we had counted on the aid of our allies. Of the Republic...
4338 := We were not members of the Republic. Cathar was beyond the edge of the Republic, in the Outer Rim. And besides, they could not have known.
4339 := Our interstellar communications were the first things the Mandalores hit. All other short-range communicators were jammed... we were on our own.
4340 := We knew what was coming. We had fought the Mandalorians in the first war against Exar Kun and the Sith. We knew there would be no mercy for us.
4341 := The most we could do was pack the few of our people who survived onto what few ships remained and send them off into space as fast as they could.
4342 := Most did not make it.
4343 := My parents carried me as a baby with them and were lucky enough to escape.
4344 := They fled as far as they were able, and eventually settled on Taris. They could stand running no further, I think...
4345 := But Taris was a horrible choice. Dominated by humans, intolerant of other species, it made everyday life unnecessarily hard.
4346 := No, it is not. But they had little choice. Each of us dealt with it in our own way.
4347 := Perhaps they were not. Perhaps they did not know better. It did not take long for things to get worse.
4348 := My father... my father turned to stimulants. He spent much of his time in local bars and dives.
4349 := But we are warriors. It runs through our blood. And when he was on stims he... he... he became foolish... he let his warrior nature get the best of him.
4350 := So he would get intoxicated, and he would fight, and finally one day he would die.
4351 := I don't need your sarcasm, or your pity! He died at the hands of another.
4352 := Killed by a man who provoked him into a fight and killed him like an animal.
4353 := I... I am sorry, I cannot talk about this any longer right now...
4354 := Well... I suppose I have not talked very much about the Jedi I met back home.
4355 := They, all of them, were so very... invigorating.
4356 := What?! You...
4357 := Bah! It is useless talking to you it seems! Come back when you are more civilized or when we have something to do.
4358 := If you do not wish to hear what I have to say, then find some other being to converse with!
4359 := They were so very alive. So full of hope and energy and zeal.
4360 := In retrospect I can see it was a little bit tragic...
4361 := These Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.
4362 := Well... yes... these Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.
4363 := But to us, they seemed invincible, especially their leader, who they talked about all the time. Paragons of light and justice, sweeping away all iniquity before them.
4364 := It was like looking at gods...
4365 := I was merely using poetic licence. Those Jedi...
4366 := I can only assume that was some misguided attempt at humor. I was using poetic licence. But those Jedi...
4367 := I know that! I was using poetic licence! But those Jedi...
4368 := They were enthralling... Everyone wanted just to touch them. Some people thought it would bring them luck.
4369 := Not that the peace they brought lasted very long...
4370 := Of course they left! They had a war to go fight, so that we would not all be killed by those psychotic Mandalorians!
4371 := The Jedi left. The people grew complacent. Those who had been wronged saw their chance at revenge... and so the cycle continues.
4372 := The oppressed become the new generation of oppressors. The human oppressed that is...
4373 := The non-humans were never treated well in any case... We felt the brunt of both administrations...
4374 := Yes but humans seem the most pervasive... the most consistent. They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!
4375 := What?!? Of course I can! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!
4376 := But no one looks out for the injustices we suffered! Oh, no!
4377 := But... I am sorry, I should not have outbursts like that.
4378 := No, it is not. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.
4379 := I... I thank you for your support. My outburst was uncalled for, but you did not lash back at me. You are a much better Jedi than I, it would seem.
4380 := But let us not speak more of this now. We should continue on our journey. Perhaps later we will talk again.
4381 := I know... And I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways again.
4382 := Don't you see? The very fact I mentioned it means it has its influence. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.
4383 := Of course it was! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!
4384 := How I came to be a Jedi? I am sure you would not find it very interesting... Are you sure you would like to hear?
4385 := My attempt at humility seems to fail around you. So be it then, go immerse yourself in something else.
4386 := Very well then. Perhaps some other time you might deign to be interested.
4387 := Well... It goes back a number of years...
4388 := Back on my homeworld we did not see Jedi very often, especially where I lived.
4389 := Bad enough that Jedi rarely came to that place.
4390 := It was not the homeworld of the Cathar that I lived on. My parents had long fled from that place, and perhaps that is a story for another time. Rather it was a human hive-world I was raised on.
4391 := The hind end of space. A pit of a world, to be sure. Where Jedi rarely tread...
4392 := But we had heard of them. Well, everyone had, so that is not to be unexpected.
4393 := Champions of truth. Defenders of justice. Heroes of the Republic.
4394 := It was very easy for a child to be enthralled by their image, their mystique. Maybe I was one of those children.
4395 := Allow children their innocence while they still may have it!
4396 := I was not so innocent, but I too was affected...
4397 := When I saw a Jedi for the first time they lived up to everything my imagination had created them to be. I was awed... and maybe a bit enamored...
4398 := From that moment on I knew that I would have to try to become a Jedi. To lift myself out of the rut I had been living in for years and to make a real difference, as the Jedi were.
4399 := The foolish delusions of a child. But THIS child made it happen!
4400 := As soon as I was able I left my world and went in search of them. I found them and was accepted. I had been living my dream on Dantooine for several years before you came.
4401 := Although... perhaps I was not entirely ready for it... or not completely suited to the task. Otherwise I would not have fallen...
4402 := But thanks to you I have been redeemed. Perhaps I may yet live to see that dream of mine come true.
4403 := Come, there is much we should do. Let us not waste time talking. Action is what is needed.
4404 := They were quite striking... especially the tales of their leader.
4405 := Yes... Yes I did.
4406 := There is little to tell. Dak and I were both Padawans... we joined the Order at the same time.
4407 := He was a kind man, but... frustrated. He felt the Jedi were too controlling, too limiting... more so than I did.
4408 := When he decided to leave the Order, he asked me to come with him. He... he said he loved me.
4409 := It was serious enough to him... and to me, for I did not wish to hurt him. I had little choice in the matter.
4410 := He was angry at my refusal. I... assumed that he would get over the hurt in time. I suppose such feelings can fester and darken, and they never go away.
4411 := He reminds me of what I was when you found me in the grove. I... feel sorry for him.
4412 := But he has chosen his path, hasn't he? If I thought he would accept an offer of help, I would give it. Let us... just move on, please.
4413 := I suppose the rest is obvious enough that I need not tell it.
4414 := No, I didn't. I enjoyed his company, as a friend, but nothing further. I had no idea he felt as he did.
4415 := I have heard of this world... Kashyyyk. It is a place of giant trees that have overgrown the entire world, blanketing it in greenery.
4416 := But while it is beautiful to behold at times, it can also be quite deadly. Many creatures and predators lurk in the leaves and branches. Some small, some undoubtedly quite large.
4417 := I have heard that the bottom layers of the trees have never been seen by a living being who returned to tell of it, and that travelling there is certain death. I do not envy any who go there.
4418 := It is most odd that Revan came here, but perhaps in the vast canopy of one of these trees we may find another piece of the Star Map.
4419 := I have heard of no indigenous race that inhabits this world, but I must profess my ignorance, since I have only heard its name in passing.
4420 := Tatooine is a filthy desert. Planets such as this should not be fit for life at all. My skin itches just to be here.
4421 := As you can see, it is a desert. Very little water. Too much sand. This sort of place attracts too much of the seedier side of civilization.
4422 := As to the particulars of this world itself, I can safely say that it holds no interest for me, and I will be well pleased when we leave here and never return.
4423 := Now is there something else, or may we hurry and do what we have to do here as quickly as possible?
4424 := Korriban, I have heard, is a mysterious world. It is rumored to hold many ancient ruins of a purpose that none have been able to discover.
4425 := There are also tales of strange ghosts and monsters haunting the ruins, whispering in the ears of all who would listen and driving them mad.
4426 := The Jedi are not welcome here, however, so we cannot determine the truth that may lie in these rumors.
4427 := Korriban remains staunchly outside the Republic, and we suspect that the Sith may have spread their influence here as well. The large Czerka Corporation outpost also points towards that.
4428 := If the Czerka Corp. is the industrial arms of the Sith Empire, then judging by the size of their facilities here, this may be a very dangerous world indeed.
4429 := We must watch ourselves closely here.
4430 := I am sorry, but I do not know anything about this place. It truly is an unknown world to me. I would be surprised if anyone at all in the Republic knew of it.
4431 := We should be on our guard at all times.
4432 := Manaan is a water-rich world... as you may have been able to tell.
4433 := With the exception of this Ahto city, there is no land on the world protruding above sea-level.
4434 := The dominant indigenous race of the world are the Selkath, a semi-aquatic bipedal species. They are known to be very dreary and strong proponents of the power of law above all else.
4435 := The extremist policies of the Sith seem to appeal to them. They have declared themselves neutral in this conflict between the Republic and the Sith.
4436 := The Selkath seek to preserve their independence by maintaining a stranglehold on the one unique resource of their world: the vulnerary liquid Kolto. The most powerful curative in the galaxy.
4437 := As the only world in the galaxy that produces Kolto, they have positioned themselves between the Sith and the Republic, supplying both sides with the medicine equally.
4438 := They hope in this way to make themselves too valuable to both to be conquered. As a last resort, they have made it clear to both sides that any attempt to attack their world will force them to destroy the Kolto supply entirely.
4439 := Any violation by either the Republic or the Sith of their sacrosanct laws incurs severe Kolto export restrictions on the violating government.
4440 := Both the Republic and the Sith try to keep the Selkath happy and give them no cause to complain. But I wonder how the Sith can take this affront to their power in stride...
4441 := Many people speak highly of the integrity of the Selkath people... but from what little I have seen of them, they are disgusting little fish-people. But I suppose I just have too high standards.
4442 := Dantooine? Dantooine has been my home for a number of years, ever since I started my training with the Jedi.
4443 := It is a lightly populated planet, mostly focused on agriculture and hunting of the wild beasts that roam its plains.
4444 := The most populous form of animals on its surface are the iriaz, herd beasts that are normally quite tame, but can be violent when provoked, and the kath hounds, vicious pack predators.
4445 := Kath hounds do not normally attack people except when it is a pack of them ambushing a lone individual. But recently they have been much more aggressive.
4446 := I am to blame for that, I believe.
4447 := But enough of my self-recrimination, I should not dwell on the past, but rather look to the future.
4448 := How may I be of further assistance to you, Padawan?
4449 := Yes? What is it?
4450 := Of course. I will assist you as I am able.
4451 := I am thinking of what happened on Korriban...
4452 := To see such horrible, warped rituals that the Sith practice... It is unnerving.
4453 := I can truly see now why we must defeat Malak as quickly as possible; to prevent that sort of society from consuming the entire galaxy.
4454 := It angers me to think of it.
4455 := Yes... yes, I understand: Do not let my passions and impulses rule me. Remain calm and serene.
4456 := But I fear that when I am confronted with these monsters I will lose myself.
4457 := I think that I may yet fall to the dark side by the very desire to fight it.
4458 := I know, I should not worry. I am grateful for your support in this matter.
4459 := It is a relief to have someone to turn to when I am feeling uncertain.
4460 := It seems that whenever I have a problem I turn to you. Sometimes... sometimes I almost seem to want problems, just for the chance...
4461 := But I am sorry, I should not speak of this.
4462 := Yes, it could be... if you look at it callously enough. But I cannot.
4463 := I am appalled at the things the Sith did there.
4464 := I cannot help but notice that your manner is increasingly like that of the Sith...
4465 := I am your companion. I am a fellow Jedi. I only seek to ensure the success of our mission.
4466 := But I do not believe it was. We should have been able to find another way.
4467 := I should have helped you find another path. I should have tried harder to stop you.
4468 := Maybe you should have... The fact that you think so gives me hope.
4469 := I hope that you will return to path of the Jedi... to me.
4470 := And I am sure that is exactly the same justification that Malak and Revan used before they fell...
4471 := Your overconfidence may yet be your downfall. I will still stand by your side, though.
4472 := I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.
4473 := I only wish that what I see meant more to you... that I could turn you back...
4474 := Will you try? ... For me?
4475 := Thank you. I am sure we can succeed together.
4476 := I... see.
4477 := I will still stand by you, as I have said before. I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.
4478 := I was remembering Taris...
4479 := You mock my pain! It was a horrible place to live... we had to go through hell every day just to survive, and you think it bothering me is an irritation?!
4480 := Your insensitivity speaks ill of your qualities as a Jedi. Still, as the Council ordered me to do, I shall accompany you, but expect no great sympathy for your plights.
4481 := It was a horrible place to have to live. At least in the lower cities where the non-humans tended to get relegated.
4482 := Living for years in a place with no sun, living off the trash dropped from the upper levels, and the meager pay doing back-breaking labor.
4483 := There were none. Bad enough to be a race that is feared and hated by humans, but to be one that is strange and different even among non-humans?
4484 := But living was hard enough without the stigma of being from a lost race.
4485 := There was always the danger of rakghouls coming up from the sewers, or more mundane predators living and working in the area.
4486 := My family and I struggled each and every day to make something of our lives, but we could only go so far.
4487 := Taxes from the corrupt government, more fees from the gangs controlling the streets, and whatever was left paying for what food and medical supplies we could afford.
4488 := It did not. But only because of the Jedi who came. It was very bad.
4489 := With no money to spare for any amenities, even the Enclave on Dantooine seems a paradise in comparison.
4490 := And of course there was the constant bigotry and hate from the more affluent and human citizens. Lording their wealth over us living below.
4491 := Every once in a while a rich human would come down through the lower levels with his droid entourage just to see how the 'wildlife' lived... and laughed at the mockeries that were our successes.
4492 := But I have come to meet many decent humans in my travels since those days. Indeed, some of the greatest people I have ever met are human.
4493 := I have noticed that. But the Jedi order seems to have collected a fair number.
4494 := Okay, you've made your point. Now shut up and kiss me, you fool!
4495 := The... the Jedi who encouraged me to join the Order, the one who was with the group going to fight the Mandalorians, she was human.
4496 := I... I suppose I see something of her in you when I look...
4497 := I am sorry... I am getting away from my point. If there even was one...
4498 := Sometimes I curse the day my parents fled to Taris. But then again, if they had not, I would not be where I am today.
4499 := Another story for another time. For now we must continue our own epic: To save the galaxy, if we can.
4500 := No, it is alright. I think I am over the worst of it. I apologize again for lashing out at you. It was not your fault.
4501 := I... have been bothered by something of late...
4502 := Someone else is not responsible for wiping out my homeworld by their actions. But who cares if it is because of you that everyone I have ever known off Dantooine is dead!
4503 := Someone else is not responsible for wiping out my homeworld by their actions. But who cares if it is because of you that everyone I have ever known off Dantooine is dead!
4504 := Fine! Then I will not! What does it matter to you if my homeworld was wiped out by your actions! Who cares if it is because of you that everyone I knew as a child is dead!
4505 := Taris! It was Taris that the Sith destroyed to try to kill you and your precious Bastila! Taris, my homeworld! Not that you care!
4506 := You... you animal! It is only because of the Council's will that I stay with you. But if you betray us, I may decide that falling to the dark side will be a small price to pay for letting my anger run loose.
4507 := Taris! It was Taris that the Sith destroyed to try to kill you and your precious Bastila! Taris, my homeworld!
4508 := It was my home!
4509 := The sacrifice of an entire world is too much for any cause! How would you feel if Dantooine or Alderaan or somesuch world were destroyed?
4510 := Would you be so callous then?
4511 := Oh yes, I have been told all about her vaunted powers with the Force. Her Battle Meditation that can turn the tide of any conflict.
4512 := Well if it could, then why could Taris not have been saved?
4513 := What did you think would happen by aiding the Republic?
4514 := If it were not for you and Bastila, the Sith would have never had reason to destroy that world! It was your fault for being there, and your fault for rescuing Bastila!
4515 := Without your intervention the Sith would have had no cause to lay waste to my childhood!
4516 := Just let me vent my anger! I need someone to blame... something... anything!
4517 := I hated that world, yet everything I learned as a child I learned there. It is as much a part of me as the air I breathe.
4518 := I have this ache inside me where all my childhood memories lay, and I find your face there with them. If it was not for you, that world would still exist!
4519 := There is no emotion. There is peace.
4520 := ... I suppose you did what you had to... and it could not have been avoided. The Republic needs you and Bastila. Maybe needs you more than it needed Taris.
4521 := I... I know... I suppose I realized that.
4522 := But it is so hard to lose your entire past. You would not understand.
4523 := I suppose that is to be expected. Everything will turn out for the best as long as we remain focused on our task.
4524 := Yes... Yes I suppose it will. As long as we remain focused on our task it will.
4525 := I am sorry. I will try not to distract you in the future with my trivial experiences. We should stop for now.
4526 := I never told you where I came from, did I? Where I grew up as a child? I suppose I was trying to deny what I was feeling.
4527 := You self centered fool! To think that I would desire to mate with one such as you, should that even be possible!
4528 := You are the center of the universe, what does it matter if my homeworld was wiped out by your actions! Who cares if it is because of you that everyone I knew as a child is dead!
4529 := I have been wrestling with my feelings inside. Trying to come to terms with it, but I find I cannot. I must have someone to blame!
4530 := Someone to blame for the destruction of my homeworld. Someone who is responsible for the death of everyone I have ever known except those on Dantooine!
4531 := I have heard of this world... Kashyyyk. It is a place of giant trees that have overgrown the entire world, blanketing it in greenery.
4532 := But while it is beautiful to behold at times, it can also be quite deadly. Many creatures and predators lurk in the leaves and branches. Some small, some undoubtedly quite large.

4562 := I am to blame for that, I believe.
4563 := But enough of my self-recrimination, I should not dwell on the past, but rather look to the future.
4564 := Is there anything else you need?
4565 := I have been thinking about our journey together, and how we are more similar than I had first thought.
4566 := Heh. I did not mean in appearances, but we have had some of the same experiences.
4567 := But similar enough. We have had many of the same sort of experiences.
4568 := I know how hard it was for me to resist the call of the dark side, and I know that you have suffered those pains as well.
4569 := The continual struggle between restraint and freedom... light and darkness. It is hard for me with my Cathar blood to resist sometimes.
4570 := I do resist. I look to you and see that we are in this together, and that you are resisting as well. That gives me strength.
4571 := I think the Jedi Council would be proud to see that you are holding up so well in spite of the hardships you have endured.
4572 := ... As am I.
4573 := I... I have been watching you for some time. I wonder if you have noticed.
4574 := I have been thinking of how far I had fallen, and how you exemplify the Code of the Jedi. I find my self ashamed.
4575 := Your power in the Force is strong, and I can sense no taint of the dark side in you. That makes my shame even worse...
4576 := But I have so little to show when I compare myself to you... and that makes my shame even worse...
4577 := That I had so easily fallen to the dark side. That I could convince myself that by injuring my master I became a great force of evil in the galaxy.
4578 := For my pride, my hubris. For the inner rage that all of my species feels. Sometimes I wish that I had not been born this way...
4579 := I am sorry. I start to talk thinking about how you stay strong to the path of virtue and justice, and I find myself whining again about my own inadequacies.
4580 := The Council would be proud to see that you had learned your lessons so well.
4581 := ... As am I.
4582 := I have been watching you... and I cannot help but feel that you are becoming more distant.
4583 := When we met it was you that convinced me to turn away from the lure of the dark side. But now it seems that you are falling into the trap that had caught me.
4584 := No. Please. I must speak.
4585 := When we first met I looked at you with contempt. You were some insect sent by the Jedi Council to eliminate me.
4586 := But you were more powerful than I would ever have thought. It seemed so easy for you to overcome me.
4587 := And this is just the problem! You seem to revel in your power, use it far too frequently for your own gain.
4588 := I... I do not know... I fear that you may be starting to fall.
4589 := I wonder if it started when you met me in that grove. I wonder if it could be my fault.
4590 := Maybe I do. I have had reason to wonder recently if I have had any effect at all...
4591 := I wish I could believe that as you do.
4592 := That is true. But still I worry about the ones you make.
4593 := But I have faith in you. I would follow you into battle with Malak himself. I will stand by your side.
4594 := If only there were some way I could turn you away from the path that you seem to be headed down...
4595 := That you did. You took away the dark taint that had been consuming me and restored me to the light. You took me away from there.
4596 := But now... now I wonder what it is that you see in your own reflection.
4597 := I look and I see you turning away from the Code of the Jedi. I wonder if you can see it.
4598 := I think that you flatter me again, and I do not know why. I worry for you.
4599 := I felt statisfaction taking revenge for my people like that... but... but I should not have let my anger consume me so.
4600 := No I didn't. I let my anger and passion consume me and did something rash. Something which leads me down the path to the dark side.
4601 := But... I recognize this, and I am truly regretful that I committed this act. I shall not let it happen again.
4602 := I suppose I was fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.
4603 := Yes... Yes I do. I must try harder in the future to resist such urges. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.
4604 := We should continue on our way. I do not want to linger around here anymore.
4605 := But I could have! I should have...
4606 := I must try harder in the future to resist the call of the dark side. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.
4607 := That man was a beast! A monster! I am glad that the galaxy is now rid of him, so that he may not harm others again.
4608 := I do regret, though, that he did not die by my hand...
4609 := I... I do not know anymore what I am strong enough for. I only take what comes to me and hope that I can handle it.
4610 := The lure of the dark side will always be my strongest foe. I should have killed him.
4611 := I know. But must I always fear the lure of the dark side?
4612 := But... it was for the best. I am glad that you stood by my side during this.
4613 := We should continue our journeys now. No reason for staying here for this.
4614 := My Cathar blood seethes at the thought of that man still running free. I cannot stand still while I think about it, but... but I will not give in to the dark side either.
4615 := He will pay for his crimes, though. He will most likely be following us... me. If we could find him first, then he may not be able to set in motion whatever he has in store for us.
4616 := So here we are... in the belly of the beast.
4617 := How... reassuring. I, though, would not have liked to die quite so soon.
4618 := We are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi. I am not favoring of our chances.
4619 := Here we are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi, and you wonder at my apprehension?
4620 := Knowledge of the almost certainty of my death tends to make me introspective.
4621 := If I am going to die here then, I am glad to have stood by you.
4622 := Yes. Yes, we should. Your focus on your work does you credit.
4623 := Let us leave this place then... If we can.
4624 := Live or die, I shall stand by you as you need me.
4625 := I only wish that we had had more time... together...
4626 := It is too late to do anything now. We must do what we can to escape from here.
4627 := When we have left, perhaps then we can see what the future holds for us.
4628 := I do not favor our chances at all. But if you believe that we can... then maybe there is a possibility.
4629 := Live or die, I shall stand by you as you need me.
4630 := I wish that I had more time to turn you from the path you seem to have chosen.
4631 := I hope that is true. Truly, I do.
4632 := But you have also fallen far from the ideals of the Jedi Order. Can you still do what is required of you?
4633 := Your steadfast desire for vengeance credits your perseverence, but I fear for you. It is too easy to give in completely to the dark side.
4634 := I know I worry too much, and I know you may be irritated by my saying this, but do not fall the way I did. You have so much potential, I do not want you to waste it.
4635 := But there is enough to worry about without my making it worse. Perhaps we can speak more of this later, once we leave this ship.
4636 := Your conviction is... compelling. But also disturbing.
4637 := If you will not listen to me, then to who? I admire you greatly, and respect your abilities...
4638 := If you will not listen to me, then to who? I respect your abilities, and I... I care for you...
4639 := I wonder if that is true. For your sake, I hope that it is.
4640 := This may be the last time I will have a chance to talk to you...
4641 := I just want to thank you for all that you have done for me. For saving me from the dark side, for accepting me on your journey.
4642 := I will help you in any way I can.
4643 := It is good to know that I have been of some value...
4644 := I will prove my true worth to you.
4645 := We WILL defeat Malak and save the Republic from the Sith threat once and for all!
4646 := I... defer to your wisdom in this matter. I have little knowledge of the true power of the Sith.
4647 := I pledge my life to your cause. I will stand by you until the end.
4648 := Even if not as much as I would like...
4649 := I just want you to know that I... that I...
4650 := Of.. Of course. I am sorry. I should have known better.
4651 := I can only say that if I am going to die, as we stand likely to, I am glad that it will be you beside whom I do it.
4652 := But I feel I must. I have never said this before...
4653 := I... I... I care for you. I do not know why. I do not know if anything will be possible or if you even return what I feel, but I do know it is there.
4654 := I am sorry if this upsets you. I am so sorry if I am wrong, but I cannot deny what it is that I feel.
4655 := I was afraid that I would have no more time to say it... I wonder if all of us wil survive what we must do...
4656 := I... I understand. You have someone somewhere... or I just do not seem to appeal to you.
4657 := I am sorry for pushing myself on you. I apologize for my actions.
4658 := I suggest we find and confront Malak as soon as possible to remove the threat to the Republic once and for all.
4659 := Now that I have put myself in this position, I know not what to say.
4660 := Yes. I thank you.
4661 := But as much as I may care for you, and you for me, first we must deal with Malak.
4662 := After there will be time to sort things out between us.
4663 := Yes. I thank you.
4664 := How... how can you possibly be Revan?
4665 := I knew when I heard that you had become the Dark Lord of the Sith that something was wrong with it.
4666 := The woman who saved me, who I... who I have come to admire, could never go completely to the dark side.
4667 := It is good to know that you have truly changed. It gives me hope.
4668 := I do not think now that I will fall to the dark side. I only have to look to you and follow by your example and there is no way I can fail.
4669 := I... I am sorry, I did not realize. I will endeavor to be more considerate in the future.
4670 := That is especially meaningful coming from you.
4671 := Thank you for placing your confidence in me. I only wish I had your heart as well...
4672 := I will never forget what you did for me, even if you do not remember it.
4673 := Yes. That is true. I suppose you would know better than I.
4674 := The woman who saved me, who I... I have come to care for, could never go completely to the dark side.
4675 := The man who saved me could never go completely to the dark side.
4676 := You are nothing like the one who saved me on Taris.
4677 := You are obviously not who I thought you were, once upon a time.
4678 := I thought you were the ideal Jedi. I thought you would never turn against us. Yet here you are.
4679 := You did turn in the end. I did not want to believe it. But now I suppose you have a chance to redeem yourself.
4680 := You can work with us. For the Republic. For the Order. We can set right what you started so long ago.
4681 := Only through serving the Republic do you serve yourself as well. In defeating Malak you save all of us along with you.
4682 := And I hope that what you see as necessary is what we originally set out to do.
4683 := Yes we shall. I only hope that you will see this through until the end.
4684 := Time will tell what choices you make. I shall stay by you to see this task done.
4685 := The one... the Jedi whose troops saved me on Taris... It was Revan, leading an army out to defeat the Mandalorians. It was you...
4686 := I feel I must apologize for the way I acted towards you before, in the grove. It was wrong of me.
4687 := I realize you have justification, but that anger only leads to the dark side. Please do not fall into the same trap that caught me.
4688 := I thought that too. But I was wrong...
4689 := The dark side is most devious and deceptive. It can find the smallest weakness to exploit.
4690 := I am sorry for attacking you. I am sorry for thinking you would only try to kill me.
4691 := I hope that by helping you in your task I may redeem myself in your eyes... and in my own.
4692 := You mock me! I will do what it takes to redeem myself in the eyes of my peers. I WILL succeed!
4693 := I will prove myself to you and to everyone! I will be a faithful companion to you and Bastila as long as our journey may last.
4694 := It may. But I am prepared to do what it takes.
4695 := I can only hope that, in our time journeying together, I will succeed.
4696 := Thank you... It is most reassuring to know that you can forgive me, even though I tried to take your life.
4697 := There is no time to talk now. Our priority is to find what caused this disturbance in the Force. It is close by, I know that much.
4698 := Nothing for now. Perhaps later.
4699 := I was wondering if we could talk.
4700 := Why are you so hostile towards Canderous?
4701 := You're delusional.
4702 := I am suspicious as well.
4703 := Perhaps we will have to eliminate him, then.
4704 := Fear and hate are lures of the dark side.
4705 := Do not become paranoid, Juhani.
4706 := Should I speak to him?
4707 := Have you spoken to him?
4708 := A cowardly, but rational choice.
4709 := A wise decision. We do not need internal conflict.
4710 := Just... that you are a coward. Why deny it?
4711 := You are afraid?
4712 := Just?
4713 := I would not let him harm you, Juhani.
4714 := I may be forced to strike you down, should you fall.
4715 := You should not worry. You can over your anger.
4716 := About what?
4717 := I think you will come to trust him in time.
4718 := Hatred and fear lead to the dark side, Juhani.
4719 := What?? Aren't the Cathar such fierce warriors?
4720 := You should not judge Canderous by other Mandalorians.
4721 := Canderous has proven himself.
4722 := He has proven himself well.
4723 := Wary? Why?
4724 := What are you thinking about?
4725 := How so?
4726 := Well you have to admit: You are a freak.
4727 := I find it a little hard to believe.
4728 := Humans can be just as cruel to each other.
4729 := Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying something important?
4730 := Wait a second. Why are you telling me all this?
4731 := You're right. Don't bother me with this drivel again.
4732 := It is interesting... I just fail to see the point.
4733 := No, it is alright. I will be here to listen to you whenever you want.
4734 := You are not weak, Juhani. It must have been hard.
4735 := Life is hard. You can't blame everything on other people.
4736 := I know some parts are bad, but...
4737 := Then you should be right at home when I turn my back on you.
4738 := And how are things different now?
4739 := You could try counting on one of the others, you know...
4740 := We are all in this together.
4741 := It is nice that you hold me in such high regard.
4742 := It's only because I haven't found out how to ditch you yet.
4743 := It must have been difficult for you.
4744 := Tell me about your people.
4745 := Are you doing alright?
4746 := Well you know my reputation.
4747 := There's a reason for these things, you know.
4748 := What do you want to know?
4749 := It is a little forward...
4750 := Heh. Well it is, of course, the greatest story ever told.
4751 := Is is not a very interesting story.
4752 := What is there to tell...
4753 := Damn right! It's none of your business!
4754 := Sorry, my life is my business.
4755 := No, it is alright.
4756 := Er... I flew to Dantooine?
4757 := I was in the Republic fleet that was destroyed over Taris.
4758 := Well I rescued Bastila on Taris...
4759 := I was a scout for the Republic armed forces.
4760 := I was a soldier for the Republic.
4761 := I was a specialist with the Republic fleet.
4762 := You're too fragile, Juhani.
4763 := Perhaps you just need more time.
4764 := Great, another mouth to feed...
4765 := If I see you begin to slip back, I will intervene.
4766 := I cannot afford to look after you all the time, Juhani.
4767 := Why? What is wrong?
4768 := You know, I don't really think I care very much.
4769 := If the taint cannot be removed, are you sure you should be here?
4770 := What happened after your father died?
4771 := Could you not help her?
4772 := What happened?
4773 := How so?
4774 := Surely there was a doctor.
4775 := What did you do for her?
4776 := Did she die?
4777 := They captured you?
4778 := You were enslaved?
4779 := Mmm... livestock, eh?
4780 := How could the Jedi stand for that?
4781 := And they freed you?
4782 := What was the dream?
4783 := What did you do?
4784 := You turned away from the dark side.
4785 := You became a Jedi.
4786 := Juhani...
4787 := Tell me more about your past.
4788 := Why would I react badly?
4789 := Do we really have time for this?
4790 := What is it?
4791 := Of course I remember.
4792 := Yes, you mentioned this.
4793 := How bad could this be?
4794 := Spit it out already!
4795 := Well what?
4796 := How could you admire Revan?
4797 := Revan?! You mean...
4798 := Why did you tell me now?
4799 := I shall never fall like Revan did!
4800 := Juhani...
4801 := There were no Cathar on Taris that I saw.
4802 := Why were there no other members of your species on Taris?
4803 := Why did they flee?
4804 := Go on.
4805 := Please do.
4806 := What caused them to flee?
4807 := Your people were in that region?
4808 := Near the world your species comes from?
4809 := The Mandalorians fought dirty.
4810 := Your world was taken that easily?
4811 := How did it happen?
4812 := And that is what you get for being unprepared.
4813 := The Jedi could have helped!
4814 := Why did the Republic not help you?
4815 := An atrocity!
4816 := What about your family?
4817 := But you survived?
4818 := Taris is not a nice place to raise a child.
4819 := Your parents do not sound very wise to me.
4820 := How did your family cope?
4821 := That's tragic...
4822 := How did he die?
4823 := He died?
4824 := Why do you insist on spewing this trash at me?
4825 := I already know about Jedi, talk about something else.
4826 := Invigorating?
4827 := Blah, blah, blah. Okay, you can stop now.
4828 := What do you mean?
4829 := Tragic?
4830 := If that was the case, they seem to be misrepresenting themselves.
4831 := Damn straight! I DO look divine.
4832 := The Jedi are not gods.
4833 := Did they leave?
4834 := What happened?
4835 := All species are capable of intolerance.
4836 := Well you can't really blame them.
4837 := It is alright.
4838 := Such anger can lead to the dark side.
4839 := As long as you do not let your anger influence you.
4840 := Was it that bad?
4841 := How did you come to be a Jedi?
4842 := You're right. It's going to be boring.
4843 := On second thought, maybe not.
4844 := Yes. Please continue.
4845 := Was it bad there?
4846 := What is the Cathar homeworld like?
4847 := Where did you live?
4848 := Typical childish naivete.
4849 := So what did you do?
4850 := The imagination can be a dangerous thing...
4851 := Enamored?
4852 := Then how did you gain entrance to the Order?
4853 := Did you meet a Jedi?
4854 := Tell me about this Dak Vesser.
4855 := That doesn't sound so serious.
4856 := Oh. Forget I asked.
4857 := But you didn't love him?
4858 := What do you know about this world?
4859 := Yeah, well evil always wins in the end anyway.
4860 := The Sith seem to have all the advantages.
4861 := Neutral? Can they not see the Sith are evil?
4862 := Nothing right now. Maybe later.
4863 := Is something wrong?
4864 := We are doing our job. Do not make it personal.
4865 := You should not keep worrying like this.
4866 := Do not fear, Juhani.
4867 := Now that's irony.
4868 := It angers me as well.
4869 := Do not give in to your anger.
4870 := I'm in charge and I'll do what I want.
4871 := Who are you to criticize me?!
4872 := What I did was necessary.
4873 := Maybe I should have done differently.
4874 := I tire of your criticism.
4875 := This is war. We do not have time for niceties.
4876 := I recognize the danger.
4877 := I will prove stronger than them!
4878 := I am not Revan!
4879 := I will try, Juhani.
4880 := No. I am sorry.
4881 := Get out of my face!
4882 := Not this again...
4883 := What about it?
4884 := I do not remember seeing any of your race on Taris...
4885 := That's horrible!
4886 := How did you survive?
4887 := And those rakghouls...
4888 := How could such a government last?
4889 := No one would help you?
4890 := Was it that bad?
4891 := Decent humans are hard to find.
4892 := One of the Jedi you met?
4893 := Like who?
4894 := And how did you arrive on Dantooine?
4895 := Fled? Fled from where?
4896 := Your parents?
4897 := I am sorry, Juhani.
4898 := You sure someone else can't help you?
4899 := Don't lay all your problems on me.
4900 := *Yawn*
4901 := What are you saying?
4902 := You mean...
4903 := I thought you hated your homeworld...
4904 := Sometimes you need to make some sacrifices.
4905 := Well... yeah, probably.
4906 := Bastila is critical to defeating the Sith.
4907 := I did not know the Sith would destroy Taris.
4908 := I am sorry, Juhani, I did not know.
4909 := We...
4910 := But...
4911 := I...
4912 := I have no excuse. I did what I needed to.
4913 := Calm yourself. Remember the Jedi Code.
4914 := I am sorry, Juhani. There was no way to prevent it.
4915 := You're right. I don't.
4916 := It will be alright, Juhani.
4917 := What is it?
4918 := You want to go someplace quiet to... get it on?
4919 := Are you hitting on me?
4920 := What?
4921 := What do you know about this world?
4922 := Yeah, well evil always wins in the end anyway.
4923 := The Sith seem to have all the advantages.
4924 := Neutral? Can they not see the Sith are evil?
4925 := I am nothing like you!
4926 := We are not that similar...
4927 := How so?
4928 := Do not force me to have to kill you.
4929 := Remain strong!
4930 := You must not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.
4931 := I am not so great as that.
4932 := You should not be so hard on yourself.
4933 := Ashamed?
4934 := You cannot change how you were born.
4935 := You have nothing to be ashamed of.
4936 := You should not think that way.
4937 := Shut the h...
4938 := Wha... ?
4939 := Juhani...
4940 := Yes, it was.
4941 := You overestimate your effect on me.
4942 := No, of course not.
4943 := We each make our own choices, Juhani.
4944 := My mission was only to cleanse the grove.
4945 := You were more of a challenge than you think.
4946 := You did the right thing.
4947 := At least you regret it.
4948 := You couldn't help it.
4949 := You weren't strong enough to do it.
4950 := What you did was best.
4951 := It would have been wrong.
4952 := I will not let them take me.
4953 := Do not worry, we will escape.
4954 := What is wrong?
4955 := Less talk, more escaping.
4956 := And I am glad to have had you by my side.
4957 := You are making me uncomfortable...
4958 := We will have time.
4959 := Juhani...
4960 := Do not worry, Juhani. We will escape.
4961 := We will have all the time in the world, Juhani.
4962 := I can do anything. Starting with destroying this ship.
4963 := When I get out of here, I will hunt Malak down like a dog.
4964 := I WILL defeat Malak!
4965 := I do not need you to judge me.
4966 := The choices I have made were necessary
4967 := You have proved your worth many times over.
4968 := I need you to help me, Juhani.
4969 := I value your companionship.
4970 := Do not underestimate the Sith.
4971 := We should get going.
4972 := And that is what we shall do!
4973 := Please stop. Now.
4974 := You do not need to say it, Juhani.
4975 := ... Yes?
4976 := Are you sure this is the time for this?
4977 := I am sorry, I cannot return your affection.
4978 := I feel the same way, Juhani.
4979 := We have gone past words.
4980 := Er... 'Thank you'?
4981 := You do not have to say anything.
4982 := Perhaps she had her reasons. But I do not.
4983 := You flatter me...
4984 := You will do fine, Juhani.
4985 := Overconfidence can also lead to the dark side.
4986 := I do not know who that Revan was. I am not her.
4987 := Perhaps he had his reasons. But I do not.
4988 := I do not know who that Revan was. I am not him.
4989 := I regret any of the harm I may have caused.
4990 := People change.
4991 := You know nothing of me!
4992 := I am who I am, Juhani.
4993 := I AM the ideal Jedi.
4994 := I do not make excuses for my actions.
4995 := Here I am.
4996 := I work for myself!
4997 := I will do what is necessary.
4998 := We shall see.
4999 := Next time you try something like that, I'll kill you.
5000 := Have no fear, I recognize the danger.
5001 := The dark side will not take me! I am too strong!
5002 := I am not as weak as you, Juhani.
5003 := Damn right! Apologize!
5004 := Ha! Unlikely.
5005 := I think it's going to take a lot for that to happen.
5006 := Do not worry, Juhani. I forgive you.
5007 := You thought the dark side had consumed you. It is nothing.
5008 := Mission? Is that you? It's me, Lena. Remember? I was dating your brother back on Taris!
5009 := Lena? What... what are you doing here? Where's Griff?
5010 := I'm just passing through. Griff and I broke up a few months after we left Taris together. Probably for the best. Your brother can be charming, Mission, but he's bad news.
5011 := Don't you start trashing my brother, you cantina rat! Take that back or I'll smack you so hard your head-tails will pop off!
5012 := Wha-?? Mission, what's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
5013 := Yeah, I know how she feels. Griff can be pretty frustrating. I guess that's why Mission didn't want to come with us when we left Taris.
5014 := You've got your facts a little backwards. Mission could have come with us if she wanted to! It was her choice to stay behind!
5015 := You liar! Griff told me you didn't want his little sister tagging along - that's why he had to leave me behind!
5016 := Is that what the Hutt-spawn told you? I wanted you to come with us, Mission. I even offered to pay for your ticket! Why not? I paid for everything else while I was with that freeloader.
5017 := But he told me you didn't want to leave Taris. I said we shouldn't even go then, but he said we'd come back and get you after we struck it rich on Tatooine - just another one of his lies!
5018 := No - you're the one who's lying! Griff wouldn't... he wouldn't try to leave me behind!
5019 := Think about it. If Griff wasn't trying to ditch you, Mission, then why didn't he tell you where we were going?
5020 := After we left Taris he told me looking after you was holding him back - Griff's always looking to blame other people for his own problems. That's why he abandoned you.
5021 := He did the same thing to me, too, as soon as I ran out of money. He started blaming me for all his problems. Like it's my fault his get-rich-quick schemes never work out!
5022 := But Griff is my brother! I can't just pretend he doesn't exist! If he was here to defend himself Lena wouldn't be saying all this bad stuff about him!
5023 := Still on Tatooine, as far as I know. Not that I really care anymore. And if Mission was smart she'd forget about that no-good con artist!
5024 := Hey, if you want to talk to Griff go ahead. Last I heard he was going to make a fortune working the Czerka Corp mines on Tatooine. But as far as I'm concerned he's out of my life forever!
5025 := Griff's better off without you anyway, you table-dancing, brother-stealing home wrecker!
5026 := *sigh* I guess that's my cue to leave, then. I didn't mean to upset you, Mission. But one day you'll see I'm right about your brother. I only hope it's not too late by then.
5027 := You damn well know it! He's nothing but a sleazy scam artist. If Mission knew what was good for her she'd forget he ever existed.
5028 := Mission gets a little worked up when it comes to her brother.
5029 := You took her brother away and left her all alone on Taris!
5030 := Maybe your brother isn't the man you thought he was.
5031 := Maybe he thought you were better off on Taris, Mission.
5032 := This isn't my problem.
5033 := So where is Griff now?
5034 := I'd like to hear Griff's side of things before I judge him.
5035 := Sounds like you're better off without him.
5036 := Why should we believe you, Lena?
5037 := Excuse me... I know it's been a very long time, dear, but aren't you Bastila, Helena's little girl? Yes - it is you! I can see it in the eyes. My how you've grown!
5038 := I am Bastila, yes. I take it that you know my mother?
5039 := Oh, yes. I worked for your father on an expedition years ago. Your mother showed me holos of you before you... well, before you left. Such a pretty little girl you were.
5040 := Is there something I can do for you, miss? As you can see, we are in quite a hurry.
5041 := Oh, I didn't mean to take up your time. I just wanted to ask you if your mother's condition has improved any since I saw her.
5042 := My mother's condition?
5043 := Oh, you... you don't know? Oh, dear. I just thought... I assumed that she had found you. When I talked to her last, she was desperate to find you...
5044 := I have not seen my mother since I joined the order. Do you know what has happened? Did she... say anything about my father?
5045 := I'm sorry, dear, but your mother is very ill. So she told me. She didn't say anything about your father, however. I didn't see him.
5046 := I see. Where did you meet her, do you remember?
5047 := I saw her on Tatooine, dear. She said she'd been there for awhile. Maybe she's still there?
5048 := Thank you for informing me. I really must be going, now.
5049 := It seems my mother has been looking for me. Strange. Should we get the opportunity, could we look for her on Tatooine?
5050 := I agree. Should we get the chance, however, I would speak to her. Perhaps it has something to do with my father.
5051 := It is important enough that my mother was attempting to seek me out. Perhaps it has something to do with my father. 
5052 := We never did. I am interested in hearing about my father, however.
5053 := Part of me would rather not see her at all. But if she is really sick... well, we shall see.
5054 := What's this all about?
5055 := Forget it. We've got better things to do.
5056 := Certainly, if you think it's important.
5057 := I thought you and your mother didn't get along?
5058 := Umm... are you sure you want to ask me about that?
5059 := Oh, heck, I don't know.
5060 := Hey, there. What can I do for you?
5061 := Okay... have it your way.
5062 := I want to thank you for helping me with Griff. You... you did everything you could for my brother. More than most people would have.
5063 := I know it might look like it didn't make any difference in the end... Griff's in debt and on the run like usual. But at least I know we tried to help him.
5064 := I can't say I blame you. But I'll be honest... I doubt you'll ever see Griff again. I don't even know if I'll ever see him again. Like all good con men he knows how to disappear.
5065 := My brother is what he is, but I've learned to deal with that. I'll never forget that he looked after me when I was just a kid, but I don't feel like I owe him anything anymore.
5066 := I've made my peace with Griff and what he means to me. If he ever shows up again I'll deal with him, but I'm not going to dwell on my brother anymore. It's time to move forward!
5067 := Don't worry, I see all Griff's faults plainly now. None of us is perfect, but I realize he's a little less perfect than most.
5068 := I know people can change no matter how bad they were. But I'm not holding my breath. None of us is perfect, but I've come to realize that Griff is a little less perfect than most.
5069 := I appreciate everything you've done for Griff. You know that, right? I just hope things work out for him this time around.
5070 := I guess we'll find out when he meets up with us at the Czerka Corp shop. If he's got those credtis he promised you then maybe there's hope for him yet.
5071 := Hey, if you want to help him with this Tarisian ale scheme that's your business. I'm washing my hands of the whole thing.
5072 := I'm worried about Griff and his latest plan. I've got a bad feeling about it. He doesn't know anything about brewing Tarisian ale.
5073 := And now he's gotten himself mixed up with the Exchange. Sometimes Griff can be so stupid! Part of me just wants to let him get what's coming to him.
5074 := Maybe a couple broken knee-caps will do him some good! Maybe that's the kind of jolt he needs to turn his life around! Only... what if they do something worse?
5075 := They might kill him! I don't want him to die; he doesn't deserve that. But I can't just keep supporting his crazy schemes. Someone has to teach him a lesson!
5076 := You're right! Griff may be my brother, but he deserted me on Taris. As far as I'm concerned that pretty much breaks any bond we had!
5077 := I'm not going to worry about Griff anymore. Like you said, he brought this on himself! Besides, he's always treated me like garbage. Now it's payback time!
5078 := Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm not going to change him. Griff is going to keep on being Griff. 
5079 := Maybe if we get these tach glands for him things will work out. Or maybe he'll finally see the light and turn over a new leaf. I know it's not likely, but it's all I have to hope for.
5080 := Why not? He turned his back on me! He abandoned me on Taris, so maybe I should just leave him high and dry now!
5081 := Look, I'm happy Griff's alive but I'm mad at him right now. And I don't know what kind of job he's got for you, but I don't trust him. It's probably just another scam!
5082 := Talk? What is there to talk about? Those sandpeople took my brother prisoner!
5083 := Griff may be a slime but we have to go rescue him! We can't just leave him with those... those... those monsters!
5084 := I know you're out to save the galaxy and all. But you can't just turn your back on someone who needs your help - you're a Jedi, not a Sith!
5085 := I can't make you go after my brother, but you're the only one who can save him. Just think about it, that's all I ask. In the end I know you'll do the right thing.
5086 := You heard the Czerka rep: the sandpeople sometimes take prisoners. Say what you want about Griff, but he's a survivor. I know he's still alive.
5087 := I knew I could count on you! There's definite fringe benefits to being friends with a Jedi!
5088 := I've been thinking about Lena and what she said about Griff. You know, how he was always blaming other people for his problems. There might be something to what she said.
5089 := No, of course not. Not really. But what if... what if it was his idea to leave me behind? I'm not saying Griff would just abandon me.
5090 := But maybe... maybe he did want to leave me behind. Just temporarily, you know? He might have done that, if he planned on coming back later.
5091 := But things didn't usually work out for Griff the way he planned, you know? And that's when he'd get in trouble. He was always borrowing money he could never pay back.
5092 := He might have been trying to skip out on his debts when he left Taris. He would have had to leave his little sister behind so it would look like he was coming back.
5093 := Yeah... well, no. Not exactly. Look, all I'm trying to say is that the more I think back the more I realize I might be idolizing my brother a bit. Not seeing all his faults.
5094 := I still want to find him. I need to see him again. It's just that I'm not sure how I'll react when I do.
5095 := Maybe. We'll see. I don't... I don't want to judge him yet. Maybe Lena was lying. Or maybe... maybe she wasn't.
5096 := All I know is I'd like to speak to Griff myself. If we have time, I'd like to go talk to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine and see what he has to say about where my brother is now.
5097 := Don't tell me you believe Lena's lies? Griff might be working as a miner on Tatooine, but the rest of her story is bantha poo-doo! You can't trust someone like her.
5098 := At least Griff's free of her clutches. I'd like to go speak to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine, if we have time. Maybe I can arrange to see my brother again.
5099 := Sure, I understand. Saving the galaxy and all. All I'm saying is if we get time to make a quick sidetrip to Tatooine... look, just think about it, okay?
5100 := I just hope he's not in any kind of trouble when we do.
5101 := I'm sorry for the way I acted before. It's just that when it comes to Lena I tend to get a little worked up.
5102 := My brother and me had a good thing going. Sure, Griff had his run-ins with the law on Taris. But we got by okay. Until Lena came and ruined everything.
5103 := She was a dancer at the cantina where my brother used to go to play Pazaak. Griff could be a real smooth talker, and it wasn't long before the two of them were dating.
5104 := But Lena was used to dating rich Tarisian nobles - guys with mountains of credits. Griff could never give her the kind of lifestyle she was used to, no matter how hard he worked.
5105 := I'm not going to pretend Griff wasn't a hustler and a con-artist, but that doesn't mean you can just insult him! He did what he did to look out for me!
5106 := I thought Lena would brush Griff off when she saw how poor he was, but for some reason she stuck around. I guess she saw the potential for a big payday down the road.
5107 := I saw Lena for what she really was - a busty, credit-grubbing cantina rat! She used Griff and took away the only family I had!
5108 := After they'd been together for a few months, Griff told me he was leaving Taris. He and Lena were going to try and make their fortune off-world.
5109 := He promised as soon as he made enough credits he'd come back and get me and we'd all live like royalty. That was two years ago - I haven't seen him since! I don't even know where he went!
5110 := Oh, I know what happened! As soon as she got him off Taris Lena sunk her claws into Griff but good! She twisted him around her little finger and made him forget all about me!
5111 := I know I'll probably never see Griff again. But part of the reason I came with you was the hope that I could find out what happened to my brother.
5112 := Don't worry - I won't let my search for Griff get in the way of what we're doing. Let's just get back to the task at hand. Is there anything else I can help you with?
5113 := I'm not really in the mood to talk about my brother right now. Maybe we should just stay focused on the job at hand, you know?
5114 := So, is there anything else you need?
5115 := I... I was a little snappish when we last talked. I'm sorry about that. I get a little touchy when it comes to Griff. It's kind of embarassing telling people about him.
5116 := Right, sure. I understand. We've got all this other stuff going on what with the Sith and all. You're busy. No problem. Maybe later we can talk. When you have more time, you know?
5117 := No, I want to tell you. Zaalbar's a great listener but it might be nice to talk about this with someone who doesn't reply in growls and grunts.
5118 := It's complicated. Griff wasn't the most popular guy, he had his faults. But I still loved him, you know? Sometimes people don't understand.
5119 := I never knew my parents, my brother always looked out for me. He's the one who brought me to Taris. I was just a kid, only five. But I remember the trip - if you could call it that.
5120 := We were stuffed inside a packing crate in a star freighter's cargo hold with just enough food and water to make the trip. Not exactly first class, you know?
5121 := Oh... yeah. I understand. We've got bigger bantha to hunt, right? I just miss Griff, is all. I keep thinking things might have been different, you know?
5122 := I don't know the whole story - I was pretty young. But my brother owed a lot of money. Might even have been a few arrest warrants out for him, I don't know.
5123 := The only way to get off the planet was to smuggle ourselves out. I mean, I don't want to make it sound like we were criminals... well, maybe my brother was.
5124 := See, this is why I don't like to talk about it. It makes Griff sound worse than he really was. My brother had his problems, but he always looked out for me.
5125 := He gambled. And drank. And he was always borrowing money for his latest get rich quick scheme. But he had a good heart, you know? He taught me how to survive.
5126 := He showed me how to slice into a computer's security system; how to get inside a locked building without the entrance codes, and how to spot a wealthy mark for a quick shell game.
5127 := Yeah, Griff did right by me.
5128 := Hey, you don't know what it's like! You need those skills here in the Lower City. Griff did right by me.
5129 := I really miss him since he left. I keep hoping he'll come back some day. He promised me he would.
5130 := Why do you got to go putting my brother down like that? That's just mean! Besides, it wasn't his idea to leave!
5131 := He fell in with a bad crowd. It's all Lena's fault. She's the one who took him from me! Just batted those long lashes at him and off he went!
5132 := Mission - mission: is that supposed to be a joke? Like I've only heard that about a million times in my life! Okay, I can take a hint. You don't want to hear anymore. That's just fine.
5133 := I don't want to talk about Griff and Lena - just the thought of that space tramp makes my blood boil! Subject's closed as far as I'm concerned!
5134 := If I'm going to be any help to you I can't be worrying about my brother running off with some intergalactic skank! So, is there something else you need?
5135 := Yeah - that's what I'm trying to say! Without my brother I don't know where I'd be.
5136 := Shouldn't we be more worried about getting Zaalbar back from those Wookiees? I don't trust that Chuundar character.
5137 := Really? You want to know about me? Nobody's ever really been interested in me before. What did you want to know?
5138 := Big Z's my family, you know? My parents... well, I guess they're dead. It was just me on my own until the day I saw Zaalbar in the Lower City. I could tell right away he was in trouble.
5139 := This was before the gang wars were out of hand, but even then the Vulkars were scum. A few of them were hassling Big Z, trying to pick a fight - but he wasn't looking for trouble. 
5140 := Fine - I won't tell how Zaalbar and I hooked up. Sheesh! First you ask about it, then you say you don't want to hear it! You're as bad as my brother used to be!
5141 := My brother's a touchy subject, you know? It just so happens I don't really feel like talking about him right now. Nothing personal. Let's just get back to the business at hand, okay?
5142 := Anyway, I don't like Vulkars at the best of times. And when I saw them picking on this poor Wookiee - all alone on a strange planet, overwhelmed by the big city - I just lost it.
5143 := I screamed out 'Leave him alone, you core-slimes!' and charged right at them. One of them saw me coming and slapped me so hard he just about knocked me cold.
5144 := Hey - don't treat me like I'm a little girl! I ain't no kid - I'm fourteen years old!
5145 := Those Vulkars didn't scare me. They're nothing but cowards. I knew how to deal with them. Of course, I never got the chance.
5146 := I guess Zaalbar didn't like seeing me get smacked around. He let out this howl and yanked that Vulkar a meter up off the ground and held him there by his throat. 
5147 := Are you kidding? Big Z ain't like that! He's just a big old softie inside. Of course, the Vulkars didn't know that.
5148 := The other two screamed and ran off. Can't say I blame them. The first time you see an angry Wookiee up close it isn't a pretty sight.
5149 := I thought Zaalbar was going to rip that punk's arms off and beat him to death with his own fists. The Vulkar was so scared he fainted. Or maybe Big Z's breath just knocked him out.
5150 := I keep telling Zaalbar to brush those choppers of his, but he never listens. Just stay upwind when he's speaking and you'll be fine.
5151 := Anyway, I knew those Vulkars would be back with friends, so I grabbed Zaalbar and we took off. Ever since then we've been a team. We look out for each other, you know? 
5152 := Yeah, I suppose you're right. Like I used to tell my brother, fast talk and slick words don't get the job done.
5153 := What's that supposed to mean? You think I can't take care of myself? I've got street smarts! I know how to get by on my own! 
5154 := In fact, I look out for Zaalbar more than he looks out for me, you know? Big Z's a little bit too gullible to make it alone on the mean streets of the Lower City.
5155 := He was fleeing some kind of trouble back on Kashyyyk. That's all I know, really. Big Z doesn't like to talk about it. In case you didn't notice he's the strong, silent type.
5156 := Doesn't much matter to me, though. I accept him for what he is, not what he was. Me and Zaalbar like to live in the present.
5157 := Mission!
5158 := Sorry Zaalbar, but I keep telling you to brush those choppers once in a while. Why do you think I won't stand downwind when you're talking?
5159 := Hey, I don't need a lecture from you. You ain't my mother! I knew what I was doing.
5160 := Hey, nobody said the Vulkars was smart. But there were three of them, so maybe they figured they could handle him. I don't know.
5161 := Sorry, I don't have one handy right now. Besides, we've got plenty of security spikes already. Not much point in overloading on them, is there?
5162 := No problem. Just so happens I've got one here I've been working on. Here you go... I'll just add it to our inventory.
5163 := Anything else you need?
5164 := Want to practice your skills, eh? Sure - I'll play you a few hands. Just for practice, though. I don't want to bet with you.
5165 := How am I supposed to know anything about this planet? It's an uncharted world in an unexplored quadrant! I didn't even know this planet was here!
5166 := Didn't you come here back when you were the Dark Lord? If you don't remember anything about this place then I guess we're just stumbling in the dark.
5167 := Manaan's the source for all the kolto in the galaxy; that's why those fish-faced Selkath can stay neutral in this whole Sith-Republic war. But I don't know much else about this place.
5168 := I always heard Tatooine was nothing but a rock covered by a bunch of worthless sand. I can't even figure out why Czerka Corp. set up their mining operations here.
5169 := I don't know anything about Korriban, but I get a bad feeling in this place. If there's such a thing as an 'evil' planet, this is it!
5170 := Well, I know Zaalbar's from Kashyyyk, but he never liked to talk about it. He wouldn't even tell me why he left. I don't think the Wookiees like outsiders much. 
5171 := I'm not the one you should ask about Dantooine. I didn't even know there was a Jedi Academy here; I always thought it was just a bunch of settlers and farmers! 
5172 := Sorry I can't be more help, you know? Is there anything else I can do for you?
5173 := Taris is a pretty good place to grow up, all things considered. Just stick to the area you belong in and stay out of Davik's business and you'll be fine.
5174 := Hey, no problem. I'm here to help, right?
5175 := I tend to keep my nose out of an intergalactic crime lord's business, you know? I can't tell you much that isn't common knowledge.
5176 := Extortion, slavery, smuggling: Davik's got a piece of all the action here on Taris. Even the swoop gangs know better than to get in his way.
5177 := It can be pretty nasty down there: you've got rakghouls crawling around looking for their next meal, and the Gamorrean slavers like to set up their bases in the sewers.
5178 := And then there's the Outcast village - a collection of people banished to the Undercity for their crimes. I mostly avoid the village, though; it's pretty depressing seeing how they live. 
5179 := What can I say? The Lower City was a great place to hang out until the Vulkars started that gang war. Now you can't even walk the streets without getting shot at!
5180 := The Upper City's got some nice shops and all, but it's boring! The only time I go up there is if I need free healing from Zelka at his medical facility.
5181 := Huh? Oh... sorry. I was thinking about Taris. I still can't believe it's gone! I mean, I grew up there and now it's... it's... it's just gone!
5182 := What? How can you be so cruel! Millions of people dead and you all you can say is 'get over it'?
5183 := Look, I'm not saying I can't go on or anything like that. It's just... it's a shock, you know? I mean, I knew the Sith were evil and all, but the reality of it kind of slaps you in the face.
5184 := But I suppose that's why we need to stop Malak, right? The more time I spend dwelling on Taris the more chance some other planet will get wiped out. I guess that's what it comes down to.
5185 := So don't worry about me; I'll be okay. And if you need my help against Malak or the Sith, I'll be there for you!
5186 := I don't really think there's anything you can say. I just have to find some way to deal with it, I guess. It'll take some time.
5187 := Yeah... I know. The Jedi got rid of Revan, so I figure Malak's days are numbered, too. But that doesn't make the pain go away, you know?
5188 := Nothing. Never mind.
5189 := I want to talk to you about your brother.
5190 := If I ever see your brother again he's a dead man!
5191 := I still hate that core-slime's guts!
5192 := That's a very mature attitude, Mission.
5193 := So you're okay?
5194 := I invested a lot in Griff. I'm still looking to get some payback!
5195 := Griff's a slime ball, Mission. Accept it.
5196 := Don't give up on him, Mission. He could still change.
5197 := You said it, Mission! Let the Exchange take care of that slime!
5198 := What do you care? He left you to die on Tais!
5199 := Whatever happens, he brought it on himself.
5200 := No one can teach him this lesson, Mission. He has to learn it himself.
5201 := You have to stick by your family, Mission. Even if they're slime sometimes.
5202 := You can't turn your back on your own brother!
5203 := I've got more important things to worry about, Mission.
5204 := He's probably already dead, Mission.
5205 := Don't worry Mission - we'll get him back.
5206 := Griff may not be perfect, but he is your brother, Mission.
5207 := You mean you believe her story now?
5208 := Kind of like how you came to Taris in the first place.
5209 := So he sacrificed you to save his own hide?
5210 := I think he deserves a swift kick in the groin for what he did.
5211 := When the time comes you'll know what to say, Mission.
5212 := I don't think we'll have time, Mission.
5213 := We'll find your brother, Mission.
5214 := What did she do to you?
5215 := Why do you hate her so much?
5216 := Did Lena dump him?
5217 := You mean no matter how much he stole.
5218 := So what happened?
5219 := Maybe she actually liked Griff.
5220 := Sounds like you're jealous.
5221 := We should get back to the job at hand.
5222 := Sounds like he deserted you.
5223 := Maybe something happened to him.
5224 := How is this Lena's fault?
5225 := I don't have time for this.
5226 := You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to.
5227 := Embarassing? Why?
5228 := I really don't care about your traumatic childhood.
5229 := How could your brother do that to a five year old?
5230 := You were stowaways?
5231 := What kind of problems did your brother have?
5232 := Pretty handy skills to have, Mission.
5233 := Sounds like he was nothing but a petty criminal.
5234 := Griff doesn't sound like he's big on keeping promises.
5235 := Why did he leave?
5236 := Let's get back to our mission, Mission.
5237 := What are you talking about? What happened?
5238 := Who's Lena?
5239 := He's family. You have to stick by your family.
5240 := I want to know a little more about you, Mission.
5241 := Where are your parents? Don't you have a family?
5242 := Could your story be more boring? I've heard enough.
5243 := I hope I don't have to listen to you prattle on about your brother now!
5244 := I didn't know you had a brother.
5245 := Go on.
5246 := That'll teach you to stick your nose where it doesn't belong!
5247 := Smacking a kid? Those Vulkars have no class!
5248 := Did Zaalbar kill him?
5249 := What did the other two Vulkars do?
5250 := We should get back to the task at hand.
5251 := How did you survive before you met Zaalbar?
5252 := How did Zaalbar end up on Taris?
5253 := You're lucky he didn't fry you with a blaster.
5254 := Who'd want to pick a fight with a Wookiee?
5255 := How did you and Zaalbar hook up?
5256 := I need you to make me a security spike.
5257 := Do you feel like playing some Pazaak?
5258 := Do you know anything about the planet we're on? 
5259 := Thanks for the info.
5260 := Tell me about Davik.
5261 := Tell me about the Undercity.
5262 := Tell me about the Lower City.
5263 := Tell me about the Upper City.
5264 := Taris is a wasteland - get over it!
5265 := I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
5266 := Malak will pay for what he did, Mission.
5267 := Beep-beep-beep.
5268 := Beep-beep beep woop!
5269 := Beep-beep beeple beep-beep! Woop!
5270 := Beep frotz. (Negatory)
5271 := Beep-beep beep.
5272 := Can you construct a programming spike for me, T3?
5273 := You can't make another one just yet? Got it.
5274 := There she is! Get her, men, but remember: don't kill her!
5275 := Ack! *cough* Heh, you seem to have defeated me, Cathar worm, but I'll have the last laugh in the end!
5276 := What do you mean?
5277 := He may not, but I will make him pay with what little time he has left! I will make him tell me what he has done to my people!
5278 := *cough* You may have killed me here, today, but I had the pleasure of killing off your species!
5279 := Not everyone who fought alongside the Mandalorians did it for their stupid concept of 'honor'. Some of us did it just for the pleasure: the pleasure of seeing your world burn.
5280 := You... you animal! You wretch!
5281 := *cough* *cough* Heh, but I'm beyond your petty vengeance now, girl. You can never have your revenge!
5282 := No! I cannot give in to my anger. I will not give him the satisfaction of making me that way.
5283 := Worm!
5284 := I killed your people on Cathar in the sky, on the ground, in their homes. I hunted them down like the animals they were, just to see them burn.
5285 := But the treacherous beasts fought back and left me with injuries that meant I could never fight again... or so they thought!
5286 := Hahah- *cough* *cough* But you won't! You're the cowardly type, all of you. You don't have the guts to finish me now!
5287 := No, I will not give in to him.
5288 := I ended up in the Lower City of Taris, and what did I find? A few of those stinking beasts living there!
5289 := The male was easy enough to best, but the females proved elusive. I didn't know what happened to them after I killed the male, until I saw this cursed woman on the auction block.
5290 := But then the Jedi came and ruined everything before I could have my revenge... *cough*
5291 := You... You killed my father, you killed my people, you treat us like animals... You deserve to die!
5292 := Give in and embrace your hate! You're no better than me! You're nothing!
5293 := I... I...
5294 := You... You will die for what you have done!
5295 := I... Help me, please! Do not let me give in to my anger again!
5296 := ... There is peace.
5297 := No, I will not do this. He may die, but it will not be out of my vengeance.
5298 := You coward! You weak... ahhh... gurk! *death rattle*
5299 := Haha! Your kind always were weak-minded!
5300 := I will not give him the satisfaction of seeing me give in to the dark side.
5301 := *grunt* What the hell is your kind doing here? Bad enough I have to deal with all these other idiots, but now there's a stinkin' Cathar on this world too?
5302 := I have as much right to be here as you do, SIR!
5303 := Ooooo! Big woman, the Jedi, shooting her mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.
5304 := Ooooo! Big man, the Jedi, shooting his mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.
5305 := Hiding behind your pet Cathar... And a woman at that!
5306 := We should have exterminated all you Cathar when we had the chance.
5307 := Heh, yeah, do like the Jedi tells you and back off! Your people are pathetic, it's no wonder we crushed your world so easily.
5308 := Wha... What do you know about my world?
5309 := I know enough that... Hey, wait a minute... you look familiar somehow...
5310 := What? You...
5311 := This doesn't concern you, Jedi trash.
5312 := Hm... now where could I have... No, he's dead and she likely is too. I...
5313 := What are you talking about??
5314 := Maybe I was wrong. Still, I think a specimen like you would be a nice addition to my collection.
5315 := So what would it take, Jedi, for you to sell your pet here to me?
5316 := Heh, I knew we could work something out.
5317 := I am not for sale!
5318 := Now don't be so selfish. We both know Cathar aren't real people anyway.
5319 := The females make amusing pets, but males should be put down like the animals they are. I remember one time on Taris...
5320 := What?! WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
5321 := WHAT DID YOU DO ON TARIS, YOU SCUM?!
5322 := Put one of you down like the animals you are. So easy... then I saw one of the females on the auction block, but those darn Jedi...
5323 := It was you!
5324 := What? Me? Oh ho! Now I recognize where I've seen that face before.
5325 := You were the little Cathar I was going to purchase. But those Jedi came and stole my pet away from me!
5326 := When I was fighting with the Mandalorians against the Cathar, I developed an appreciation for these creatures. They make excellent servants if properly trained.
5327 := You Jedi act all prim and proper, but inside you must feel the same way I do about the lesser, non-human species. The Sith at least let their feelings show on the outside.
5328 := You... My homeworld...
5329 := Come now, will you let your pet go? I'm sure we can come up with a price we both think is fair.
5330 := NO, I WILL NOT BE SOLD!
5331 := And I will see you dead for what you have done to my people!
5332 := Uh... hold on a second! Don't be hasty!
5333 := Yes, we.... NO! I must not fall prey to the dark side again.
5334 := ...There is peace.
5335 := I... I will remain calm. I am a Jedi now.
5336 := My lust for vegeance must be curbed.
5337 := Yes, yes... Say no to the dark side...
5338 := But I will have you yet! Heh.
5339 := Don't listen to him.
5340 := He doesn't have long, Juhani.
5341 := Yes, what do you mean?
5342 := You could kill him now.
5343 := We should just kill you now.
5344 := This isn't going to work.
5345 := Stop trying to provoke her!
5346 := Quit your whining!
5347 := Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
5348 := Do not give in Juhani. You are stronger than this.
5349 := Kill him now.
5350 := Do not do it, Juhani.
5351 := There is no emotion...
5352 := Just step away.
5353 := Just ignore him.
5354 := Do not give in to the dark side, Juhani.
5355 := A big mouth like that can get you killed.
5356 := Just ignore him, Juhani.
5357 := You annoy me, worm.
5358 := Well... what are you offering?
5359 := She is her own person.
5360 := She is not for sale!
5361 := Calm down, Juhani.
5362 := You were on Taris?
5363 := What are you saying?
5364 := What are you talking about?
5365 := You were buying Cathar slaves?
5366 := You bought Juhani?
5367 := Show me the money first.
5368 := Let's get him!
5369 := There is no emotion...
5370 := Do not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.
5371 := You'll only hurt her if I let her go.
5372 := She is not for sale!
5373 := We should just leave, Juhani.
5374 := Do you two know each other?
5375 := Do not seek to aggravate us.
5376 := I know nothing of what you speak.
5377 := I cannot help you with that.
5378 := Is there something you want?
5379 := Very well.
5380 := I am sorry, but I don't feel like talking. All I have seen tells me that my home is just as I left it. We are still enslaved.
5381 := For now, just let me think of what must be done. When I learn something new I will comment.
5382 := I will fulfill my life debt with you, but I don't think outsiders are worthy of knowing about me or my people.
5383 := I don't think I have to explain why. You witnessed what happened on Kashyyyk, what is still going on.
5384 := I am only a slave to you, just like my people are slaves. Well, Chuundar has shown me how to use you anyway.
5385 := Did we ask to be enslaved? Suffer like we have and then you can criticize how we dealt with this.
5386 := Chuundar has done what he must to ensure we survive. I see it now. He has shown me you can be used.
5387 := Chuundar showed me that you are all the same, all greedy, but I also learned that outsiders can be used. 
5388 := As long as you think you are leading, you don't care what those beneath you do. I will use this to my advantage.
5389 := I owe you a life debt, and I will honor it, but I will also serve myself. That is all I have to say.
5390 := You have seen more than I would have allowed, and taught me some things too. I am grateful for that.
5391 := It will be a while before I know what my role will be in making Kashyyyk truly free. I have a lot to learn.
5392 := I will follow.
5393 := I should get mad, but I won't. Your comment was callous, but you have shown you respect my people.
5394 := And it is that harshness of you outsiders that I must try to understand. I will follow undistracted while I observe.
5395 := You and I have important things to do, and I don't feel bad about leaving this time. I know I'll be welcomed back.
5396 := I'm not sure I really know. Father expects much of me... I guess I do as well.
5397 := I think, when I've learned enough, I'll bring it back to Kashyyyk. What happens then... we'll see.
5398 := I have said all I am going to. I will follow you as my life debt commands, but you are just another outsider to me.
5399 := I will honor my life debt, but I don't feel we share more than that. Mission may say more, but I will not.
5400 := Thank you.
5401 := A life debt is the greatest respect. I just don't think you could understand anything about me.
5402 := It is nothing personal, but I just don't feel you could understand anything about me.
5403 := The ways of my people are not for outsiders to know. You'll have to be content with that.
5404 := That may be, but not today.
5405 := All right, let's see what I can do. I think I have enough parts for something. Just a moment.
5406 := There you are. One grenade. Careful with it.
5407 := You've got a bunch already. You really don't want these things banging around together. Use some up first.
5408 := Unless you want someone threatened or a door bashed in, you should ask someone else.
5409 := I don't know much about the planets we visit, but... I suppose I should learn.
5410 := When you ask someone else, I will listen as well.
5411 := I know that it isn't my homeworld. That is all I care about. There is nothing here to interest me.
5412 := So many things have changed on Kashyyyk. I'm not sure what my place is. I must learn more about you outsiders.
5413 := Chuundar has told me much about our failures here. I think learning how to really live elsewhere will help.
5414 := And maybe... maybe I'll come back to fight... but not now.
5415 := When I know enough, I will understand how to best serve my people. I will travel with eyes open this time.
5416 := But, I leave with good feelings. My father will do what is right until I can return. And I will, when my life-debt is paid.
5417 := I have been away from Kashyyyk a long time, but things look the same as I left them. Slavers still hold my people prisoner.
5418 := I'm not sure what I could tell you. Or even what I would want to. You are an outsider here too. It angers me.
5419 := Nothing. Never mind.
5420 := Have anything more to say about yourself, Zaalbar?
5421 := Your attitude better not interfere with your service to me.
5422 := Perhaps the outsiders are to blame, but your people are complicit.
5423 := The slavers are responsible for what happened, not me.
5424 := I wish you well. Let's get going.
5425 := This nostalgia won't interfere with your service to me, I hope.
5426 := Never mind. Let's just get moving.
5427 := I'm sorry we can't stay on Kashyyyk longer.
5428 := Why did you request to take Bacca's Sword?
5429 := I want to know a little more about you, Zaalbar.
5430 := Then I will leave you be.
5431 := I saved you. I deserve respect.
5432 := You don't trust me?
5433 := You'll have to tell me more eventually.
5434 := I want you to make me a grenade.
5435 := I wonder if you could help me with a problem.
5436 := Do you know anything about the planet we're on? 
5437 := Maybe we'll talk later.
5438 := I heard the Sith are sending salvage teams down into the Undercity to recover those Republic escape pods.
5439 := I heard the gangs have overrun the Lower City. Why don't the Sith go down there and restore order?
5440 := I've got a ton of things to do today. I can't talk to you.
5441 := Don't - don't hurt my family! Just take what you want and get out.
5442 := Please, don't take me in for questioning... I don't know anything! I swear!
5443 := I heard a bunch of wreckage from the battle overhead crashed into the Undercity. Think of the damage it could have caused if it had landed here!
5444 := What's this, another off-worlder? I didn't realize how many of you there were on Taris until this Sith quarantine.
5445 := If the Sith wanted to get on everyone's good side, they'd go clean up the swoop gangs in the Lower City.
5446 := People complain about the Sith, but this quarantine is good for all the businesses on Taris. Look at Javyar's cantina. That place has never been busier!
5447 := I'm not looking for any trouble with you Sith. Please, just leave me alone.
5448 := I wonder if any of those Republic space pods survived crash landing in the Undercity?
5449 := Stay out of the Lower City. That place is overrun with gangs!
5450 := Taris used to be a nice place, before the Sith showed up and started bossing us around!
5451 := I remember when a person didn't have to worry about thieves rummaging through their home!
5452 := I'm... I'm sorry. I don't want to get in the way of official Sith business.
5453 := I heard the Sith are sending salvage teams into the Undercity. I heard they're looking for Republic survivors to take prisoner.
5454 := Ever since the Sith quarantine Javyar's cantina is packed with off-worlders! It never used to be that busy.
5455 := I heard there's a swoop gang war in the Lower City! They say you can get shot just walking in the streets down there!
5456 := I can't believe the Sith put a quarantine on the planet! It's bad enough we can't leave, but all you off-worlders are stuck here, too!
5457 := I'm not doing anything wrong! I'm just standing here... you Sith can't arrest me for that!

5630 := The common Badger is a small but fierce mammal. Its strong forelimbs are armed with long claws, used for both digging and self-defense.
5631 := Badger
5632 := Combat Suit
5633 := Even the most frugal of mercenaries know they need at least some protection from the rigors of combat, although suits of this type are recommended for light skirmishes only. 
5634 := Zabrak Combat Suit
5635 := A Zabrak improvement on the combat suit, this armor is good protection where speed and unrestricted movement are more important than bulky plating.
5636 := Echani Light Armor
5637 := Echani prefer elegant design to brute force. The Maktites learned this when their stores of thermal weapons were rendered ineffective by simple changes in the Echani light armor.
5638 := Cinnagar Weave Armor
5639 := A complex organic weave protects this armored suit from extremes in temperature. Armor similar to it proved decisive in defending Cinnagar from the Sith under Naga Sadow.
5640 := Massassi Ceremonial Armor
5641 := Long-term domination by the Sith has erased the memory of the Massassi rituals for which this armor was designed, but it retains its effectiveness on the battlefield regardless.
5642 := Darth Bandon's Fiber Armor
5643 := Special:
Upgradeable, Armor

Despite the unfortunate fate of Darth Bandon, this light armor remains a desirable asset for any warrior. The silvery polish reflects a pride in craftsmanship rarely seen today.

5645 := Special:
Upgradeable, Armor

Despite the unfortunate fate of Darth Bandon, this light armor remains a desirable asset for any warrior. The silvery polish reflects a pride in craftsmanship rarely seen today.
5646 := Heavy Combat Suit
5647 := This version of the combat suit offers more protection than the basic model. It is heavier overall and not quite as flexible, but many consider the tradeoffs worthwhile.
5648 := Bonadan Alloy Heavy Suit
5649 := Bonadan is an emerging industrial society financing their exploration of the galaxy through production of small arms and armor. They favor heavy materials offering solid defense.
5650 := Zabrak Battle Armor
5651 := In northern Iridonia the Zabrak produce expensive armor that nonetheless has become very popular on the galactic markets, due to excellent low-temperature defensive properties.
5652 := Zabrak Field Armor
5653 := This is a higher-quality version of the basic armor produced by the Zabrak. These were often reserved for field commanders, and meant to be easily identified on the battlefield.
5654 := Reinforced Fiber Armor
5655 := Inspired by craftsmen on worlds where metal is in short supply, this type of light armor consists of jung-ju tree fibers bound with synthetics, offering good, flexible protection.
5656 := Ulic Qel Droma's Mesh Suit
5657 := After killing his brother during the Exar Kun war, Ulic Qel Droma abandoned this armor and all the trappings of his service to the dark side. It's a powerful, if tainted, item.
5658 := Eriadu Prototype Armor
5659 := Special:
Upgradeable, Armor

This armor combines good protection and easy movement to create an impression of competence about the owner, but Eriadu has delayed general production pending further tests.
5660 := Special:
Upgradeable, Armor

This armor combines good protection and easy movement to create an impression of competence about the owner, but Eriadu has delayed general production pending further tests.
5661 := Special:
Upgradeable, Armor

This armor combines good protection and easy movement to allow even a novice to fight like a seasoned veteran, but Eriadu has delayed general production pending further tests.
5662 := Military Suit
5663 := This standard issue suit provides good protection, but can be heavier and more restrictive than some of its counterparts. Even so, many mercenaries swear the tradeoffs are worth it.
5664 := Echani Battle Armor
5665 := This armor provides solid defense at the cost of some flexibility, although it is still an Echani product and is therefore well suited to quick-moving combat.
5666 := Cinnagar War Suit

5942 := Verpine Ocular Enhancer
5943 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

The Verpine only manufacture this product for export, having no need of it themselves. They have highly evolved sight, a quality they smugly say the visors mimic but do not exceed.
5944 := Bothan Sensory Visor
5945 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

Bothans place great importance on the tools of the information trade. They would consider these items to be of average quality, though their standards are exceptionally high.
5946 := Vacuum Mask
5947 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

Intersystem travel is commonplace, but the inherent dangers should not be forgotten, especially in times of war. Many consider these to be essential equipment for spacefarers.
5948 := Sonic Nullifiers
5949 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

Replacing bulky ear protection, these items make use of newly developed counterwave-nullifiers, an innovation pioneered by shipyard workers, not the military.
5950 := Aural Amplifier
5951 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

With this item, Durkish Corporation abandoned visual detection in favor of aural, citing that most creatures breathe, and even camouflage fields can't blend the sound of that away.
5952 := Advanced Aural Amplifier
5953 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

In a fine balancing act, this unit amplifies the faint sounds of moving creatures, while filtering out louder background noise that might otherwise deafen the user.
5954 := Neural Band
5955 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

Developed after the Exar Kun war, this item bolsters the willpower of the user by electrically reinforcing established mental patterns. Republic troops called it "Little Shocky".
5956 := Verpine Headband
5957 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

Not subject to Republic regulations, the Verpine increased neural band effectiveness with brute electrical force. The market is there, but long-term effects on users are unknown.
5958 := Breath Mask
5959 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

This is standard issue gear for Republic forces and most professional soldiers, protecting against a variety of gas-based attacks.
5960 := Teta's Royal Band
5961 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

This "royal band" is attributed to Empress Teta, a warrior leader of Cinnagar. She was instrumental in defeating the Sith in the Great Hyperspace War over a thousand years ago.
5962 := Medpac
5963 := A medpac contains essential equipment for the treatment of wounds. They cannot be used by droids. Basic medpacs heal 10 vitality points + user's skill in Treat Injury.
5964 := Advanced Medpac
5965 := An advanced medpac contains an improved array of equipment for the treatment of wounds. They cannot be used by droids. Advanced medpacs heal 20 vitality points + (2 x user's skill in Treat Injury).
5966 := Life Support Pack
5967 := A life support pack contains dermal regenerators and other equipment for the treatment of wounds. They cannot be used by droids. Advanced medpacs heal 30 vitality points + (3 x user's skill in Treat Injury).
5968 := Antidote Kit
5969 := This kit contains wide-spectrum antidote hypospray injectors designed to neutralize all known poisons. Lowered attribute scores are returned to normal and physical damage is halted. Damage already suffered must still be healed by other means.
5970 := Antibiotic Kit
5971 := This kit contains an array of hypospray injectors filled with a broad chemical mix that quickly overwhelms viral or bacterial infections, effectively curing most known diseases.
5972 := Keycard
5973 := Keycards are the standard method of accessing most of the technology used in Republic space. Each card has a specific purpose and is designed to be almost tamper-proof.
5974 := Computer Spike
5975 := These items allow a user to slice computer programs, assaulting systems with garbage data to overwhelm security measures. They are one-use items. A high Computer Use skill reduces the number of spikes required for any given task.

5982 := Security Spike Tunneler
5983 := This one-use item employs anti-encryption software and electronic interference to improve the user's ability to bypass locking mechanisms on doors and containers.
5984 := Torch
5985 := A wooden stake wrapped in oil-soaked rags that can be ignited to provide a light source.
5986 := Flash Mine
5987 := Flash mines explode in a blast of light and sound that can temporarily blind or deafen, as well as inflict damage. The user must have adequate skill to place them effectively.
5988 := Frag Mine
5989 := When triggered, frag mines spread shrapnel across a wide blast range, inflicting painful physical damage. The user must have adequate skill to place them effectively.
5990 := Laser Mine
5991 := When triggered, laser mines launch a small emitter that inflicts energy damage on a wide area. The user must have adequate skill to place them effectively.
5992 := Gas Mine
5993 := When triggered, gas mines emit a noxious cloud of poisonous neurotoxins, affecting everyone nearby. The user must have adequate skill to place them effectively.
5994 := Adhesive Grenade
5995 := Damage:
Bludgeoning, 36pts
Secondary:
Entangle for 15sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC25 to negate entangle

These grenades cover the target area in a gooey bio-adhesive that slows or traps anyone caught within the effect. It quickly degrades, allowing allies to soon pass unhindered.
5996 := Blaster Carbine
5997 := Created initially by Gungis X Weapons, blaster carbine rifles have become very popular in recent years, helped by falling prices due to competition from other companies.
5998 := Sith Assault Gun
5999 := This is a modification on the blaster carbine rarely seen outside of Sith-controlled space.
6000 := Cinnagaran Carbine
6001 := This blaster rifle variant is one of many fine weapons produced by the factories of Cinnagar in their continued militarizing after the Great Hyperspace War a thousand years ago.
6002 := Jurgan Kalta's Carbine
6003 := The Zabrak mercenary Jurgan Kalta commissioned this rifle, a weapon he liked to think of as "amusingly destructive".
6004 := Jamoh Hogra's Carbine
6005 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

This was the weapon of mercenary Jamoh Hogra, and was supposed to protect him against the many enemies he earned in his lifetime. Hogra's skill didn't match its potential, however.

6011 := The most common ranged weapon in the galaxy is the basic blaster pistol, firing a bolt of intense coherent light powered by a replaceable power pack.
6012 := Mandalorian Blaster
6013 := The Mandalorian Blaster is a slightly more powerful version of the basic pistol common throughout the galaxy.
6014 := Arkanian Pistol
6015 := This is a versatile blaster variant possibly of ancient Arkanian origin. The Arkanians are very proud that such early efforts continue to be prized among collectors and soldiers.
6016 := Zabrak Blaster Pistol
6017 := This blaster is the staple of the Zabrak mercenary, known for deadly accuracy and exceptional damage.
6018 := Bendak's Blaster
6019 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

This blaster belonged to Bendak Starkiller, a duelist legendary on Taris. It is a highly adaptable weapon, and is definitely of better quality than any standard issue pistol.
6020 := Special:

This blaster belonged to Bendak Starkiller, a duelist legendary on Taris. It is a highly adaptable weapon, and is definitely of better quality than any standard issue pistol.
6024 := Blaster Rifle
6025 := More powerful than the commonly available pistol, the blaster rifle is favored by soldiers throughout the galaxy. Civilian ownership of these weapons is not generally encouraged.
6026 := Sith Sniper Rifle
6027 := Despite its effectiveness, these modified blaster rifles are not often employed by the Sith. They prefer to engage their enemies up close and personal.
6028 := Mandalorian Assault Rifle
6029 := These weapons are almost overpowered for their size, but the Mandalorians prefer them that way. They do not make a habit of being subtle in their war making.
6030 := Zabrak Battle Cannon
6031 := These weapons are almost beginning to cross the line to light artillery. Armor is generally ineffective against such a weapon, unless it is of the highest quality.
6032 := Jurgan Kalta's Assault Rifle
6033 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

Jurgan Kalta wanted to make a big noise in the galaxy. If it was the screams of his enemies, all the better. This weapon was his favorite because it shared his adaptability.
6034 := Special:

6038 := Bowcaster
6039 := The bowcaster is the invention of the Wookiees of Kashyyyk. Also known as a laser crossbow, the bowcaster uses a magnetic accelerator to hurtle an explosive missile at its target.
6040 := Chuundar's Bowcaster
6041 := Chuundar's personal weapon is a bowcaster with some unusual Czerka modifications. Most Wookiees would likely not appreciate such outside influence.
6042 := Katarn Slam
6043 := Claw1d4
6044 := Claw1d6
6045 := Claw1d10
6046 := Claw2d12
6047 := Claw3d6

6053 := Veerkal Bite
6054 := Tuk'ata Bite
6055 := Gizka Bite
6056 := CryoBan Grenade
6057 := Damage: Cold, 24pts
Secondary:
Paralyzation for 15sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC15 for half damage, negates paralyzation

A CryoBan grenade releases a supercooled liquid that freezes on contact, causing intense pain and damage to victims caught in the effect.
6058 := Double-Bladed Lightsaber
6059 := These exotic weapons are rare, and most often associated with Jedi attracted to the dark side of the Force, for whom reckless aggression is sometimes considered an asset. The double-bladed lightsaber is capable of inflicting more damage - but is also less precise - than the single-bladed variant.
6060 := Double-Bladed Sword
6061 := A difficult weapon to master, the double bladed sword has a grip in the center with two long blades emerging from either end. The double-bladed sword is capable of inflicting more damage - but is also less precise - than the single-bladed variant.
6062 := Echani Ritual Brand
6063 := Echani Firedancers use the double bladed Ritual Brand in a dodging and slicing pattern so graceful it looks more like a dance than combat.
6064 := Krath Double Sword
6065 := Twisted by the dark side, the Krath favored weapons of fearsome appearance requiring brute strength to wield, and the blades of this weapon are certainly effective, if not elegant.
6066 := Ajunta Pall's Blade
6067 := Held by the Dark Jedi even before he fell to the dark side, this may be one of the few truly personal items owned by Ajunta Pall, and remains as thoroughly corrupted as he.
6068 := Disruptor Pistol
6069 := These pistols are illegal in many planetary systems, being regarded as too powerful a weapon to be owned by civilians. Disruptors reduce solid matter to its constituent molecules. Unlike typical blasters, disruptors ignore most types of personal energy shields.
6070 := Mandalorian Ripper
6071 := A similar weapon belonged to Jigger Wraith, a bounty hunter that plagued the Republic years ago. 37 Mandalorians were executed for being him until sightings declined.
6072 := Disruptor Rifle
6073 := This disruptor is even more destructive than its pistol counterpart, and is outlawed on just as many worlds. Disruptors reduce solid matter to its constituent molecules. Painfully. Unlike typical blasters, disruptors ignore most types of personal energy shields.
6074 := Zabrak Disruptor Cannon
6075 := Zabrak always command respect, especially with the aid of weapons that are even more damaging than already-outlawed standard disruptors. Unlike typical blasters, disruptors ignore most types of personal energy shields.
6076 := Plasma Grenade
6077 := Damage: Heat, 36pts
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC15 for half damage

These grenades release a quick burst of an incendiary agent that ignites immediately, damaging all enemies within the area of effect.
6078 := Plasma Grenade
6080 := Frag Grenade
6081 := Damage: Piercing, 24pts
Area of Effect: 4 meters
Range: Medium
Save :
DC15 for half damage

Fragmentation grenades are very basic. They explode when thrown, showering the enemy in shrapnel. It's not elegant, but it's definitely effective.
6082 := Gaffi Stick
6083 := Hold Out Blaster
6084 := Sometimes called a "sleeper," the hold out blaster is the preferred method of temporarily incapacitating an enemy.
6085 := Bothan Quick Draw
6086 := An unconscious opponent is a quiet opponent. This weapon is a Bothan favorite, designed to "create opportunities."
6087 := Sith Assassin Pistol
6088 := These weapons are designed to incapacitate so death may be quick or lingered upon as desired. Droids are simply dispatched, as cruelty is best rationed among the living.
6089 := Bothan Needler
6090 := For serious espionage, this is the weapon of choice. Simple ownership can get you arrested in some systems, or invited to dine with royalty, depending on what it helped you learn.
6091 := Heavy Repeating Blaster
6092 := This weapon again increases the firepower available to the foot soldier or mercenary, but it is not for the lightly armored that wish to be quick on their feet.
6093 := Mandalorian Heavy Repeater
6094 := With this weapon, the Mandalorians again demonstrate a complete lack of subtlety. The only thing better than a big blaster apparently, is one that shoots faster.
6095 := Cassus Fett's Heavy Pistol
6096 := Heavy Blaster
6097 := These resemble regular blasters in the same way Quoorian marshsuckers resemble mosquitoes. Sure, they both do damage, but the former definitely has the edge in kill-potential.
6098 := Arkanian Heavy Pistol
6099 := Arkanian designs of this kind predated mass acceptance of heavier pistols, but 2000 years later they are still superior performers.
6100 := Zabrak Tystel Mark III
6101 := The Zabrak killed many pirates who were attempting to seize shipments of these weapons and then sold them on the black market anyway. It's not a matter of where they end up, but of who gets paid.
6102 := Mandalorian Heavy Pistol
6103 := Mandalorians boast that a shot from one of these pistols can take a starship out of commission. It's an obvious exaggeration, but for safety's sake, most listeners just smile and nod.
6104 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

Cassus Fett was rarely seen without this adaptable blaster. Famous for killing the captain of a flagship Republic frigate at the Battle of Jaga's Cluster, he is presumed dead.
6105 := Special:

6109 := Ion Blaster
6110 := Unlike a typical blaster, this weapon fires a stream of energy very damaging to electrical systems, causing havoc on the internal components of droids.
6111 := Verpine Prototype Ion Blaster
6112 := Demonstrating this weapon, the insect-like Verpine destroyed legions of droids, doing nothing to quell the public's suspicions of what testing their stun guns must have been like.
6113 := Ion Grenade
6114 := Damage: Ion, 48pts
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC15 for half damage

These grenades emit an extremely strong burst of energy devastating to any droids or personal shields unfortunate enough to be caught in the effect.
6115 := Ion Rifle
6116 := Any well-stocked militia usually has stores of ion rifles in reserve. They aren't much use against the living, but if the enemy has battle droids these weapons become essential.
6117 := Bothan Droid Disruptor
6118 := Droids can be difficult obstacles for a spy, but these weapons take all the guesswork out of dealing with them. 
6119 := Verpine Droid Disruptor
6120 := While they may have borrowed liberally from designs the Bothans initiated, the Verpine say you can't argue with results. These weapons are simply devastating against droids.
6121 := Lightsaber
6122 := Traditionally associated with the Jedi, the lightsaber is a devastating weapon difficult to master. Properties can vary with the type of focusing crystal used in construction.
6123 := Long Sword
6124 := Here is where the roots of the lightsaber begin, with traditional swords still wielded today in many primitive cultures. They are simple, but still effective in the right hands.
6125 := Krath War Blade
6126 := Twisted by the dark side, the Krath tempered swords with the power of the Force perhaps even before lightsabers became the weapon of the Jedi, both dark and light.
6127 := Naga Sadow's Poison Blade
6128 := The mere presence of Dark Lord Naga Sadow would come to imbue his personal weapons with the taint he carried, poisoned as his spirit was.
6129 := Blaster Pistol: Null
6130 := Heavy Blaster: Null
6131 := Ion Rifle: Null
6132 := Light Repeating Blaster: Null
6133 := Blaster Rifle: Null

Secondary:
Poison, 5pts every 6sec
Duration: 36sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC25 for no effect

This grenade unleashes a blast of poison gas that affects the nervous system, lingering in the air to ensure that the effect is not escaped easily.
6137 := Quarterstaff
6138 := Usually just a smooth staff of wood or light alloys, this is a very simple weapon of ancient design.
6139 := Massassi Battle Staff
6140 := The Massassi were a proud race altered by the Sith millennia ago, and subsequently exterminated along with Exar Kun. This weapon was the symbol of a proven warrior.
6141 := Raito's Gaderffii
6142 := This may have belonged to a Sand People warrior famous among his kind for killing a young Jedi, but the one tribe that kept the oral history of this event was wiped out long ago.
6143 := Light Repeating Blaster
6144 := This weapon allows the user to fire more quickly than usual, increasing his chances of survival without drastically changing the amount of equipment he would normally carry.
6145 := Blaster Cannon
6146 := The blaster cannon is a favorite among those that have become wealthy enough to hire experienced, dangerous crew and might need a way to take them out quick if things go bad.
6147 := Crystal, Rubat
6148 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Used in lightsaber construction, rubat crystal is mined on Phemis. It produces a clearly defined blade that a Jedi can easily focus on.
6149 := Crystal, Damind
6150 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Found on the desert world of Daminia, this crystal can be used in lightsaber construction to produce a clearly defined beam of subtly wider width and length.
6151 := Crystal, Eralam
6152 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Once mined on the third moon of Erai, ancient Sith bombardment shattered much that remained. If they can be found, these crystals produce a clear, superior lightsaber beam.
6153 := Crystal, Sapith
6154 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

This crystallized material was excreted once every 11 years by the ancient Volice worm of Lwhekk, now extinct. It produces a more intense lightsaber beam, granting better control.
6155 := Crystal, Nextor
6156 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

This crystal is mined in the mountains of planet M'haeli, and when used in lightsaber construction it produces a volatile blade that can cause surprising amounts of damage.
6157 := Crystal, Opila
6158 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Found in the asteroid fields of the Fyrth system, this crystal can be used in lightsaber construction to produce an intense beam that seems extraordinarily quick to the cut.
6159 := Crystal, Jenruax
6160 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

The refined form of Opila, this crystal has been cleansed of all impurities. When used in lightsaber construction it produces a blade of unerring quickness.
6161 := Crystal, Phond
6162 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
 
The strange byproduct of rare impurities bonding during the making of certain alloys and some random external condition, this crystal produces a fiercely burning lightsaber beam.
6163 := Crystal, Luxum
6164 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Ambria was a world in the grip of the dark side. Through years of mental battle, strange Jedi Master Thon contained the evil to Lake Natth. Long meditation can form this powerful crystal from the tainted water.
6165 := Crystal, Firkrann
6166 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

This heavy crystal is collected by the natives of Rafa V. If used in lightsaber construction it produces an electrically charged beam that is much easier to manipulate than standard beams.
6167 := Crystal, Bondar
6168 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

This crystal was mined on a far-orbit asteroid circling the Alderaan system. It produces a volatile lightsaber beam that pulses on impact, discharging part of its energy into an opponent.
6169 := Crystal, Sigil
6170 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Mined in the Sigil System, this crystal is a costly but valued addition to a lightsaber. It produces a fiercely bright beam that sears on contact, inflicting great damage.
6171 := Crystal, Upari
6172 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Strangely, this crystal is usually encountered scattered in the orbit of primarily forest worlds. It is brittle but versatile, and a Master Jedi can get it to produce many effects.
6173 := Short Lightsaber
6174 := Lightsabers can come in shorter styles, often used in the off hand during two-weapon fighting. As in larger versions, different focusing crystals can produce additional effects.
6175 := Short Sword
6176 := Disregarded by most modern warriors, a good short sword can still serve well in combat if the user is skilled.
6177 := Massassi Brand
6178 := During the reign of Naga Sadow the Massassi were transformed into foot soldiers for the Sith. This was their traditional weapon, altered, as they were, to serve the dark side.
6179 := Teta's Blade
6180 := Attributed to Empress Teta, these knives speak of her background as a warrior, and of her willingness to be on the frontline of the Great Hyperspace War a thousand years ago.
6181 := Sonic Grenade
6182 := Damage: Sonic, 36pts
Secondary: Stun for 9sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC15 for half damage, negates stun

These grenades explode loudly, but the majority of their effect is delivered in extreme frequencies the ear can barely perceive, even as it is damaged.
6183 := Sonic Pistol
6184 := Sometimes referred to as "squealers," these weapons deliver a high-frequency jolt to the senses that can damage and potentially disorient an opponent.
6185 := Bothan Shrieker
6186 := This is an improvement over the standard sonic pistol design that must seem doubly shrill to the large ears of the Bothans.
6187 := Sonic Rifle
6188 := More powerful than the pistol, the sonic rifle fires a blast of sound that causes a great deal of sensory overload in addition to damage, disorienting the victim.
6189 := Bothan Discord Gun
6190 := This was conceived as a "last resort" weapon should espionage fail and a quick retreat be called for. It is effective, but the Bothans would prefer that it not be needed.
6191 := Arkanian Sonic Rifle
6192 := The Arkanians pioneered many non-lethal weapons that could disorient opponents, but most were retrofitted to be superior damage dealers as well because the initial demand for them was so low.
6193 := Stun Baton
6194 := A common weapon, stun batons do minimal damage but can incapacitate a target. The high-density cells needed for repeated discharge are unwieldy, making it unusable in the off-hand.
6195 := Bothan Stun Stick
6196 := A useful tool for espionage, this weapon is more effective than the standard stun baton, but is still available on most worlds. High-density discharge cells make this item unwieldy and unusable in the off-hand.
6197 := Bothan Chuka
6198 := A very effective device used by Bothan elite. Some systems consider simple possession of one as grounds for execution as a spy. High-density discharge cells make this item unwieldy and unusable in the off-hand.
6199 := Rakatan Battle Wand
6200 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

Weighted to fit a Rakatan grip, this item is most like a stun baton. It seems more adaptable than one of Republic issue, though similar high-density cells make it unwieldy and unusable in the off-hand.
6201 := Special:

6204 := Concussion Grenade
6205 := Damage: None
Secondary: Stun for 9sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC20 for no effect

This type of grenade explodes in a concussive wave of force that can render anyone in the area of effect temporarily senseless.
6206 := Thermal Detonator
6207 := Damage: Energy, 60pts
Secondary: Knockdown
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC15 for half damage

This Republic device contains a baradium explosive that produces a small fusion energy explosion of great force. Civilian possession of these items is outlawed almost everywhere.
6208 := Vibro Double-Blade
6209 := Ultrasonic vibrations make this double-bladed sword exceptionally deadly, and a rare Echani cortosis weave protects it against lightsaber sparring damage, ensuring effectiveness even against Jedi and Sith.
6210 := Sith War Sword
6211 := Though most favor lightsabers, some Sith prefer the more visceral feel of metal cutting flesh. These blades are usually impregnated with rare cortosis to protect against lightsaber sparring damage.
6212 := Echani Double-Brand
6213 := Excess energy from the generator in this vibrosword is conducted through the blades directly. Also possessing a rare lightsaber-deflecting cortosis weave, this weapon is a deadly Echani masterpiece.
6214 := Yusanis' Brand
6215 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

Yusanis was the most famous of Echani warriors, fighting against oppression and villainy until encountering Darth Revan. Discovering that Revan had killed an Echani senator, Yusanis attempted to tell authorities but fell to the powers of the Sith Lord, despite his own impressive abilities and the cortosis weave inherent in all Echani vibroblades.

6219 := Vibroblade
6220 := Small size makes this a good off hand weapon. Echani vibroblades use a rare cortosis weave to prevent lightsaber sparring damage, allowing traditional swordplay to continue in the time of Jedi and Sith.
6221 := Krath Blood Blade
6222 := Twisted by the dark side, this Krath weapon is as deadly as a modern vibroblade. It was meant for assassination, and a cortosis weave that prevents lightsaber sparring damage ensured that even Jedi must respect it.
6223 := Echani Vibroblade
6224 := These blades are typically used in the off hand. In addition to a cortosis weave that deflects lightsaber sparring damage, some Echani vibroblades are supercooled to keep them in alignment, giving them an icy sting.
6225 := Sanasiki's Blade
6226 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

Sanasiki used this weapon to kill Nelinik, a Zabrak who assassinated the Echani High Protector with battle droids. Cortosis protects the blade against lightsaber sparring damage while energy cells disrupt droid opponents.
6227 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

Sanasiki used this weapon to kill Nelinik, a Zabrak who assassinated the Echani High Protector with battle droids. Cortosis protects the blade against lightsaber sparring damage while energy cells disrupt droid opponents.

6230 := Vibrosword
6231 := Ultrasonic generators power this Echani-developed weapon design. A rare cortosis weave that protects against sparring damage ensures that traditional swordplay will endure in the time of lightsabers.
6232 := Krath Dire Sword
6233 := This was a weapon of distinction in the time of the Krath. Protected against lightsaber sparring damage, Sith would grant these cortosis-laced blades to only the most loyal underlings.
6234 := Sith Tremor Sword
6235 := Traced to the Bladeborn, a Sith offshoot dedicated to sword mastery, these cortosis-laced weapons were given to "masterblades" who survived no less than ten lightsaber-wielding warriors in combat.
6236 := Echani Foil
6237 := These swords were crafted to honor Raskta Fenni, the best Echani duelist of her time. Many were sold, but imperfections in the difficult lightsaber-deflecting cortosis weave caused few to survive.

6310 := You summoned me, Lord Malak?
6311 := The search for Bastila is taking too long. We cannot risk her escaping Taris. Destroy the entire planet.
6312 := Th... the entire planet, Lord Malak? But... there are billions of people on Taris! We'd be slaughtering countless innocent civilians. Not to mention our own men still on the surface.
6313 := Your predecessor once made the mistake of questioning my orders, Admiral. Surely you are not so foolish as to make the same mistake?
6314 := No of course not. I... I will do as you command. But it will take several hours to position our fleet.
6315 := Then I suggest you begin immediately. You are dismissed, Captain.

Yes, Lord Malak.
6316 :=     
6317 := Admiral Karath
6318 := DarthMalak
6319 := cut03_start
6320 := Jedi Enclave
6321 := The Council must be told about what we have discovered! Meet me in the Council chambers.
6322 := The Council has finished its deliberations and are waiting. We should see them now.
6323 := The vision again! Did you see it? You must have. Revan and Malak were here before us - I feel their dark presence. They must have come and found... this.
6324 := It's a map of hyperspace coordinates. Some sort of star chart. But what is this Sith Star Forge they mentioned? And why did they lust to uncover its secrets?
6325 := Maybe... that might explain how the Sith were able to amass a fleet so quickly...
6326 := Whatever this Star Forge is, it was important enough for Revan and Malak to betray the Jedi. This Star Forge must be the seat of their power. If it could be destroyed...
6327 := Such thoughts speak of the dark side! We serve the Republic and the Jedi Council. It must be their decision as to what course of action to take.
6328 := The hyperspace coordinates on this map might lead us to the Star Forge, if they were complete. But there are pieces missing.
6329 := I recognize one of the planets on the map: Korriban - a Sith world. And if that's Korriban, then this must be Kashyyyk... and Tatooine... and here's Manaan...
6330 := Now I think I understand. This map was only the starting point for Revan's dark journey into the ways of the Sith. 
6331 := Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan, Korriban: Revan visited each of these worlds searching for clues to reveal the hidden location of the Star Forge.
6332 := Before we do anything we must inform the council of what we have discovered. They will decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.
6333 := I have spoken briefly with the Council; they request an audience with you. We should go at once.
6334 := An audience with the Jedi Council? That's pretty unusual for someone who isn't even a Jedi. What's this about, Bastila?
6335 := I'm sorry, Carth, but I cannot tell you. All I ask is that you trust in the Force and the wisdom of the Council.
6336 := Well, I don't like being left out of the loop, but I'm not looking to get you in any trouble with the Jedi Masters. We'll do things your way for a while.
6337 := Come, they are expecting us. I will lead you to the Council chambers.
6338 := We have done as the vision directed. When we pass through this door we will learn the secret uncovered by Malak and Revan.
6339 := Nothing seems to be happening. If we focus our minds together, we may be able to call on the Force and witness the vision of Malak and Revan once more.
6340 := As you wish - though a Jedi must not be afraid to turn to the Force when in need of guidance. 
6341 := Open yourself to the power. Let the Force flow through you.
6342 := This is the entrance we saw in our dream. The Force has shown us how to open these doors through our visions. 
6343 := This looks like a door... but I don't see any way to open it
6344 := Ahlan Matale has a reputation for being very temperamental. You must be the model of diplomacy when you speak to him.
6345 := Look at all these crystals - so beautiful, and so powerful. Each crystal gives off a different energy stream, so choose wisely when selecting the one for your lightsaber.
6346 := Dantooine looks peaceful enough, but packs of kath hounds roam these plains. We would be wise to keep our guard up while we are out here.
6347 := It looks like some sort of map...
6348 := What does it mean?
6349 := What is it?
6350 := Who said it had anything to do with the Sith? They may have allies in the background helping them now.
6351 := Could it have been a factory, or weapons plant?
6352 := Destroyed? If it could be harnessed...
6353 := How can we destroy it if we don't even know what it is?
6354 := So we're back at square one?
6355 := Can't you tell anything from the map?
6356 := We have to explore these worlds!
6357 := So now what?
6358 := What good is an incomplete map?
6359 := No, I do not need to see the vision again.
6360 := Yes, I want to see the vision again. 
6361 := They're waiting for you inside.
6362 := This morning's getting stranger by the minute. First Bastila comes out looking like she saw a ghost, and now you.
6363 := Well, Bastila did mention that you should go to the Council chambers before she left. It is no doubt urgent, so you shouldn't keep them waiting.
6364 := You got it.
6365 := Well, I can't say I blame you. I... I haven't exactly been sleeping well myself. Here I thought things would get better once we escaped Taris.
6366 := No, she didn't. She didn't seem well, as I recall... and for that matter neither do you. Are you alright?
6367 := Patrol droids - they may be programmed to attack on sight!
6368 := Dantooine looks peaceful enough, but packs of kath hounds roam these plains. We need to keep our guard up while we're out here.
6369 := Let's go.
6370 := I had a rough night...
6371 := Did she say anything else?
6372 := I'm fine, Let's go.
6373 := I had a rough night... Let's go.
6374 := Why are you bothering me? I am here to speak with the Council, not some servant! Please leave or I shall be forced to tell the Council of your rude behavior!
6375 := I demand justice! The Sandral family is a blight upon Dantooine! They must be punished!
6376 := The Council will look into this matter, Mr. Matale. You must be patient. Your accusations have no proof, and we do not want you stirring up trouble with the Sandrals if there is some mistake.
6377 := Mistake? My son Shen is missing! How can there be any doubt the Sandrals are to blame?
6378 := There are other possible explanations for your son's disappearance.
6379 := Bah! You Jedi are good for nothing but talk! I shall only wait so long before I take action on my own! 
6380 := As dangerous as the threat from Darth Malak and the Sith may be, we Jedi cannot simply abandon our other responsibilities. The Council has promised Alhan Matale we will look into his son's disappearance. 
6381 := Should you have time, Padawan, you may want to investigate this matter.
6382 := These two families have been settled here for some years now...
6383 := And causing me no end of trouble!
6384 := Indeed. They have been settled here for some time and feuding ever since.
6385 := Both families have settled to the south of this enclave. The Matales are the closer of the two.
6386 := Both have similar estates, but Ahlan is much more paranoid about his and guards it quite heavily.
6387 := Is there anything else you wish to know?
6388 := The Sandral and Matale families are involved.
6389 := The Sandrals live far to the south. The head of that family is Nurik Sandral. He is a stern man, but I believe him fair. Under the present circumstances, though... who knows?
6390 := Ahlan Matale can be much more unstable. He is convinced of his own importance and can be a most... oppressive individual at times. He lives closer to the enclave, but still to the south.
6391 := Is there anything else you wished to know?
6392 := I do not know how the original feud started, but they want nothing to do with each other.
6393 := As you may have heard, Ahlan Matale believes that his son, Shen, has been kidnapped by Nurik Sandral.
6394 := Curiously, Nurik's son Casus has been missing for some time as well... I fear Nurik may suspect Ahlan in this...
6395 := Is there anything else you wish to know?
6396 := Your study and training are important, of course. But the Jedi are not a cloistered Order. Our influence and teachings must spread beyond the walls of our Academies. 
6397 := It is in the real world that we truly prove ourselves worthy of the title Jedi. You would do well to remember this, young Padawan.
6398 := This task has its own importance. It may also serve to divert our minds for a short time... something which carries its own rewards.
6399 := Not to mention that I wouldn't mind getting out of this enclave for a bit. I mean, come on, how bad could it be?
6400 := If Shen Matale is not returned to his father it may ignite a savage and bloody feud between the Matale and Sandral estates. We must not allow that to happen.
6401 := Is there anything else I should know?
6402 := I must continue on my main mission.
6403 := I will investigate if there is time.
6404 := I shall investigate this immediately.
6405 := Where are they settled?
6406 := Which families are involved?
6407 := What caused this feud?
6408 := I have more important things to do!
6409 := But what about my Jedi training?
6410 := I shall look into it at once.
6411 := If you have questions, you should direct them towards the Jedi Council members.
6412 := Greetings, young Padawan. I trust your training goes well.
6413 := Master Zhar tells me you have successfully completed the tests, and I even see you have constructed your own lightsaber.
6414 := You should be proud of your accomplishment... but never forget that you still have much to learn.
6415 := As your power grows you will constantly face temptations to slip to the dark side. This is the eternal struggle of the Jedi.
6416 := Shen and Rahasia have been welcomed here in the compound for as long as they wish to stay. I am glad that your help enabled them to remain together.
6417 := A battle took place earlier to the south of the Enclave. A lot of people died and many droids were destroyed.
6418 := I wonder what dark force could have caused this to happen...
6419 := Greetings, apprentice... though I understand you shall not have that lowly title much longer. Master Zhar tells me your progress has been remarkable. 
6420 := Soon, he feels, you will attain the rank of Padawan. Then you will truly be a full-fledged Jedi. How are you enjoying your training?
6421 := There are caves on Dantooine that hold those rare crystals. But be warned, apprentice: They are dangerous. You should not meddle in things beyond you.
6422 := All Jedi must know the code. Its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order.
6423 := There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
6424 := Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice, if you ever wish to become a Padawan. 
6425 := You speak as if this were some foolish game! Have you no idea what is at stake?
6426 := With power comes responsibility, and only by learning discipline and sacrifice can we truly learn to master our potential. 
6427 :=  I wish you luck in your training, apprentice. There is much you must yet learn. May the Force be with you. 
6428 := Juhani was a... a dear companion to me for many years. We spent many nights together alone under the stars.
6429 := That will never happen again, thanks to you. Curse the Council for sending you, of all people, to speak to her! Could you have done nothing else?!
6430 := Why? Because the Council believed that my closeness to her might do more harm than good... and yet they send *you*, instead? And look what has happened. 
6431 := The Juhani I knew deserved more than this! She deserved more from the Council, and more from you!
6432 := You... you did not even try, did you? Did it even occur to you that Juhani might have been saved? That she might be worth saving?!
6433 := I should kill you for what you've done! And yet I can't, can I? I am a Jedi, and we are sworn to protect all... even the likes of you.
6434 := Get... get out of my sight! The very thought of the Council... and of you... makes me ill.
6435 := Pardon me if I find your apology rather disingenuous. Juhani meant nothing to you, and the Council should have known better than to entrust her life to you.
6436 := Do not presume to tell me how I should speak of anything! They should have known better than to entrust such a task to you!
6437 := She had it coming, did she? She had it coming?!
6438 := You have done a great thing. One of our own had strayed, but you have returned Juhani to the Order. For this you deserve the highest praise.
6439 := I wish you a pleasant stay here on Dantooine. May the Force be with you.
6440 := You there! Padawan! Why are you not wearing the customary robes of the Jedi? Do you mock the honored traditions of our Order?
6441 := Bastila? I have heard of her. They say she has already mastered the art of Battle Meditation, remarkable in one so young. Though I have heard she has a foolish pride in her own talents. 
6442 := But as for you... you claim you are not a Padawan? I find this hard to believe. The Force is strong within you. I can feel its presence. 
6443 := If this is some type of jest, it is in very poor taste. The Jedi Order is not a subject for jokes.
6444 := No, I suppose you did not. I apologize. 
6445 := Please forgive the abruptness with which I first greeted you. It was harsh, and perhaps unfair. My Master often warns me I must learn to control my emotions. I see I have much left to learn. 
6446 := My name is Belaya. I have come here to further my learning in the ways of the Force. Many Jedi come here to train under Master Zhar. 
6447 :=  Any who belong to the Order should surely know this. You must be neglecting your studies, Padawan.
6448 := I am looking to alter my lightsaber, and I heard about some caves.
6449 := I am still learning the Jedi Code.
6450 := I want to learn to use the Force, not listen to your philosophical babbling!
6451 := It's difficult, but worthwhile.
6452 := Why didn't you go to her, then?
6453 := I did my best. I'm sorry.
6454 := Should you be talking like that?
6455 := She had it coming, trust me.
6456 := Back off! I'm no Padawan! I'm <FullName>. I just came here with Bastila.
6457 := I believe you are mistaken. I am not a Padawan. I am <FullName>. I came here with Bastila. 
6458 := I didn't come here to be scolded by you! 
6459 := I am telling you the truth.
6460 := Are you a Jedi? 
6461 := I...
6462 := Aren't you just a sweet little droid, yes you are!
6463 := You didn't come here to listen to my ramblings on the evils of the Czerka Corp., I'll bet! What can I do for you?
6464 := Be sure to come back every now and again. I'm always getting more inventory in. You never know what I might have in stock, and my prices are always better than those crooks at Czerka Corp.!
6465 := They're vermin, mostly. Leftovers from the Mandalorian Wars. They lost their armies and worlds and now wander the galaxy raiding weak farms and outposts.
6466 := Any reasonably well-defended base could withstand them. This Enclave, for instance, would never fall to them.
6467 := They do make trouble for the farmers though... They're almost as much of a burden on ordinary people as that damn Czerka Corporation! But I digress...
6468 := They are the scum who could not stand defeat and fled the final battles. They do us no credit.
6469 := Don't get me started on Czerka Corp.!
6470 := They've got a monopoly on half the galaxy already, and they do everything they can to keep anyone else from getting a foothold in their territory: extortion, bribing officials and government diplomats.
6471 := Not to mention driving up prices on essentials like food and water on distant colonies. I've heard stories of them letting people starve to death because they couldn't afford their jacked-up prices!
6472 := And since they've thrown themselves in with the Sith, things have only gotten worse.
6473 := The Sith are tangled up in an expensive war with the Republic. They need supplies, equipment, resources.
6474 := There's lots of opportunities for a company with no morals, like Czerka Corp., to make some major profits. Malak has given them exclusive trading rights wherever the Sith have control.
6475 := It's bad enough they're helping to finance the Sith war effort, but I've heard rumors of even worse stuff.
6476 := Slaving, pillaging planets of their resources, genocide of indigenous species. The Sith and Czerka Corp. seem like a perfect match to me. Ah, listen to me going on...
6477 := Excellent. As always, my selection is somewhat limited. Czerka Corp. has a monopoly on some of the suppliers.
6478 := But I'm sure you'll find all my inventory is of the highest quality... and I've got a few special items you won't find anywhere else!
6479 := Welcome to my shop. It is always an honor to have a member of the Order grace my business with their, uh... business. As you know, I have nothing but the highest respect for the Jedi.
6480 := Manaan - the planet that supplies kolto - seems to have stopped exporting and aren't explaining why. I'm sorry to act like a Czerka Corp. guy, but I'll need to charge extra for it.
6481 := The Sith have been fighting amongst themselves on Korriban. Someone told me they have been killing each other in their temples. Sounds like the inside of a Czerka Corp. office to me!
6482 := The damn Czerka Corp. has been driven off one of their worlds! This is most excellent news, and to celebrate, I'm offering a discount - this time only!
6483 := There was some fighting down by the Sandral estate, I heard. I hope it's not the Mandalorian raiders acting up again...
6484 := Or maybe even some forces sponsored by Czerka Corp.! But maybe I'm just being a bit paranoid...
6485 := I understand congratulations are in order! You've decided to join the Jedi rank and file! Jedi <FullName>!
6486 := Another fresh-faced apprentice ready to leap into Jedi training with both feet. Well, best of luck to you is all I can say about that!
6487 := It's always good to see another ally in the fight against darkness and corruption.
6488 := If there were more people like you around, an honest businessman could make a decent living, and companies like that damn Czerka Corp. wouldn't even exist! But listen to me...
6489 := How goes the training? I hear the life of an apprentice can be pretty rough, but you should be proud of what you're doing!
6490 := Welcome to my shop, feel free to look around. Take a break from the trials of Jedi training. Speaking of which, I hear you've heard about the kinrath caves - the lightsaber crystal caves.
6491 := Sorry, my mistake. But if you were going, hypothetically speaking, I'd have a little proposal for you. Hypothetically, of course.
6492 := Those kinrath caves are crawling with crystals. Valuable crystals. Sure, the Jedi use them to make their lightsabers. But it's not like they need them all, right?
6493 := I'd pay very handsomely for any crystals that happened to end up in my eager hands.
6494 := Bring me those crystals here and I'll buy them from you, no questions asked. You might want to keep one for yourself, though. You'll need it for your lightsaber.
6495 := But enough of this. I'm sure there's another reason you came in to my shop. What can I do for you?
6496 := It's not like you have to tell the Jedi Council what you're doing. And it's not like anyone's going to miss a few extra crystals, right? Anyway, think about it.
6497 := I have my sources. Anyway, I've got a little proposal for you.
6498 := You must be the one I've been hearing about... the new recruit, as it were. <FullName>, I think they said.
6499 := Another fresh-faced apprentice ready to leap into Jedi training with both feet. Well, best of luck to you is all I can say about that!
6500 := Allow me to introduce myself. I am Crattis Yurkal, proprietor of the general store here on Dantooine. Not much to look at now, I'll admit, but I'm in on the ground floor! 
6501 := I mean, look at this planet - majestic fields, rolling plains, wide open terra firma. Elbow room - that's what people want.
6502 := Once word gets out, we'll have settlers and tourists from the galactic core just dying to come here.
6503 := And guess who'll be waiting for them? Not that blasted Czerka Corp., that's for sure! Not this time, no sir! This time it'll be Crattis Yurkal who makes the big bucks! But listen to me...
6504 := Greetings, my young friend. I assume you are not a member of the Order, as you are not wearing the traditional garb of the Jedi.
6505 := I think I'll be going now.
6506 := What have you heard about the Mandalorian raiders?
6507 := What do you have against the Czerka Corporation?
6508 := I think I'll be going now. 
6509 := Maybe we could discuss this some other time.
6510 := Do you mean Czerka Corp. are allied with the Sith? 
6511 := Worse? How has it gotten worse?
6512 := I'd like to see what you have for sale.
6513 := No, you must have me confused with someone else.
6514 := It's a deal!
6515 := Could I get in trouble for this?
6516 := I doubt the Order would approve of such a transaction.
6517 := How did you know that?
6518 := Greetings, young Padawan. Have you come seeking knowledge of the past? Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, or so they say.
6519 := As Chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, I find your quest for knowledge admirable. But I do not want to overwhelm you with the long history of the Jedi Order.
6520 := You should ponder the history of Revan; it contains many lessons you may need if we hope to defeat Malak and the Sith.
6521 := Your confidence is admirable, but you must guard against pride and arrogance. These lead to the dark side.
6522 := Revan's tale shows us how even the greatest of Jedi can fall to the dark side. You must always be on guard against the evil that dwells within you. Think hard upon this lesson.
6523 := May the Force be with you.
6524 := Greetings, young apprentice. Have you come seeking knowledge of the past? Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, or so they say.
6525 := I bid you welcome once more. I assume you have come so that I might continue my recounting of the recent history of the Jedi Order.
6526 := It pleases me to see a student who understands the value of history. I shall resume where we last left off.
6527 := I was telling you how Revan and Malak returned three years ago, at the head of a massive invasion fleet.
6528 := When we last spoke I had just told you of the Mandalorian invasion of seven years ago. The Republic sent their entire fleet to do battle with this new threat.
6529 := I have already told you of the war against Exar Kun and the damage it wrought upon the Republic and the Jedi Order. Even now we are still rebuilding from that terrible conflict.
6530 := Padawan, I must speak with you. You are now one of the Jedi, an Order with a long and glorious past... a past we should all be aware of. 
6531 := As a chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, I feel it is my duty to share the history of our Order with the newly initiated. Unfortunately, our recent history is one of tragedy and bloodshed.
6532 := The Mandalorian Wars, the fall of Revan and Malak, the rise of the Sith: there are important lessons to be learned from these events if we do not wish to repeat the mistakes of our past.
6533 := As you wish. I will not force you to hear what I have to say, though I think it is unwise to ignore the lessons of the past. Perhaps you can return when you have more time.
6534 := This facility is a training academy. The archives here are restricted to those who have attained the rank of Master. We must protect overeager Padawans from being exposed to dangerous knowledge.
6535 := The pursuit of knowledge is a noble goal, but there are some things that require the wisdom of a Master to truly understand. 
6536 := If you are seeking information on Revan, Malak and the Sith, I will gladly recount the recent history of our Order to you.
6537 := All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order. Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice:
6538 := There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
6539 := Knowledge of the code will lead you to the rank of Padawan, and knowledge of the Order and its history will guide you down the path of the light.
6540 := Of course I could not tell you the entire history of our Order; the Jedi have existed for thousands upon thousands of years. We are as old as the Republic itself.
6541 := Instead, I will begin forty years ago with the war of Exar Kun. Like Malak and Revan, Exar Kun was a Jedi who fell to the dark side and led an army against the Jedi and the Republic.
6542 := Exar Kun was defeated, but the war left both the Republic and our own Order severely weakened. For twenty years we struggled to rebuild, trying to erase the scars of the terrible conflict.
6543 := Twenty years ago the Mandalorians, aware the Republic was in a weakened state, began conquering small worlds on the Outer Rim. They were careful to choose only planets outside the Republic's jurisdiction.
6544 := After much debate, the Senate chose not to intervene. As long as the Mandalorians avoided planets that were members of the Republic itself, there would be no retaliation.
6545 := The Mandalorians stockpiled resources from their conquered worlds, preparing for a massive assault. Seven years ago they launched a simultaneous attack in three separate sectors of Republic space.
6546 := The Senate had no choice but to retaliate with the entire Republic fleet. The Mandalorian Wars had begun.
6547 := The Republic petitioned the Jedi Council for aid, but there were many factors to consider before we allowed ourselves to be drawn into another conflict so soon after the war with Exar Kun.
6548 := While the Jedi Council preached patience, there were many among our Order who were eager for us to join the battle. Two young Knights in particular demanded immediate action: Revan and Malak.
6549 := They rallied many of the Jedi to their cause and, against the wishes of their Masters, joined the Republic fleet battling the Mandalorians.
6550 := Revan was a brilliant military leader, and the Republic fleet began to win victory after victory. Four years ago the Mandalorians surrendered unconditionally.
6551 := Revan and Malak were heroes, the great saviors of the Republic. A third of the Republic fleet was under their direct command... and then something happened.
6552 := No one is denying that Revan was one of the keys to defeating the Mandalorians... but something happened out there on the Outer Rim.
6553 := Instead of returning after the war's end, the ships under Revan's command went deep into unexplored space. They claimed to be searching for the last remnants of the Mandalorian fleet.
6554 := All contact was lost. For many months it was assumed some great disaster had befallen the entire fleet. Everyone thought they were dead.
6555 := There were unsubstantiated rumors of Revan and Malak being seen on a number of different planets during these months - scattered sightings that were never confirmed.
6556 := Perhaps they simply went far beyond the edges of Republic space. Maybe they found previously undiscovered hyperspace routes to the ends of the galaxy. Nobody knows for certain.
6557 := Three years ago, Revan and Malak returned at the head of a massive invasion fleet. Revan had assumed the title of Sith Lord; the hero had become a conqueror.
6558 := Initially the bulk of the Sith force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan. With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers.
6559 := Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power. But what is more disturbing is the size of the Sith fleet itself.
6560 := Some of the ships in the Sith fleet are those that were under Revan's command during the Mandalorian Wars. But many more are of an alien design we have never seen before.
6561 := The source of this massive fleet is one of the many things about the Sith we cannot explain. It seems impossible to have created it in such a short time, yet we cannot deny its existence.
6562 := Some of the ships in the Sith fleet are those that were under Revan's command during the Mandalorian Wars. But many more are of an alien design we have never seen before.
6563 := The source of this massive fleet is one of the many things about the Sith we cannot explain. It seems impossible to have created it in such a short time, yet we cannot deny its existence.
6564 := The source of the Sith soldiers is, unfortunately, much easier to understand. Initially the bulk of the force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan.
6565 := With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers. Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power.
6566 := For two years the Sith were all but invincible. Fortunately, Bastila and her Battle Meditation allowed the Republic to win a few key victories and kept the Sith from total triumph.
6567 := In desperation we set a trap for the Dark Lord. Bastila was with the strike team that tried to capture Revan, as you probably know. She was there at Revan's end.
6568 := That was nearly a year ago, but things have not improved. Malak has stepped in and assumed the mantle of Dark Lord for himself, though he is far from Revan's equal in strategy or tactics.
6569 := Still, his fleet continues to grow in both ships and soldiers. If we do not find some way to stop the Sith soon, Malak will overwhelm us with sheer numbers.
6570 := Your confidence is admirable, but you must guard against pride and arrogance. These lead to the dark side.
6571 := Revan's tale shows us how even the greatest of Jedi can fall to the dark side. You must always be on guard against the evil that dwells within you. Think hard upon this lesson.
6572 := May the Force be with you.
6573 := Well, you can hardly blame the Republic. The memory of war was fresh in everyone's mind, nobody was eager to relive the horrors in a campaign against the Mandalorians. But in the end it was unavoidable.
6574 := All things in time. You shall learn that history is an intricate weaving of many events. No one thing can be understood without the proper context.
6575 := Ah, you have come, young apprentice, at Master Zhar's bidding. He sees great promise in you... as do I.
6576 := The time has come for you to choose the color of your lightsaber. This color also reflects your demeanor and position within the Order.
6577 := A Jedi is not restricted to a single color. Rather, that color is a badge of pride for the Jedi path it signifies. Should you have an appropriate crystal, you may change your blade to anything you desire.
6578 := But first you should learn of the different paths a Jedi may take.
6579 := Blue is the color of the Jedi Guardian. This Jedi battles against the forces of evil and the dark side. They focus more on combat training and use of the lightsaber.
6580 := Yellow is the color of the Jedi Sentinel. This Jedi ferrets out deceit and injustice, bringing it to light. They focus less on combat and more on other skills and abilities.
6581 := Green is the color of the Jedi Consular. This Jedi seeks to bring balance to the universe. They mediate between other groups, using their powers to end conflict and preserve peace.
6582 := Which color and path do you believe yourself most suited to, apprentice?
6583 := Indeed. We shall see. I will now ask you questions, and your responses will indicate which class you lean most towards.
6584 := A woman and her small child are beset by a desperate-looking group of thugs. They are menacing her with weapons and she screams to you for help. What do you do?
6585 := Hm... Indeed. Very well, on to the next question.
6586 := You are in combat with a Dark Jedi allied with the Sith. There is a pause in the combat. What do you do?
6587 := Yes, I suspected as much. Now for the next question.
6588 := There is a locked door and your goal lies on the other side. What do you do?
6589 := I am beginning to see a pattern here, apprentice. I have a feeling about what you would be best at. But first, the final question.
6590 := You are the head of an Enclave on a contested world. The Dark Jedi have infiltrated and are causing unrest across the planet. What do you do?
6591 := Yes, I thought as much.
6592 := As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Consular.
6593 := Here is a green crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.
6594 := As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Sentinel.
6595 := Here is a yellow crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.
6596 := As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Guardian.
6597 := Here is a blue crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.
6598 := I'll be going now.
6599 := Don't worry. I'll find a way to stop the Sith!
6600 := What am I supposed to learn from this?
6601 := I will think on this, Master Dorak.
6602 := Yes, continue the tale.
6603 := I don't have time for this right now.
6604 := Where are the Academy's archives?
6605 := I seek knowledge of the Jedi code.
6606 := Very well... tell me the history of the Jedi.
6607 := I am eager to learn, Master Dorak.
6608 := I don't have time for this right now.
6609 := What about the Mandalorian Wars?
6610 := But we ended up in a war anyway.
6611 := What about Malak and Revan?
6612 := Did the Jedi join in?
6613 := Where did the Sith come from?
6614 := How did Revan fall to the dark side?
6615 := So Revan did the right thing.
6616 := What happened next?
6617 := Where did they disappear to?
6618 := How did Revan get so many followers?
6619 := Where did Revan get the ships for the Sith fleet?
6620 := How can anyone hope to stop the Sith?
6621 := So what happened next?
6622 := I'll be going now.
6623 := Don't worry. I'll find a way to stop the Sith!
6624 := What can I learn from Revan's history?
6625 := I will think on this, Master Dorak.
6626 := They should have protected them!
6627 := That sounds like a big mistake.
6628 := What does this have to do with Revan and Malak?
6629 := Why do I get set with a single color?
6630 := What positions are there?
6631 := What colors are there?
6632 := Green. The path of the Jedi Consular.
6633 := Yellow. The path of the Jedi Sentinel.
6634 := Blue. The path of the Jedi Guardian.
6635 := Stop the thugs and find out why they are attacking her.
6636 := Attack the thugs.
6637 := Help them flee.
6638 := Try to see a weakness in his technique.
6639 := Find out why he turned to the dark side and try to turn him.
6640 := Attack him again.
6641 := Knock.
6642 := Try to pick the lock.
6643 := Coordinate with the planetary government to identify the infiltrators.
6644 := Try to lure them out into a trap.
6645 := Hunt them down.
6646 := Smash the door down.
6647 := I... I took the loss of my droid much too hard. I feel I must apologize.
6648 := Unfortunately I have none to give, otherwise I would. But I still feel I must explain myself... I suppose I came across as a little odd.
6649 := I was much too attached to my droid... It was all that was left of my husband, you see. Maybe I thought that through the droid, my husband could live again... be with me still...
6650 := But I must. I was much too attached to my droid... It was all that was left of my husband, you see. Maybe I thought that, through the droid, my husband could live again... be with me still...
6651 := But I went too far. I could not see what was missing in living a normal life. Fortunately, in my grief I returned here and ran into Samnt - an absolutely fascinating man!
6652 := Well, if his ego is similarly halved he should be just about right.
6653 := Samnt and I got to talking and, well, we have a lot in common. I think we'll be seeing more of each other. It's funny how these things work out in the end. Maybe there is such a thing as fate, after all...
6654 := But I think we should be going now... we have so much more to talk about! I just wanted to thank you for what you've done for me, and what you tried to do.
6655 := Goodbye, and thank you.
6656 := I think we understand. Love can do strange things to anyone.
6657 := Oh, thank you! Thank you!
6658 := I don't know what I would have done if I had lost him!
6659 := It's just so good to have him back!
6660 := We're just going to go right home right now and celebrate, aren't we, my lovely little droid?
6661 := Don't worry, I'm going to hug you and oil you and care for you and make sure you never get away ever again.
6662 := Please kill me...
6663 := Ha! I guess that droid is really going to to serve his master tonight!
6664 := [sadly] Beep Boop-oop.
6665 := I don't think I've ever felt so bad for a droid before.
6666 := I'll be waiting for you, Master Jedi.
6667 := A reward speaks louder than words.
6668 := Damn right!
6669 := There is no need.
6670 := Not half the man I am!
6671 := Meh, I've seen better.
6672 := He doesn't look that impressive.
6673 := Yes, he seems quite nice.
6674 := No...
6675 := I...
6676 := It's...
6677 := I agree. Completely.
6678 := The Council has decreed you must not leave the enclave. Please return to your room.
6679 := The Council has decreed you may come and go as you please.
6680 := Dantooine is one of our last refuges. The Sith hunt us everywhere.
6681 := If you are seeking information, perhaps the Jedi Council will help. I am afraid I cannot.
6682 := I hear that the Sith torture Jedi prisoners until they give in to the dark side. I hope that never happens to me!
6683 := I fear it is only a matter of time before the Sith find us here, too...
6684 := Enjoy the time you have here on Dantooine. I think the Council might decide to move to a different world soon.
6685 := Please, do not disturb me, I have pressing matters at hand.
6686 := I heard that the Sith have destroyed Taris. This bodes ill for us...
6687 := Good day to you. I am afraid I cannot speak to you at the moment. I apologize.
6688 := I do not know what the Council has in store for me, but I will trust in the Force and the way of the Jedi to help me through whatever is to come.
6689 := I must give you my thanks. Because of you, I am once again welcome within the Jedi Order.
6690 := Quatra's injuries were not so severe as I first believed. I was foolish to believe I could harm a Master such as she with my... my clumsy efforts.
6691 := The fierce confrontation between us was nothing more than a part of my training. Quatra wanted me to understand the threat of the dark side, to see how easy it was to fall from the path of light.
6692 := Quatra's methods may seem strange, but I trust her wisdom. This lesson has been difficult, but I am better because of it. Humility is never easy to teach, but now I truly understand my own limitations.
6693 := You can't expect everything to get handed to you on a silver platter.
6694 := After our last battle, Quatra had nothing left to teach me. I needed time alone to explore the turmoil of my own spirit. Only then was I ready to follow a guide - you - back to the light. 
6695 := When I left, Quatra knew her work with me was done. There are other disciples who need training throughout the galaxy, and she could not stay to see if I passed this most difficult trial.
6696 := With your help, I have passed this difficult trial. The Council now feels I am ready to continue with my training, though they have asked me to wait here for the time being.
6697 := I have spoken to the Council, and they have helped me see the truth. The truth about myself, and the truth of my actions.
6698 := I'm just glad I could help.
6699 := Did you learn anything more about Quatra?
6700 := The ways of the Jedi are strange indeed.
6701 := That's pretty harsh...
6702 := So where is Quatra now?
6703 := Have you spoken to the Council?
6704 := I greet you, Padawan. Members of the Jedi Order are always welcome in all the outposts of Aratech Droids. How may I serve you today?
6705 := I hear you have earned a name for yourself in racing speeders. I am sure that one such as you has many needs that I can hope to fulfill.
6706 := The Czerka Corp., the perennial rivals of my company, have suffered some major setbacks on the world of Kashyyyk, I hear.
6707 := Aratech will benefit greatly from this, I believe, and our benefit extends to our customers as well. Hopefully prices will fall in the near future. How may I be of assistance today?
6708 := I hear that there is much strife amongst the Sith as of late. It bodes well for the cause of the Jedi. How may I serve your needs today?
6709 := I greet you, apprentice Jedi. Master Zhar has informed me that your training is progressing most rapidly. I am honored to have such a promising pupil in my shop. How may I serve you?
6710 := I greet you, human. How may this outpost of Aratech Droids serve your needs?
6711 := I greet you, human. I am Karal Karr, owner of this outpost of Aratech Droids, Inc. 
6712 := My protocol droids are not programmed to interact with customers, so should you desire assistance I can aid you.
6713 := Please return again soon to Aratech Droids, Inc. for all your droid needs.
6714 := Only that they have been a nuisance to the farmers and settlers in the region.
6715 := They do not have the resources to penetrate this base, so I do not know of them first-hand.
6716 := Is there something else I can do for you?
6717 := Explore my inventory at your convenience. Settler families have purchased all my droids, but I have many upgrades and other wares for purchase.
6718 := I think I'll be going now. 
6719 := What do you know of the Mandalorian raiders?
6720 := Let me see what you have in stock.
6721 := Thank you again. I hope your mission for the Council goes well.
6722 := You're back. The Council said you might return to Dantooine... I'm glad you did. I wanted to thank you.
6723 := I almost didn't think the Jedi Council would give me a chance, but they said everyone was welcome to return to the light side.
6724 := I guess I never *really* believed in the dark side. This just feels so right. I can't remember the last time I felt at peace like this.
6725 := They said I have a long road ahead of me, but they made me a proper Padawan and I have a Master, now. I... I just can't thank you enough.
6726 := I'm glad you were there. I don't think I ever would have made it through the academy alive. And now I might actually become a Jedi someday.
6727 := Well, at any rate, I wish you well. May... may the Force be with you.
6728 := I guess so. You pointed me in the right direction, though, and I have to be grateful for that. The Sith certainly didn't have my best interest at heart.
6729 := I... guess, if that's how you want to look at it. The Sith don't support each other like the Jedi do... and I don't think that's a weakness at all.
6730 := You told me I should leave the Sith and seek out the Jedi. Well, I did. Everyone's been very nice... much nicer than I thought they would be.
6731 := Maybe you don't remember me? I'm Kel... Kel Algwinn. We, uh, met in the academy on Korriban.
6732 := You're certainly welcome.
6733 := I'm glad I could help.
6734 := The decision was yours, Kel.
6735 := You were too weak to be a Sith anyway.
6736 := Thank me for what?
6737 := Do I know you?
6738 := I am sorry, Padawan, I am unable to render assistance at this time.
6739 := I am sorry, apprentice, I am unable to render assistance at this time.
6740 := I am sorry, human, I am unable to render assistance at this time.
6741 := I am sorry we have nothing of value to give you as a reward. Our families have cut us off completely. Had the Council not taken us in, we would be foraging in the wilderness to survive. 
6742 := We are waiting before the ceremony. Hopefully, in time, our fathers will agree to attend. If not, we plan to have a small, simple ceremony. You will be invited, of course.
6743 := The Council will let us stay here as long as we want, though I know Shen and I are both hoping our fathers will forgive us and welcome us back into their homes. If not, we will try to build a future somewhere else. 
6744 := When I first met Shen, I feared our forbidden love was doomed to a tragic end. But thanks to you and the Jedi Council, our story ends in joy.
6745 := So... any wedding plans? 
6746 := What are your plans now?
6747 := I'm just glad I could help you out. 
6748 := What do YOU want?
6749 := Now, Samnt, don't be so rude. If it wasn't for this young Jedi, we wouldn't have met.
6750 := Rahasia and I cannot thank you enough for what you have done for us. Now we finally have a place to share our love, without fear of reprisals from our families. 
6751 := Not yet, my friend, but perhaps someday soon.
6752 := We will stay here for the next little while... We are still hoping our parents will learn to set aside their differences and welcome us back into their homes.
6753 := If they do not, perhaps we will travel to Coruscant or the Core Worlds and make our fortunes there.
6754 := Rahasia and I can spend the rest of our lives together... All thanks to you.
6755 := Good luck to you both. May you find the happiness you deserve.
6756 := I wish you the best of luck, Shen. I hope you two find the happiness I once knew myself.
6757 := So... any kids on the way yet? 
6758 := What are your plans now? 
6759 := I'm just glad I could help you out. 
6760 := Welcome back, young human. You are kind to spend time with a poor, old Hutt.
6761 := Welcome back, young apprentice. You are kind to spend time with a poor, old Hutt.
6762 := Welcome back, young Jedi. You are kind to spend time with a poor, old Hutt.
6763 := Greeting, young human. You are welcome in my humble abode, as are all others who deign to visit this poor, outcast Hutt.
6764 := Good luck to you then, in all your endeavors. Should you come back to me, I would be grateful for any conversation.
6765 := Hahaha! You are most perceptive, I see! Not many people can tell that at first glance.
6766 := But I know that is not what you meant. I labor under the misconceptions and biases against my species.
6767 := We have the unfortunate reputation, you see, of being criminals and murderers and worse...
6768 := But I am merely a businessman who has been cast out from his home in this most cruel war. Your Council has seen fit to grant me asylum here away from the dangers in this sector.
6769 := But enough about my troubles. What more would you have of me?
6770 := Alas, even a poor Hutt businessman is not exempt from the fires of the conflict that now rage between the Sith and the Republic.
6771 := The world my business was based on, Neka, was subject to a most unexpected and unfortunate attack by the Sith armada.
6772 := The space lanes were clear one day, then the next they were filled with Sith interceptors and closed to traffic.
6773 := I had under my employ - quite unwittingly, of course - certain transport pilots who knew ways to slip me past the blockade above that world.
6774 := That is the only means by which I managed to escape Neka before the Sith commander deemed it worthless and virus-bombed all intelligent life from it...
6775 := It gives one a new appreciation of the value of the... sometimes troubling Jedi Order.
6776 := Is there anything else you wish?
6777 := I am known as Shuma. I am one of the many who have been made poor and disadvantaged by this cruel, cruel war.
6778 := I must be going now.
6779 := You're a Hutt!
6780 := What are you doing here?
6781 := Who are you?
6782 := You must not fail in your mission, young Padawan. Find the Star Maps that lead to the Star Forge. This is the only way to stop Malak and his Sith followers.
6783 := You and Bastila are the galaxy's last, desperate hope. May the Force be with you in this quest.
6784 := You must not fail in your mission. Find the Star Maps that lead to the Star Forge. This is the only way to stop Malak and his Sith followers. You and Bastila are the galaxy's last, desperate hope. 
6785 := But beware the dark side. Bastila will guide you, but she herself is young and new to the ways of the Jedi. You must help her as much as she helps you.
6786 := The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, young Padawan. We pray you are up to the challenge.
6787 := May the Force be with you.
6788 := Padawan, you have done well in discovering the Star Map hidden within the ancient ruins. But there is more you must do in the battle against Malak and the Sith.
6789 := We Jedi know victory over the Sith will not come through martial might. The Council has a mission for you, Padawan.
6790 := I have consulted our vast archives in an effort to discover the nature of this 'Star Forge', but all my efforts have been in vain. 
6791 := Still, the Council are in agreement: the Star Forge must be found! Revan and Malak sought it out when they began their tragic fall; the Star Forge is surely a powerful tool of the dark side.
6792 := The Star Map in the ruins showed you four planets, but it was incomplete. It did not show the location of the Star Forge itself. We believe there may be similar Star Maps on other planets.
6793 := Each Star Map is likely a small piece of a larger puzzle. Find the Star Maps on Kashyyyk, Tatooine, Manaan and Korriban and we believe they will lead you to the Star Forge.
6794 := Ever brash, ever disrespectful! This is what we have pinned our hopes on?
6795 := Peace, Vrook. We have discussed this; there is no other choice.
6796 := The Jedi numbers have been ravaged by this war, by defections to Malak's cause and by Sith assassins. But we realize the importance of this mission.
6797 := Yet if we sent a company of Jedi Knights with you we would surely draw the full attention of Malak and the Sith, dooming your efforts to failure.
6798 := Secrecy is our best defense against the Sith, but it would be foolish to send you on this quest without someone to aid you, young Padawan.
6799 := Bastila will accompany you, for there is a powerful connection between you two... a connection that might be the key to unraveling the mysteries uncovered by Revan. 
6800 := Keep the example of Juhani fresh in your mind. You may need a reminder of the dangers of the path that leads to the dark side.
6801 := And Juhani has also asked to accompany you. After long deliberation we have granted her request.
6802 := Juhani nearly fell to the dark side. Perhaps her presence will serve as a reminder to you of the dangers of that path.
6803 := Of course those who aided you on Taris will also come; they possess skills you may find useful in your quest. Remember that secrecy and discretion are paramount to your success.
6804 := You will not be able to hide the fact that you are Jedi, nor should you. But the true nature of your mission must not reach Malak's ears.
6805 := You may return here at any time. Dantooine will be a sanctuary for you, a safe haven. Here you can find supplies and whatever advice or other aid we may give you. 
6806 := This was already explained to you. Your command of the Force makes you a threat to Malak. Eventually he will destroy you, and all the Jedi, unless you stop him first.
6807 := You can leave whenever you wish; the sooner the better. The longer you wait the stronger Malak becomes. But first a warning, young Padawan:
6808 := The lure of the dark side is difficult to resist. I fear this quest to find the Star Forge could lead you down an all too familiar path.
6809 := Your training is now complete, young Padawan. And perhaps now it is time we dealt with the matter of the dream you and Bastila shared.
6810 := When we heard of the ruins in your dreams, Master Dorak recognized it as one of a series of ancient structures here on Dantooine. This one in particular lies to the east of this Enclave.
6811 := We sent a Jedi to investigate... but he has not returned. Perhaps sending him in the first place was a mistake.
6812 := The Force is guiding you through your visions; it may be that exploring the ruins is a task tied to your destiny. That is why the Council has now decided you should be the one to investigate this.
6813 := The secrets to stopping Malak may be hidden within those ruins. You must investigate them and find what Revan and Malak were looking for.
6814 := That is most... unfortunate. She was always a model student and most eager to learn. I grieve that she had fallen to her passions.
6815 := Remember her example as well as that of Juhani: the dark side is not an enemy to be taken lightly.
6816 := We do not know. That is one of the things you must investigate. We... fear the worst.
6817 := Is there anything else you want to know?
6818 := Be sure to bring Bastila with you. There is a powerful link between you, and you will need to draw strength from each other during the trials ahead.
6819 := A Jedi must ever be seeking knowledge. What is it you wish to know?
6820 := We do not know. She was training here until your unfortunate incident with Juhani, then she simply disappeared...
6821 := We would like any word of her you may bring. I do not believe she has died, or fallen prey to beasts, but I worry that she may have done something rash.
6822 := She had always been close to Juhani, and her death may have hit Belaya... hard.
6823 := Is there anything else you wish to ask?
6824 := If Shen Matale is not returned to his father it may ignite a savage and bloody feud between the Matale and Sandral estates. We must not allow that to happen.
6825 := You should ask Master Vrook about that, Padawan. He is in charge of our relations with the settlers.
6826 := The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. You must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you. 
6827 := Master Vrook may seem harsh and critical, but he understands the dangers that lie in your path. He wants you and Bastila to be fully prepared when you finally face Lord Malak.
6828 := I knew Revan as a promising young pupil. Revan was strong in the Force, but also headstrong and proud. Such traits are not unusual in a Padawan. Perhaps that was why I did not see the true extent of the danger.
6829 := Many of the young Jedi admired Revan, including Malak. When Revan set off to challenge the Mandalorians, Malak was the first to join the cause.
6830 := And when Revan fell to the dark side it was inevitable Malak would fall as well.
6831 := Revan was always the more powerful of the pair. When Revan fell we had hoped the Sith threat was ended. But Malak quickly assumed Revan's role and embraced the dark side as fully as his Master ever had.
6832 := You should speak to Master Dorak after this council. As Chronicler of this Academy, he can give you more details of these events. But we must concern ourselves with the present.
6833 := Now Malak leads the Sith armada against the Republic, hate and vengeance drawing him ever further down the dark path, fueling his powers until they have surpassed those of his old Master.
6834 := Only you and Bastila together can stop Malak now.
6835 := Bastila will be a great Jedi someday. Even among the Masters and the Council it is rare to find one so skilled in the art of Battle Meditation. 
6836 := Bastila was there when Revan was slain. Did you know that?
6837 := Bastila herself does not like to talk about it. She was accompanying the strike team that confronted Revan when the Dark Lord was destroyed. Her role in the death of such a promising young Jedi as Revan upset her greatly. 
6838 := But Bastila knew she had to set her personal feelings aside for the sake of the galaxy and the Republic. The Force is strong with her now, and without her skill in Battle Meditation we would have lost this war long ago.
6839 := The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. But you must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you. 
6840 := Ah, you have returned, young Padawan. Have you discovered what it was that Revan and Malak sought in those ruins?
6841 := Lies! Bastila has already told us about this 'Star Forge' and the map you found!
6842 := Peace, Master Vrook. I'm certain the Padawan only meant they had not found anything beyond what Bastila would surely have told us.
6843 := This news of a Star Forge is disturbing. Action is required, but we must not do so in haste. We must discuss recent events in light of this new information. 
6844 := We should consult the Jedi archives to see if there is any mention of this 'Star Forge' and what it might do. We must learn why Revan and Malak sought it out.
6845 := Return to your ship with Bastila and we will summon you when we are done.
6846 := I have heard that the Sandrals and Matales have agreed to cooperation in the construction of a new estate to house their children. Apparently a son of one family and the daughter of the other are getting married.
6847 := I also I hear that we have you to thank for this happy occurrence. I am glad that you are using the authority our Order wields to achieve some measure of good.
6848 := Rahasia Sandral and Shen Matale have come here seeking shelter against their families. The Council has decided to give it to them.
6849 := Their love for each other was being denied by overly possessive parents and we learned that it was only by your intervention that they managed to escape here.
6850 := While it is regrettable that the fences between the families were not repaired, it is good that these two young lovers can live their lives free of oppression.
6851 := We have heard that there was a close confrontation between the Sandral and Matale families by one of the southern estates earlier. We also heard that it was by your actions that direct conflict was avoided.
6852 := It is good to hear that you have learned the lessons of the Jedi Order well enough to avoid conflict when necessary.
6853 := There has been a report of a terrible battle near the Sandral estate to the south of the Enclave. Apparently a large force of droids attacked the estate.
6854 := The defending droids returned in kind. The attacking family was apparently the Matale family launching an attack on the Sandral estate.
6855 := Both entire families were slain, including the boy Shen who had been reported missing.
6856 := There was a mention that someone noticed one or more other persons leaving the battle area after the conflict had finished. You were in that area, were you not? Did you see something?
6857 := [Success] Is that so... I cannot find fault with your statement, but something in your manner is odd. But no matter, more pressing things are at hand.
6858 := You must always remember the destruction and chaos that the dark side can reap, and avoid it at all costs.
6859 := Good evening, apprentice. I trust your training goes well?
6860 := Very well. May the Force be with you.
6861 := A Jedi must ever be seeking knowledge. What is it you wish to know?
6862 := The Mandalorians have not hurt anyone before now. We thought they would keep their activities down with our presence here.
6863 := But it seems we were tragically wrong...
6864 := You may deal with the Mandalorian raiders should you meet them. It might be good training to test your fighting skills this way.
6865 := These raiders are a disgrace. No true Mandalorian would stoop to raiding farms when whole worlds were open to them.
6866 := Master Vrook may seem harsh and critical, but he understands the dangers that lie in your path. He wants you and Bastila to be fully prepared when you finally face Lord Malak.
6867 := I knew Revan as a promising young pupil. Revan was strong in the Force, but also headstrong and proud. Such traits are not unusual in a Padawan. Perhaps that was why I did not see the true extent of the danger.
6868 := Many of the young Jedi admired Revan, including Malak. When Revan set off to challenge the Mandalorians, Malak was the first to join the cause.
6869 := And when Revan fell to the dark side it was inevitable Malak would fall as well.
6870 := Revan was always the leader, the more powerful of the pair. When Revan fell we had hoped the Sith threat was ended. But Malak quickly assumed Revan's role, and has embraced the dark side power as fully as his old master ever did.
6871 := Now Malak leads the Sith armada against the Republic. Hate and vengeance for his master's death draw Malak ever further down the path of the dark side, fueling his powers until they surpass those of his old master.
6872 := Only you and Bastila together can stop Malak now.
6873 := And they beat my people so easily in battle...
6874 := Bastila will be a great Jedi someday. Even among the Masters and the Council it is rare to find one so skilled in the art of Battle Meditation. 
6875 := Bastila was there when Revan was slain. Did you know that?
6876 := Bastila herself does not like to talk about it. She was accompanying the strike team that confronted Revan when the Dark Lord was destroyed. Her role in the death of such a promising young Jedi as Revan upset her greatly. 
6877 := But Bastila knew she had to set her personal feelings aside for the sake of the galaxy and the Republic. The Force is strong with her now, and without her skill in Battle Meditation we would have lost this war long ago. 
6878 := The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. But you must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you. 
6879 := Is there anything else you would like to know?
6880 := All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order. Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice:
6881 := There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
6882 := I have faith that you will achieve the rank of Padawan soon. Master Zhar is most impressed with your progress. May the Force be with you, apprentice.
6883 := Bastila has told us of your discovery in the ancient ruins. The Council has decided it would be best if you complete your apprenticeship before you embark on any further investigations in this matter.
6884 := As grave as the Sith threat may be, we cannot allow you to leave here until your apprenticeship is over. The danger of the dark side is too great to send you out unprepared.
6885 := Master Zhar feels you are ready to begin the final tests of your apprenticeship. Return to us when you have completed your training. 
6886 := It is most regrettable that Juhani could not be saved. We in the Council had high hopes for her in the future.
6887 := In every heart there is some means of redemption. Could you find none in Juhani?
6888 := [Success] Perhaps that was the case. It is most regrettable, indeed.
6889 := Perhaps that was the case. It is most regrettable, indeed.
6890 := Heed her example: all are susceptable to the lure of the dark side. We must always remain vigilant against it.
6891 := Go to Master Zhar and inform him that the grove has been cleansed. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.
6892 := It is good to see Juhani has returned to the way of the light. You are to be commended for your role in this. Your actions give us great hope for the future. 
6893 := Go to Master Zhar and inform him that Juhani has returned to us. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.
6894 := Bastila has told us of a most unusual development. She claims you and she have shared a dream, a vision of Malak and Revan in the ancient ruins here on Dantooine.
6895 := These ruins have long been known to us, but we believed them to be merely burial mounds. Perhaps they are more than we first suspected, if Revan and Malak found something there.
6896 := [Failure] See? Dishonesty! We are taking an incalculable risk in even considering training this one!
6897 := You cannot deny what you are. These dreams are part of you. The Force is part of you, though a part you cannot yet control. But through training and discipline we can teach you to live as one with the Force.
6898 := She says that she felt your presence within the dream, the presence she has felt within you ever since...
6899 := Master Vandar!
6900 := ... ever since Taris. It is not unknown for this to happen between two people strong in the Force.
6901 := Bastila has described this shared dream to the Council in great detail. We feel it is more than a dream. It is a vision. The Force is acting through you as it acts through Bastila.
6902 := You and Bastila share a powerful connection to the Force... and each other. This is not unheard of. Connections often form between Master and student, but rarely does a bond develop so quickly.
6903 := Whatever dangers may lie ahead, we cannot ignore the destiny that has brought you and Bastila here to us. Together. 
6904 := You and she are linked, as is your fate to hers. Together, you two may be able to stop Darth Malak and the Sith.
6905 := But do not let your head be filled with visions of glory and power! Such thoughts are the path to the dark side.
6906 := The way of the light is long and difficult, as you must learn. Are you ready for such hardship?
6907 := Good. It is well that you see how important this is and have the devotion to follow it.
6908 := Understand that there is little choice in this matter, for you or us. Across the galaxy the numbers of our Order dwindle. We have sent many Jedi in quest of a way to thwart Malak's advance... many have not returned.
6909 := The Sith hunt the Jedi down like animals, ambushing and assassinating our brothers wherever they are found. We fear it is only a matter of time until they discover even this hidden refuge.
6910 := Other Jedi have fallen from the light and embraced the dark side, giving their allegiance to the Sith and Malak, their dark lord. 
6911 := Perhaps our hope lies in the dream you and Bastila shared. The Council has come to the conclusion that you and Bastila must investigate the ancient ruins you dreamed of.
6912 := [Success] If Malak is not stopped the Republic will fall, and the Jedi will be hunted to extinction. The galaxy will enter a time of darkness and tyranny not seen for a thousand generations. 
6913 := The lure of the dark side is not easy to resist. Malak's power grows as more and more planets fall to his conquering armies.
6914 := If Malak is not stopped the Republic will fall, and the Jedi will be hunted to extinction. The galaxy will enter a time of darkness and tyranny not seen for a thousand generations. 
6915 := The Council has decreed that you and Bastila must investigate the ancient ruins you dreamed of... once the Council deems you ready.
6916 := Perhaps there you will find some clue, some explanation, of how Revan and Malak were corrupted. And perhaps there you shall find a way to stop them.
6917 := [Success] Hm, yes. Your devotion is most commendable.
6918 := You have a strong affinity with the Force. With such power comes great responsibility... and danger. You may wish to deny what you are, but the Council cannot turn a blind eye. 
6919 := Neither will Darth Malak. Your strength is a threat to him. In time he will learn of you and the Sith will hunt you down. It is inevitable. Defeating the Sith is the only way to save yourself.
6920 := The Force flows through you like no student we have ever seen. But you are willful and headstrong... a dangerous combination.
6921 := Before we send you to investigate the ruins, you must be trained in the ways of the Jedi so that you can resist the darkness within yourself... within all of us. Otherwise you are doomed to fail.
6922 := [Success] We must begin your training at once. You have a destiny upon you that you must be prepared to face. The entire fate of the galaxy is upon you.
6923 := We must begin your training at once. You have a destiny upon you that you must be prepared to face. The entire fate of the galaxy is upon you.
6924 := I can only hope you will prove up to the task. 
6925 := You must learn patience and discipline. The ruins are a place of corruption. The dark side is strong there. We cannot risk sending you there unprepared.
6926 := Sounds like a suicide mission to me.
6927 := I am ready to do the Council's will.
6928 := Good. Others will only slow me down.
6929 := Am I to undertake this task alone?
6930 := Great... Bastila again. Anyone else you want to stick me with?
6931 := Great... Bastila and the cat woman. Anyone else you want to stick me with?
6932 := There are others I want to join me.
6933 := Why should I risk my life to stop Malak?
6934 := When do I leave?
6935 := You can count on me. I will not fail.
6936 := I have found and slain Belaya. She had turned to the dark side.
6937 := What happened to the Jedi who went to investigate?
6938 := I will investigate the ruins right away.
6939 := I'd like to ask you some questions. 
6940 := What happened to Belaya?
6941 := What should be done about the Sandral and Matale families?
6942 := Why doesn't Master Vrook like me?
6943 := Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?
6944 := I think I'll be going now. 
6945 := Are you saying Revan was responsible for Malak's fall? 
6946 := So Revan was stronger than Malak? 
6947 := What can you tell me about Bastila?
6948 := I think I'll be going now. 
6949 := Carth mentioned something about it.
6950 := I had no idea. 
6951 := [Lie] No, I could not find anything.
6952 := We found an incomplete Star Map and mention of something called a Star Forge.
6953 := [Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.
6954 := [Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!
6955 := [Lie] No, I was somewhere else.
6956 := I must be going now.
6957 := I'd like to ask you some questions. 
6958 := Why does the Council do nothing about the Mandalorian raiders?
6959 := Master Vrook doesn't seem to like me very much...
6960 := Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?
6961 := I think I'll be going now. 
6962 := Are you saying Revan was responsible for Malak's fall? 
6963 := So Revan was stronger than Malak? 
6964 := What can you tell me about Bastila?
6965 := I think I'll be going now. 
6966 := Carth mentioned something about it. 
6967 := I had no idea. 
6968 := I seek knowledge of the Jedi Code.
6969 := My training is progressing quite well.
6970 := [Lie] She was too evil to ever come back.
6971 := [Lie] She attacked without speaking.
6972 := I couldn't see a way to save her.
6973 := [Lie] I don't know what Bastila is talking about.
6974 := What?? How would Bastila know if we shared a dream?
6975 := I don't want to talk about it.
6976 := Yes... they seemed to be searching for something
6977 := I trust in your greater wisdom.
6978 := I am having visions now?
6979 := What are you talking about?
6980 := Are you saying I'm... joined with her?
6981 := [Lie] Of course, Masters. I seek to follow the light.
6982 := I will try my best.
6983 := Yes. I'm ready for whatever awaits me. 
6984 := How can he be stopped?
6985 := [Lie] Do not fear Masters, I will not fall.
6986 := Jedi are turning to the dark side?
6987 := [Lie] Of course, Masters. Anything to further the light.
6988 := I don't know if I want to do this... it sounds dangerous.
6989 := I will learn your Jedi powers and defeat Malak!
6990 := It seems I have no choice...
6991 := Very well, I will help you.
6992 := I'm ready now. I accept this mission.
6993 := [Lie] I surrender myself to the will of the Council.
6994 := As you wish, Master Vandar.
6995 := We don't have time for this!
6996 := For good or ill, you are now a true Padawan. The time has come for you and Bastila to investigate the dream you shared. The secrets to stopping Malak may lie hidden within the ancient Dantooine ruins you both saw in your visions.
6997 := As you strive to defeat our enemy, you must always guard against the enemy within yourself.
6998 := The easy lure of the dark side is difficult to resist, and I fear this quest to find this mysterious Star Forge will lead you down an all too familiar path.
6999 := The Council has placed the fate of the galaxy within your hands. I pray both you and Bastila are able to emerge from this ordeal as servants of the light. May the Force be with you, young Padawan.
7000 := It is well that you are still alive, Padawan, in that you have not yet managed to fail us completely. Why is it that you are now bothering me instead of seeking out the Star Map?
7001 := You have a mission to attend to, Padawan. And as much as I may wish it otherwise, you are our only hope.
7002 := I find that... disturbing. It is our failings as teachers that enabled this to happen.
7003 := Do not give in to the same dark urges as she did or you may suffer a similar fate.
7004 := The Jedi Belaya would seem to have disappeared. She had a lesson scheduled with Master Zhar but did not show up.
7005 := I have heard someone say that she had been seen leaving the Enclave, but I do not know where she would have gone.
7006 := If you meet her, you may want to ask her why she left. We do not force anyone to stay here, so do not think to take that route.
7007 := Is there anything else, then?
7008 := Ah, Nemo. He was a brave and honorable man. He had great strength with the Force.
7009 := I would not have thought that kath hounds alone would be able to overcome him. Perhaps there was more...
7010 := But remember your task, Padawan!
7011 := The Sandrals and Matales have been at odds ever since they came to this planet. And have been making my life difficult the entire time, as well.
7012 := Now Ahlan Matale accuses Nurik Sandral of stealing his son, Shen. Nurik Sandral's own son Casus has been missing for a while now. We do not know what has happened.
7013 := Ahlan is rash enough, and stupid enough, to start a war over any imagined slight. We would resolve this, but we have too few Jedi to spare. It must be resolved peacefully!
7014 := Their estates are both located to the south of the Enclave - the Sandral fairly far. It would normally be your duty to assist in such matters, but your primary task takes precedence.
7015 := If you are stuck on the planet for a while you may investigate. I would recommend starting at the estate of Ahlan Matale.
7016 := Shen and Rahasia have been granted asylum here at the Enclave until they can find a way to deal with their families. I hear you had something to do with that.
7017 := It is the way of the Jedi to provide help to those in need, and you seem to have lived up to this duty. I congratulate you, Padawan.
7018 := There was a battle near one of the southern estate recently. Many people were killed. Do you know anything about it?
7019 := [Success] Hmph. Indeed. I cannot prove anything, but I have my suspicions. I will keep my eye on you, Padawan.
7020 := I see you insist on wandering the halls of our Enclave when you should be busy studying your lessons. 
7021 := Hmph! Well, get along then! Maybe you'll find the time to do something useful.
7022 := I suppose such desires are inevitable, though I fear you may seek knowledge for which you are not prepared. Yet I will do my best to guide your quest.
7023 := So you heard about them, did you?
7024 := They have been harmless up until now. It is tragic that someone had to die before we took action.
7025 := You have our leave to deal with the murdering Mandalorian raiders should you encounter them.
7026 := If you find me overly critical, perhaps it is because you do not fully understand what is at stake. For fifteen thousand years the Republic has brought peace and stability to the galaxy. 
7027 := Now the Republic may be destroyed because we, the Jedi, have failed them. Revan and Malak were paragons of the ideals the Order seeks to uphold, yet they succumbed to the temptations of the dark side.
7028 := When Revan fell, Malak took up the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith. Should Malak be stopped, what is to stop another Jedi from taking his place? This is the burden we Masters must carry.
7029 := Only through strict training and relentless lessons can we prevent the Dark Master from being reborn.
7030 := That is why the Order can brook no failure in our apprentices and pupils. That is why I can accept nothing but perfection from you.
7031 := Revan was once a promosing Padawan. But ever eager to learn more about the Force, Revan sought knowledge of ancient Sith magics, foolishly ignoring the dangerous lure of the dark side.
7032 := When the Mandalorian invasion came, Revan seized the opportunity it presented. Many Jedi flocked to the Outer Rim to follow the charismatic young Knight... and many fell under the sway of the dark side.
7033 := I do not believe Revan and Malak were corrupted on the Outer Rim. They had begun their journey down the dark path long before the Mandalorian threat appeared. 
7034 := Here on Dantooine they discovered a sinister cave, a place where the strength of the dark side overwhelms the light.
7035 := Perhaps this discovery was what first corrupted them... or perhaps they sought the cave out because they were already corrupted.
7036 := Whatever the explanation, the Order was unable to turn them back to the light. Had the Council taken more decisive action in this matter, perhaps Revan and Malak could have been stopped. But in this we failed.
7037 := The Jedi Revan was a great warrior and a amazing general. Even Mandalore himself couldn't defeat him.
7038 := Bastila? The young Jedi holds great promise... and great danger. She can do much for both the Republic and the Council. Without her skill in Battle Meditation the Sith armada would have conquered the galaxy long ago.
7039 := But despite her command of the Force Bastila is still young. She is a Jedi, but she has not attained the rank of Master. The Council would do well to remember this before we lay the fate of the galaxy on her slender shoulders.
7040 := You would do well to focus more closely on your lessons. The Force is strong with you, but you need training and guidance in the ways of the Jedi, lest you suffer a fate similar to that of Revan. 
7041 := You do not know the Jedi Code? Without knowledge of those doctrines all your training will be for naught! All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order!
7042 := There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
7043 := Learn these truths, apprentice... or we shall all regret the decision to accept you into the Order.
7044 := It appears that soon you will achieve the rank of Padawan. Master Zhar is most impressed with your progress. But I cannot help but wonder if you move forward too quickly.
7045 := I have heard what you have done, and how Juhani has been slain. I had hoped that this would not have to come to pass.
7046 := Could you find nothing in Juhani that could be redeemed?
7047 := [Success] I am skeptical of your methods and your intentions. But if nothing could be done, then that is the way of things.
7048 := I am skeptical of your methods and your intentions. But if nothing could be done, then that is the way of things.
7049 := Keep in mind the danger of the dark side, lest you fall into its grasp.
7050 := I must congratulate you on your actions. You have saved Juhani and brought her back into the Order, and have given us all great hope for your future success. May the Force be with you as you continue your training.
7051 := I am sorry, Master Vrook. I will go.
7052 := I have slain Belaya on Korriban. She was a Dark Jedi.
7053 := What happened to Belaya?
7054 := I have found the body of the Jedi Nemo. He was slain by kath hounds.
7055 := What can you tell me about the Sandral and Matale feud?
7056 := [Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.
7057 := [Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!
7058 := [Lie] No, I was somewhere else.
7059 := I must be going now.
7060 := I would like to ask some questions. 
7061 := Why does the Council not stop the Mandalorian raiders?
7062 := Why are you always criticizing me? 
7063 := You often seem angry with me, Master Vrook. Have I displeased you?
7064 := Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak? 
7065 := I should be going now.
7066 := What happened on the Outer Rim to corrupt Revan? 
7067 := What can you tell me about Bastila?
7068 := I seek knowledge of the Jedi Code. 
7069 := My training is going well. 
7070 := [Lie] She was too far gone to the dark side.
7071 := [Lie] She didn't give me a chance.
7072 := I could not see a way to save her.
7073 := Good luck, my friend. May the Force be with you.
7074 := Hello. It is... good to see you again.
7075 := You are the one who suggested I rethink my path. And I have... and you were right.
7076 := It's been very hard to let go of all those thoughts... about power and strength and victory. I don't know if I'll ever be completely free of them.
7077 := The real irony is that, despite what the Sith Code says, I've never felt more free. I think I might... be able to find a little peace here. Finally.
7078 := That's... very tempting.
7079 := But I'm not ready to leave here, yet. And I don't belong on the path you have to take... I told you that on Korriban. It's still true.
7080 := But... perhaps you could come back, afterwards. I could certainly use a friend, then.
7081 := Oh. Well, that's too bad. I'm still grateful for what you've done for me, regardless.
7082 := I know. I can... see that about you. I'm not sure that we will meet again. Still... I can hope that is the case.
7083 := That's good. I look forward to that time. Perhaps we can travel together, then.
7084 := You know, I'd forgotten all about that until I spoke to you about it on Korriban. Strange, considering my hate for them is what made me leave the Jedi.
7085 := I think... I think I've got to help myself, first, before I can help anyone else.
7086 := Maybe once that happens, I can work with the Jedi to make a difference. They may work slowly, but they do make a difference, don't they?
7087 := You believe that? I believe that they're better than the Sith. The Sith bring more misery than the slavers ever did. I don't know why I didn't see that before.
7088 := I may not be able to change everything at once like I wanted to... but it would feel good to really help someone, for a change.
7089 := Maybe that's a reason to change. Maybe that's a reason to stay. I... I guess I'll see.
7090 := More than the Sith did. The Sith bring more misery than the slavers ever did... I don't know why I didn't see that before.
7091 := I don't know. I doubt it. Even if I wanted to, the Sith would never take me back. To them, I am a traitor.
7092 := But the dark side... that's a different matter. The dark side is not the Sith. I still feel its temptation strongly.
7093 := My emotions are so strong. Just the other day I nearly attacked a poor Padawan for tripping into me, nearly berated his clumsiness and weakness.
7094 := I didn't, thankfully, but it's difficult to fight off those feelings. How do you do it?
7095 := You jest, but I think I know how you really feel.
7096 := The one thing that made me come here was how hard I had to think to remember where I began and where Yuthura the Sith Master ended.
7097 := That wasn't the person I wanted to be, so how did I end up there? It... it will take some time for me to sort through that, I think.
7098 := That's the worst thing to hear... how hard it is. I suppose that's the honest answer. The dark side is the easier path for a reason.
7099 := And to think I took my advice to come here from you. Ha ha! Perhaps you should follow your own counsel sometime.
7100 := For now. They've been very welcoming... more than I expected. I met my old master. He... he cried when he saw me.
7101 := I was embarrassed to see his weakness. Old habits die hard. But... it felt good, too. It felt good to know he missed me, that he worried about me.
7102 := The Council said they would give me time to decide if I wanted to try again, if I was ready. I don't know. There's... there's so much that I've done.
7103 := It's not that easy for me. There's an... an ache inside me I just can't seem to quench.
7104 := My old master said he would start exercises with me again... slowly, when I was ready. He said my experience with the dark side could make me a very wise Jedi.
7105 := There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
7106 := Those words never held such resonance for me until I returned. I'd... like some serenity, some harmony. Wouldn't you?
7107 := That's too bad. A little serenity might be useful considering the fate you have in store for you.
7108 := Yes, I suppose your fate still has much in store for you, just as I saw back on Korriban.
7109 := Then may the Force be with you, my friend. I hope we will see each other again.
7110 := I suppose I owe it to you, and to myself, to give the Jedi another chance. I'm not the foolish young girl I once was.
7111 := I suppose I have. It's still tempting, all that power... but I've had my fill of it and it wasn't enough.
7112 := Yes. Part of me just wants to forget it, to put it behind me... but that isn't right, either. I have to accept it and move on.
7113 := I did. You told me I should rethink my path, and I did. You were right.
7114 := What? What are you doing here?
7115 := Why don't you come with me? I could use you at my side.
7116 := We're not friends.
7117 := I don't know. I might not be coming back.
7118 := I'd be glad to be your friend, Yuthura.
7119 := What about all the slavers you wanted to fight?
7120 := Not really.
7121 := Maybe a little.
7122 := I think they do.
7123 := Do you think you might ever go back to the Sith?
7124 := I'm just a natural, I guess.
7125 := It's not easy.
7126 := I try. I'm not always successful.
7127 := I don't. I do what I like.
7128 := So the Jedi Council will let you stay?
7129 := I wouldn't worry about it so much.
7130 := That's not really my style.
7131 := If I had a choice, yes.
7132 := I've got to go.
7133 := I think you should at least try.
7134 := You've seen what the dark side can do.
7135 := You've got a lot to atone for, I suppose.
7136 := Yuthura! So you made it here after all.
7137 := May the Force be with you in your quest.
7138 := Shen Matale and Rahasia Sandral have fled their feuding families and asked for sanctuary here in the Enclave. The Council has granted this request.
7139 := I have heard that it was by your actions that they managed to escape, and I must congratulate you for avoiding a potentially dangerous situation.
7140 := I have heard there was some sort of large battle to the south of here between two families of settlers.
7141 := Apparently both the families were completely killed in the fight, along with their respective droids.
7142 := I find that most suspicious. Were you not in that area recently?
7143 := [Success] Perhaps, perhaps. That or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.
7144 := [Success] Hm, is that so... It is tragic that this had to happen to those families. Their children were in love, I hear.
7145 := Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders, or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.
7146 := Let this be a lesson against hate and violence: a Jedi must always be wary lest these lead to the dark side.
7147 := I have nothing left to teach you, Padawan, though a Jedi is ever learning. Even the Masters know their training is but in its infancy. Now is the time for you to seek wisdom outside the training chambers. 
7148 := The lessons that yet await you are to be found beyond the walls of this academy. You should speak to the Council, Padawan.
7149 := Now that the first stage of your training is complete I am certain they would be eager to have you aid us in our struggle against Darth Malak and the Sith.
7150 := You have cleansed the grove of its dark taint, but at great cost. Juhani was a most promising student and could one day have been strong in the Force.
7151 := Do not dismiss what happened to her, however. Juhani was both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the lure of the dark side.
7152 := Keep this in mind always in the future, and do not forsake the path of the light.
7153 := You have done well, my pupil. The ancient grove has been purified, and Juhani's journey down the dark path has been halted. Because of you she walks once more in the light. 
7154 := But though she was saved, do not dismiss what happened to her. Juhani is both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the dark side. As are we all.
7155 := She struck her master in anger during training, and injured her greatly. But it was Quatra's choice to test Juhani this way, and it seems to have made its point.
7156 := Juhani has been redeemed, and you have passed your final test.
7157 := Congratulations, apprentice. Or should I say congratulations, Padawan? You have proven yourself worthy of joining the Jedi. Let me be the first to welcome you as a full-fledged member of our Order!
7158 := The dark side still taints the ancient grove. Your lessons cannot continue until the spreading corruption of the dark side has been stopped. This is your task, apprentice. May the Force be with you.
7159 := Greetings, my young pupil. Your progress has been most remarkable so far. Are you here to continue your training in the ways of the Jedi?
7160 := Few mention those names around here anymore... but I suppose it is just as dangerous to deny they were ever part of the Order.
7161 := When I was still on Coruscant Revan and Malak often came to me for additional training. In particular, Revan's hunger to learn seemed insatiable. I should have recognized this as a warning sign. 
7162 := But I perceived the young Padawan's lust for knowledge as simple exuberance and eagerness. Revan was my most promising pupil, one I felt sure would someday become a champion of the Jedi Order.
7163 := The Jedi Order moved too slowly for Revan and Malak; we were too cautious in their eyes. They always sought to learn far quicker than their Masters felt was prudent.
7164 := It is one thing to understand a lesson, but to truly comprehend it takes a wisdom that only comes with time.
7165 := Several years ago, when the Mandalorian threat first arose, Revan and Malak were eager to journey to the Outer Rim to defeat the enemy of the Republic.
7166 := But the Council felt it best if we moved with care and caution. The true threat, the Council feared, had not yet revealed itself.
7167 := But Revan would not be dissuaded. Charismatic and powerful, it was inevitable many of the Order would flock to Revan's seemingly noble cause.
7168 := Malak was the first to join his closest friend. Others soon followed, many of our youngest and brightest, intent on saving the galaxy from the Mandalorian threat.
7169 := They were foolish to disregard the Council's wishes. I do not know what happened to Revan, Malak and their followers on the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim, but something corrupted them.
7170 := Their ideals became twisted, their spirits were tainted and they fell to the dark side.
7171 := There is a lesson in this, a lesson you would do well to take to heart: the dark side can corrupt even the most noble of Jedi.
7172 := You have learned much, yet there is much more for you to still understand. The way of the Jedi must be entered into with a clear and focused mind. 
7173 := When you feel you are ready to continue your training, know that you can find me here.
7174 := For every Jedi the threat of the dark side is always present. You must truly understand this before you are accepted into the Order. You must see the corruption of the dark side for yourself.
7175 := Even here on Dantooine there are places where the dark side holds sway, twisting and tainting nature itself.
7176 := The ancient grove once used for deep meditation by the Jedi is now tainted, a wave of darkness perverts the region around it.
7177 := The kath hounds in the area have become savage and ruthless. They have become a threat to the settlers, a threat the Jedi have promised to stop.
7178 := The kath hounds are but a symptom of the true problem. You must journey into the grove and confront the true source of the darkness. That is your task.
7179 := I can say no more; some things you must see for yourself. None of the other Jedi at the academy are permitted to help you in this task.
7180 := But remember this, my young apprentice: a Jedi acts with patience and care, and those on the dark path are not always lost forever.
7181 := Soon your apprenticeship will end and you will be granted the title of Padawan, the lowest rank of those within the Jedi Order. Yet first you must prove yourself worthy.
7182 := In the traditions and customs of our Order, as handed down from Master to pupil for a thousand generations, you must successfully complete three tests before you earn your place among the Jedi.
7183 := These tests will see if you have truly mastered the training you have been given, both mental and physical. Upon completing these tests you will pass from apprentice to Padawan, and join in the ranks of the Jedi.
7184 := First I will test your knowledge of the Jedi Code. These tenets must always guide your actions, in everything you do you must always be conscious of their wisdom. 
7185 := You must now prove you have a Jedi's understanding of the Code by completing these fundamental precepts of our Order:
7186 := There is no emotion...
7187 := That is not correct, apprentice. Perhaps you are not yet ready for this challenge.
7188 := There is no shame in admitting weakness. Feel free to speak to the other Jedi in the academy if you require assistance. They will gladly share their knowledge with you.
7189 := Return when you feel you are ready for this challenge. May the Force be with you.
7190 := There is no ignorance...
7191 := There is no passion...
7192 := There is no chaos...
7193 := There is no death...
7194 := You have learned your studies well, apprentice. It will not be long before you are a full member of our Order.
7195 := But first you must pass the second test, and learn about the most prized possession of a Jedi, the very symbol of our Order: the lightsaber.
7196 := The lightsaber is the traditional weapon of our Order. It is a symbol of a Jedi's skill, dedication and authority, and each lightsaber is as individual as the Jedi who wields it.
7197 := The blade is made of pure energy, focused by polished crystals in the hilt. As the second test, each Jedi must construct his lightsaber with his own hands.
7198 := And now it is your time. Speak with Master Dorak and he will guide you through the choosing of a crystal.
7199 := The blade is made of pure energy, focused by polished crystals in the hilt. As the second test, each Jedi must construct her lightsaber with her own hands.
7200 := You have done extremely well in constructing your lightsaber, apprentice. Your crystal seems to have been set perfectly. It is rare indeed for that to happen the first time one constructs their lightsaber.
7201 := These crystals are very rare, found only in certain caves strong in the Force. By adding crystals to your lightsaber you can alter or enhance its properties.
7202 := There have even been unconfirmed rumors of certain Force-sensitive caves here on Dantooine that may hold these crystals.
7203 := Your lightsaber identifies you as a member of the Jedi Order. With such recognition comes honor and respect... and the attention of dangerous enemies.
7204 := The Sith and Dark Jedi will seek to destroy you, apprentice. And you must prove yourself worthy in battle against a foe who also wields a lightsaber.
7205 := Are you ready to face the final challenge, apprentice?
7206 := They can modify simple things, such as the color of your blade, or complex ones, such as crystals that reputedly increase the strength of the beam.
7207 := But you must learn first to use your lightsaber and take care when drawing it.
7208 := It is a rumor only. I do not know if there is any truth in it.
7209 := Ah, so you are the one who rescued Bastila. It is appropriate you are here. We have been discussing your rather special case. I am Zhar, a member of the Jedi Council.
7210 := With me are Master Vrook, Master Vandar and, of course, the Chronicler of our Academy, Master Dorak. Padawan Bastila I am sure you are already familiar with.
7211 := Indeed, I am sure that you do. I assure you that we will have answers for you.
7212 := Darth Malak seeks to destroy the Jedi Order. Our most effective weapon, perhaps our only hope, is Bastila's skill with Battle Meditation.
7213 := With this power she can swing the tide of nearly any battle in our favor. Which is why Malak was seeking her so fervently.
7214 := And if he could not have her, he would see her destroyed. Taris was just in the way.
7215 := We need Bastila in our fight against the Sith. Indeed, we need every Jedi we can muster, since the Sith have been hunting us down at every opportunity.
7216 := Which brings us to you...
7217 := Yes, the High Council of the Jedi Order is on Coruscant, but we are the Council in charge of the training facility here on Dantooine.
7218 := This is no trap. The Council just wants to talk to you. There is much that needs to be discussed.
7219 := Bastila tells us you are strong in the Force. We are considering you for Jedi training.
7220 := Master Zhar speaks out of turn, perhaps. We need indisputable proof of your strong affinity to the Force before we would even consider accepting you for training.
7221 := Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this woman... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...
7222 := Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this man... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...
7223 := Perhaps it was simple luck.
7224 := We both know there is no luck. There is only the Force. We all feel the power in Bastila's companion, though it is wild and untamed. Now that this power has begun to manifest itself, can we safely ignore it?
7225 := The Jedi training is long and difficult, even when working with a young and open mind. Teaching a child is hard. How much harder will it be for an adult to learn the ways of the Jedi?
7226 := [Success] Traditionally the Jedi do not accept adults for training, though there are rare exceptions in the history of our Order. But you are a special case.
7227 := Such pride! Such arrogance! Ach. This one is already on the path to the dark side!
7228 := As are many who are not given proper training, Master Vrook. Only through our guidance can we hope to lead those who have strayed back to the path of the light. 
7229 := Traditionally the Jedi do not accept adults for training, though there are rare exceptions in the history of our Order. But you are a special case.
7230 := I agree with Master Dorak. Many of our own pupils are leaving the Jedi order to follow the Sith teachings, we need recruits to stand against Malak! With Revan dead...
7231 := Are you certain Revan is truly dead? What if we undertake to train this one, and the Dark Lord should return?
7232 := We should discuss this matter more fully in private. Bastila, you and your companion must go. This is a matter for the Council alone.
7233 := As you wish, Master Vandar. We shall return to the Ebon Hawk and leave you to your deliberations. 
7234 := Do not worry. I am confident in your ability to learn.
7235 := Ah, good. Now that you have selected your crystal, we shall begin the construction of your lightsaber.
7236 := You should speak to Master Dorak. He can assist you in selecting your lightsaber crystal.
7237 := [Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.
7238 := [Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!
7239 := [Lie] No, I was somewhere else.
7240 := I want to ask some questions, Master Zhar. Questions about Revan and Malak.
7241 := I should be going now. 
7242 := What happened? 
7243 := What happened to this noble mission?
7244 := Yeah, yeah, get on with it.
7245 := I will heed the lesson, Master Zhar.
7246 := They disobeyed the Jedi Council!
7247 := Not right now.
7248 := I am ready to continue my training.
7249 := What's causing this corruption?
7250 := You know more than you're telling me...
7251 := Do you have no other guidance?
7252 := You want me to go kill kath hounds?
7253 := What would you have me do, Master Zhar?
7254 := Let's get these tests over with! 
7255 := There is harmony. 
7256 := There is peace. 
7257 := There is knowledge.
7258 := There is peace.
7259 := There is serenity.
7260 := There is harmony.
7261 := There is the Force.
7262 := There is justice.
7263 := There is the Force.
7264 := There is knowledge.
7265 := There is serenity.
7266 := There is the light. 
7267 := What kind of tests are these? 
7268 := I am ready for the tests, Master Zhar.
7269 := Should I know anything else about lightsabers?
7270 := I need more time to prepare myself.
7271 := I am ready to face the third trial.
7272 := What will these crystals do for me?
7273 := I can find crystals on Dantooine?
7274 := I've got some questions for all of you.
7275 := Why did the Sith destroy Taris?
7276 := I feel I'm not going to like this...
7277 := Me? What about me?
7278 := Why am I here?
7279 := Why am I a special case?
7280 := Isn't the Jedi Council on Coruscant?
7281 := So you've drawn me into your little trap, Bastila. What now?
7282 := What do you want from me?
7283 := Strong in the Force?
7284 := [Lie] Of course, great Jedi. I will learn your ways and follow the light.
7285 := I am ready to accept the training... and my age has nothing to do with it!
7286 := I am willing to try my best.
7287 := I don't know if I'm ready for this. 
7288 := Nothing would give me greater honor than learning the ways of the Jedi.
7289 := It's so different here, so alive. I can't remember seeing green on Tatooine
7290 := I wish Ward could have come here with us. I miss him.
7291 := You've helped so much. It's good that I can tell my children that there are nice people in the galaxy.
7292 := Thank you again. We've got a chance now, and it's all because of you.
7293 := Hello there, I... it's you! I remember you! You're the one that gave me the credits to leave Tatooine! I could never forget your face.
7294 := Thank you so much for what you did. Here on Dantooine, we've got a chance. 
7295 := Er... all right then. But thank you again. I couldn't have made it here without you.
7296 := Thank you. I won't trouble you any more, but... thank you.
7297 := I found a small apartment for now. They're resting now. They're still getting used to the new surroundings.
7298 := Once I'm working I'll see about getting them into school. There are opportunities here they would have never had on Tatooine.
7299 := Well, I may be able to get hired as a servant for one of the influential families here. I haven't yet, but I'm sure I will.
7300 := At least there's hope here. Tatooine was just dying, all of it.
7301 := Yes, yes, I have to go.
7302 := I'm glad I could help.
7303 := Where are your children?
7304 := Sharina, wasn't it? What will you do here?

7470 := Dantooine - Courtyard
7471 := I...
7472 := Aren't you just a sweet little droid, yes you are!
7473 := My droid is still missing. I can feel him like a hole in my aching heart.
7474 := Please, if you come across my droid, bring him to me. I need him so much...
7475 := He is out there still? I must find him!
7476 := [Success] My droid... destroyed? No, no! This cannot be happening! I can't bear to live without him!
7477 := Greetings, young Jedi, I wonder if you could assist me. I seem to have lost my... companion, you see.
7478 := Please, I beg of you, I must find him. How can you leave him out there with so many dangerous beasts and predators? Have you no humanity?
7479 := Please, if you do see him, return him to me. He is so far from home... He is a C8 model droid about a meter and a half tall...
7480 := Well... yes... he is a droid.
7481 := But he is very valuable to me all the same! He is the last piece of my poor, passed-away husband that I have left.
7482 := He is very dear to me, my precious is. I don't know what I'd do without him!
7483 := He's the only companionship I have on all of Dantooine!
7484 := He is a personal assistance droid. My husband was a genius at constructing droids. He made this one capable of taking care of me for the rest of my life.
7485 := As the last legacy of my husband, for my own personal ease of mind, I need him back! His absence gnaws at me like a gaping wound.
7486 := Please, I beg of you, return my droid to me!
7487 := Please! Should you find him, send him home to me!
7488 := Thank you! Thank you, master Jedi! If you find him, please send him home to me. I need him so much!
7489 := Wow. She really misses her droid, doesn't she?
7490 := There is no need for you to make fun of her. She is obviously desperate.
7491 := I'll say.
7492 := Carth! Enough!
7493 := Beep! Beep-beep boople boop!
7494 := Oh, I'm sorry, master Jedi, I did not give you a proper introduction. I am Elise Montagne. I own the farm to the north of here.
7495 := But I really am in need of your assistance. Time may be critical with so many kath hounds about. Oh, and those Mandalorians! Please, will you help me find him?
7496 := We were working on my farm to the north of here. I was working in the garden outside, and he was working inside.
7497 := I heard the door to the house open, but not close. I went to see and found it wide open!
7498 := I searched everywhere, and could not find him! I worry so much. I need him back so badly. I wonder if he... Could he have been kidnapped?
7499 := Not that I know of... Er... *ahem* None of my neighbors really know he's there.
7500 := Kath hounds are not intelligent enough to open doors. Although they have been more vicious lately...
7501 := No, it must have been someone who could open the door by himself. Come to think of it, the door was locked!
7502 := Well... Yes, it could have. But he had no reason to run away! His programming...
7503 := He was supposed to be completely loyal! To serve me after my husband died!
7504 := Beep! Beep-beep boople boop!
7505 := No, the door was undamaged and showed no signs of tampering...
7506 := Maybe it was the Mandalorians... or maybe kath hounds. But... no...
7507 := I am sorry, I must be going.
7508 := Do not worry, I will find him.
7509 := Could you tell me what happened to him?
7510 := Your droid escaped and is nowhere to be found. He's still out there somewhere.
7511 := I am afraid your droid had to be destroyed.
7512 := [Lie] I found your droid... but he had been destroyed by kath hounds.
7513 := I am sorry, I have no time for this.
7514 := No means no.
7515 := You expect me to run off to find some stupid droid??
7516 := A droid?!?
7517 := Your missing companion is a droid??
7518 := What exactly did you use him for again?
7519 := You live alone with this... droid?
7520 := I am not interested.
7521 := If I happen to see him, I will send him back to you.
7522 := I will help you find your droid.
7523 := Yes, Teethree, I understand that you're concerned about him, too...
7524 := Alright, I will help you. Tell what happened.
7525 := Who are you?
7526 := Your companion?
7527 := Does anyone hold a grudge against him?
7528 := Could it have been kath hounds?
7529 := Could it have been opened from the inside?
7530 := Yes, Teethree, I understand that you're concerned about him, too...
7531 := Could someone have bypassed the lock?
7532 := Did someone break it down?
7533 := It is possible...
7534 := Oh, thank you! Thank you!
7535 := I don't know what I would have done if I had lost him!
7536 := It's just soo great to have him back!
7537 := We're just going to go right home, right now, and celebrate, aren't we, my lovely little droid?
7538 := Don't worry, I'm going to hug you and oil you and care for you and make sure you never ever get away again.
7539 := Please kill me...
7540 := Ha! Better get used to it, droid!
7541 := [sadly] Beep boop-oop.
7542 := I don't think I've ever felt so bad for a droid before.
7543 := I'll be waiting for you, Master Jedi.
7544 := No...
7545 := I...
7546 := It's...
7547 := I agree. Completely.
7548 := It is relaxing to come outside and enjoy the fresh air once in a while. It relieves stress.
7549 := If you are seeking information, perhaps the Jedi Council will help. I am afraid I cannot.
7550 := Dantooine has a splendid environment. I would hate to see it damaged by too many settlers.
7551 := I fear it is only a matter of time before the Sith find us here, too...
7552 := I hear that the Sith have defeated another Republic battlefleet. I do not know how much longer the Republic can last.
7553 := Please, don't disturb me; I have pressing matters at hand.
7554 := The kath hounds have been very active of late. The settlers feel they are becoming more dangerous.
7555 := The kath hounds seem to have calmed down. The settlers must be relieved.
7556 := Good day to you. I am afraid I cannot speak to you at the moment. I apologize.
7557 := Thank you for exacting my revenge on those Mandalorian beasts. If only I could have been the one to tear out Sheruk's heart.
7558 := Now those Mandalorians know what it's like to be hunted!
7559 := But now that you've killed some of them, they won't stop until you've defeated their leader. You must find him and kill him, too.
7560 := Thank you, young Jedi.
7561 := Have you found the Mandalorian raiders yet?
7562 := Please! Find them and destroy them before they kill anyone else!
7563 := Not much that would help you, I'm afraid. They're Mandalorians in their battle armor with some Duros allies. They came down on us on landspeeders, so they could be anywhere by now.
7564 := One thing I do remember when those dogs killed my Ilsa, is that their leader was a giant of a man... who wielded a lightsaber.
7565 := Mandalorians have never been open to your ways. They are much too barbaric and violent.
7566 := I rather think that it may have been from some poor Jedi he had slain before. You can see now that he is as much of a threat to you as to me! You must kill them!
7567 := They have been troubling farms in the south most recently, having already dealt with many to the north. Please go there, find them and kill them!
7568 := Practical.
7569 := Yes it was. Mandalorians have never been open to the ways of the Jedi. They are much too barbaric and violent.
7570 := Please, help us if you can! They are as much a danger to you as to us! It is only a matter of time before they come here...
7571 := Good, good! Put them down like the animals they are!
7572 := Thank you, young Master. My daughter can now, I think, rest in peace.
7573 := Here is the reward I promised you.
7574 := Wha... what? I did not think the Jedi were so greedy. You seem almost Mandalorian.
7575 := I thank you for what you have done for me, but I have nothing else to give. The Council will hear of your deeds... and your greed.
7576 := No, please, take it. This pitiful amount will never be enough for what you have done for me.
7577 := Again, I thank you. I will be sure to tell the Council of your great deed.
7578 := Are you a Jedi? How long can you people continue to sit by and claim you protect us?
7579 := Protectors? Ha! You sit in your Enclave safe from the Mandalorians while we suffer!
7580 := No! They've been raiding planets across this sector, and farms around here often.
7581 := You Jedi have left them alone because they haven't harmed you, but they steal our property, destroy our land, and worse!
7582 := I say we look for these Mandalorians. I fought them in the war... they're nothing but vicious pirates. We should... we should stop them if we can.
7583 := Perhaps we should look into this matter. I was unaware of any Mandalorian activity here, myself.
7584 := Is that an impersonation of Bastila? If it is, it's a good one.
7585 := Carth, I'm standing right here.
7586 := And? What's your point?
7587 := Wow, talk about an ego trip! You Jedi aren't perfect; remember Revan and Malak? Maybe these Mandalorians are worth looking into.
7588 := Those Mandalorian brutes have killed my daughter!
7589 := They came to our land, demanding our livelihood. But Ilsa, my Ilsa, said no...
7590 := She was always impulsive... *sob*
7591 := There was nothing I could do... Too many of the Mandalorians and their Duros allies...
7592 := I've come here to ask you, please, master Jedi, stop these raiders and get revenge for my daughter.
7593 := Please, I beg of you! Find the Mandalorian raiders and destroy them so my daughter can rest in peace!
7594 := I will give you all I have, just please, annihilate them from the face of this planet!
7595 := But you have been accepted into the Order. Yours is the authority of the Jedi.
7596 := You should have protected her better. And you call yourself her father.
7597 := And what am I supposed to do against a dozen Mandalorians and Duros? Nothing... There was nothing I could do...
7598 := I will come back if I find their leader.
7599 := No, I have not found them yet.
7600 := What do you know about these raiders?
7601 := What does this mean?
7602 := He was Jedi?
7603 := A lightsaber??
7604 := I didn't say I was going to find them!
7605 := I killed some of them on the plains.
7606 := I fought and killed their leader.
7607 := What?? That's it? Give me more!
7608 := There is no need for a reward.
7609 := Thank you, Jon.
7610 := Mandalorians? They were all beaten in the last war.
7611 := We are Jedi. What we decide is always right.
7612 := What are you talking about?
7613 := You didn't try to stop them?
7614 := Only an idiot says no when they have a gun in their face.
7615 := They killed her?
7616 := Revenge is never a good reason.
7617 := Your problems are not my concern.
7618 := Those animals! I'll kill them for what they did to your daughter!
7619 := I will protect you and your fellow settlers.
7620 := Maybe you could make it worth my while.
7621 := I am not a Jedi yet.
7622 := You return, yes? What else do you wish from me?
7623 := Ah, yes, you are a Jedi. I am grateful that your people harbor me in my times of need.
7624 := Yes, yes. Jedi always have more to attend to. Good day, friend Jedi.
7625 := After my flight, all I have left to give is my thanks, which your Order gladly has.
7626 := I am a victim, a refugee, yes. I flee... fled from my world once the Sith fleet comes. They bomb my world, destroy it, yes?
7627 := They scour the continents, boil the oceans. Sith are bad, yes.
7628 := But I run here, find the Jedi already here, unknown. They take me in... one left of a billion, yes...
7629 := The Republic fights, but does not win. Not you to blame, of course, no. The Sith are strong and destroy those who would oppose them, yes.
7630 := My thanks you have, and your Order. Is there anything else you require?
7631 := I must be going now.
7632 := You might give something back...
7633 := What happened to you?
7634 := It is good, sometimes, to stop and reflect on the beauty of nature and the Force.
7635 := How go your studies, my young friend?
7636 := I am sorry, I tend to get carried away... I do not believe we have met, apprentice. My name is Nemo.
7637 := Is there something I can help you with?
7638 := I hope your time is well spent here on Dantooine.
7639 := About me? I am truly flattered. What is it you wish to know?
7640 := *chuckle* The importance you put in a name is misleading, young one. You of all people should remember that.
7641 := I am here by the will of the Jedi Council. I serve the good and, hopefully through that, the people of the Republic.
7642 := Is there something else I can help you with?
7643 := As I have said, I believe, my name is Nemo. I am here by the will of the Jedi Council.
7644 := Indeed, my young friend, that I am. I have served the Council for many years, and have seen many apprentices pass through this Enclave.
7645 := I think, perhaps, you place an undue importance on rank and hierarchy. Understandable, but regrettable also. We each serve in our place, high or low.
7646 := Very well, what is it you wish to know?
7647 := Ah, yes, those caves. Those caves are dangerous for the unwary.
7648 := Kinrath spiders infest the places. They are attracted by the colors and heat given off by the crystals, I think.
7649 := It is a pity... Those caves are strong with the Force.
7650 := Mandalorian raiders, yes. They have been preying on the settlers in the surrounding farms. Stealing food, money, weapons... Jon was hit really hard recently... He lost his daughter.
7651 := They were not a problem before... But now it would seem prudent to be rid of them. If you could accomplish this, it would not harm your training and the settlers would greatly appreciate it.
7652 := Jon is currently waiting to petition the Council. He is on the path north of here. He might be able to tell you more about what had happened.
7653 := Can I help with anything else?
7654 := You Republics are too weak. You should protect what you want to keep, otherwise someone stronger will take it.
7655 := Perhaps, perhaps. But not everyone in the galaxy is a warrior like you.
7656 := Ah, you can find two stores here at the Enclave. Aratech has opened both a general supply store and a droid facility and I think you will find their products quite good.
7657 := The supply store is run by a Twi'lek name Crattis Yurkal. A talkative being with a big chip on his shoulder, but generous despite that.
7658 := The droid repair facility is managed by Karal Kaar. A bit brusque, perhaps, but a good being nonetheless. We have shared many a game of Pazaak in the small hours of the morning.
7659 := Is there something else I can help you with?
7660 := Indeed. What is it you would like from me?
7661 := Very well.
7662 := The Council has told you nothing of the grove?
7663 := Do not be so quick to judge circumstances about which you are ignorant. Not everything may be as transparent as you would believe.
7664 := Then it would not be my place to explain its significance.
7665 := But as the light side can be embodied in living beings, so can the dark.
7666 := The grove can be found to the south and east in the plains. But be wary of kath hounds, they may be agitated by the power in the grove.
7667 := The Code is a way of life, not a strict set of laws. It would be wise for you to reflect on them, rather than rote memorization.
7668 := But still you must learn.
7669 := There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is peace. There is no death; there is the Force.
7670 := Live by these precepts and you will not fail, young apprentice.
7671 := Is there something else I can help you with?
7672 := Greetings, Master Nemo. It is good to see you again.
7673 := And you, dear one, as always. Have you learned to control your temper yet, girl... or does your master still douse you with a bucket of water?
7674 := Ahhh... well, it is --
7675 := As I thought. Don't worry, young one... you shall learn, in time. Have patience.
7676 := Juhani has been slain, I hear. You fought with her in the grove?
7677 := Even in the darkest heart there is hope for rebirth. Anyone can be turned back to the light. Anyone.
7678 := It should not have had to go that far... but some things cannot be avoided.
7679 := You would do well to mind Juhani's tragic example and not to let yourself fall into the sway of the dark side.
7680 := I hear you managed to return Juhani to the Order. Congratulations.
7681 := I regret not being able to tell you more, but some things you must see with your own eyes.
7682 := I must be going now.
7683 := I would like to know about you.
7684 := What kind of a name is Nemo anyway?
7685 := What do you do here?
7686 := I would like to ask you something else.
7687 := Who are you?
7688 := You are a Jedi?
7689 := I want to ask you something else.
7690 := Are you a member of the Council?
7691 := I have a question about Dantooine.
7692 := Master Zhar said there are caves on Dantooine with lightsaber crystals.
7693 := I've heard people mention Mandalorians.
7694 := Where can I find a store?
7695 := I have been given a task by the Council...
7696 := Um... never mind.
7697 := What do you know of the tainted grove?
7698 := I know it is tainted by the dark side.
7699 := No, they have not.
7700 := I want to know about the Jedi Code.
7701 := She deserved to die.
7702 := She had been turned to the dark side!
7703 := She attacked me.
7704 := Please be careful on the plains, Padawan. Kath hounds are about.
7705 := Please be careful on the plains, apprentice. Kath hounds are about.
7706 := I don't understand why the Jedi Council are hiding here. Shouldn't they be helping the Republic?
7707 := I hear the Sith have been beating the Republic pretty bad. They must've spent the whole time building ships since we beat them last time.
7708 := Those damn Mandalorians have been raiding farms all over this continent. The Jedi won't do anything, so where does that leave us?
7709 := I heard the Jedi finally got off their behinds and did something about the Mandalorians! Took them long enough!
7710 := The Council's been telling us not to go near the stones to the east. Just as well, the kath hounds near there seem a lot more vicious...
7711 := You know those stones to the east of here? I heard they did some digging and found they aren't natural.
7712 := Rahasia Sandral is a nice young woman. But her father has been keeping her at their estate since her brother went missing...
7713 := I heard there was fighting coreward towards Coruscant. I wonder if the Republic will survive...
7714 := Ahlan Matale likes to lord his wealth over the rest of us. What I wouldn't give for him to eat his own words... His son seems like a nice boy though.
7715 := Did you hear? Shen Matale and Rahasia Sandral are getting married! I would never have thought their fathers would allow it!
7716 := The children of Nurik Sandral and Ahlan Matale apparently fled here to the Enclave. Their families are both very mad.
7717 := Ahlan Matale locked himself up in his estate with his son. I wonder what the boy did.
7718 := Did you hear? The Sandrals and Matales massacred each other! It's horrible!
7719 := Master Quatra was hurt very badly. She might die. I heard it was her own apprentice that did it.
7720 := I heard another Republic fleet was wiped out in this sector! I hope they don't find the Jedi here!
7721 := Did you hear about the young Jedi girl from a couple days ago? I heard she hurt her master pretty bad...
7722 := One of the Jedi managed to turn that Dark Jedi girl back to the light side. That's a relief!
7723 := I heard the rogue Jedi girl was killed. Good riddance! We don't need any Dark Jedi here on Dantooine!
7724 := Hello. I'm afraid I'm not very good at explaining things. If you have any questions, please ask my husband.
7725 := I hope the Jedi Council will listen to Gar. If they don't, I don't know what we'll do...
7726 := How may I be of assistance?
7727 := Farewell, then. May the Force be with you, is that how it goes? Yes, may the Force be with you.
7728 := My name is Gar. Me and my fine wife Rilka here...
7729 := A pleasure.
7730 := ... live on one of the northern farms. But the kath hounds and the Mandalorian problem has been getting really bad of late, and we're here to ask the Jedi Council to help.
7731 := Well, as you can see here, Dantooine is mostly plains and grassland, but it has nice hearty soil. A lot of new people have come in the last generation or so.
7732 := Hm... the ones you'll most likely hear about are the Sandrals and Matales. Big, wealthy land-owners, both of them.
7733 := But Ahlan Matale and Nurik Sandral just can't seem to get along, and now Ahlan wants to get the Council to do something.
7734 := Well... from what I hear it started about a week ago. See, Nurik's son Casus is an archeologist, bright lad too, but he disappeared. Nurik of course blamed Ahlan, but even he didn't take it before the Council.
7735 := But now Ahlan's son Shen has disappeared as well... and no one knows where he's gone. Ahlan blames Nurik. He thinks he's kidnapped his son.
7736 := I don't know exactly what he wants to ask the Council, but from what I know of Ahlan, he's probably going to be after blood...
7737 := Ever since the Republic beat them years ago, little groups have been roaming all over the place.
7738 := With the Sith invasion, the Republic doesn't have the manpower to hunt them down.
7739 := The Jedi are even worse off because Malak has been hunting them specifically.
7740 := They're worried that he might even be supporting these raiders, so don't want to face them directly. That puts us in a kind of hard situation.
7741 := Is there anything else I can help you with?
7742 := They're pathetic. They're taking scraps when they should be taking worlds.
7743 := Recently the kath hounds have been acting much more aggressively. They've even attacked some of the settlers!
7744 := Those Mandalorian raiders have been milking the outlying farms dry, too... I hear Jon got hit really bad. Too bad about his daughter.
7745 := I'm not sure exactly what the Council will do about it, but we need some help with this. I only hope they'll listen to me...
7746 := Is there anything else you require?
7747 := His daughter was killed by Mandalorians when their farm was raided. He's been taking it pretty hard. If you want to ask him about it, he's just north of here. It's not my place to say anything else.
7748 := Is there anything else you require?
7749 := He should have been protecting her better if he wanted to keep her.
7750 := Mandalorian beast! Some of us don't like fighting and killing and butchering as much as you!
7751 := Don't be so heartless, Mandalorian.
7752 := How may I be of assistance, Master Jedi?
7753 := Ah, but you are still a Jedi.
7754 := Greetings, friend. I think I can safely assume you are a member of the Jedi Order. Has the Council agreed to hear our petition?
7755 := Ve... very well. Thank you, Master Jedi.
7756 := Oh, I see. I am mistaken.
7757 := Ah! Yes, thank you, Master Jedi.
7758 := Stay here Rilka, I'll be back in an hour or so.
7759 := Yes, dear. Good luck.
7760 := Ah. I'm sorry. I was mistaken.
7761 := Does the Council require our presence?
7762 := I must be going now.
7763 := What can you tell me about Dantooine?
7764 := Who are you?
7765 := Are there many farms here on Dantooine?
7766 := I would like to ask you something else.
7767 := Do something? Has something happened?
7768 := Mandalorians? Here?
7769 := You mentioned kath hounds?
7770 := What about Jon and his daughter?
7771 := I am not a Jedi Master yet.
7772 := I don't know anything. Leave me alone.
7773 := I am sorry. I do not know.
7774 := Yes, they are waiting for you now.
7775 := I am merely an apprentice, not a Jedi.

7851 := Dantooine - Matale Grounds
7852 := Until you find Shen, Jedi, we have nothing further to discuss. I suggest you hurry south to their estate, lest I take matters into my own hands. 
7853 := I've seen men like Ahlan Matale before. He's so convinced that his hatred is justified he's prepared to do anything. And if we don't intervene, there will be war.
7854 := Fathers can be blind sometimes. There is more to this.
7855 := This guy's a real pain! It wouldn't surprise me if Shen ran off just to get away from his father!
7856 := I'm afraid Ahlan is not just making idle threats. He is rash and foolish enough to attempt a full assault on the Sandral estate. Such action would result in all-out war between the families.
7857 := My protocol droid tells me you are here on behalf of the Council. I was beginning to think my demands had been ignored.
7858 := Though I think your time would be better spent interrogating the Sandrals as to the whereabouts of my son Shen!
7859 := Proof? How dare you talk to me about proof! I have more than enough to satisfy any reasonable person!
7860 := I have already told my story to the Council! Why did they not inform you of my circumstances? I did not expect such incompetence from the Jedi, but I shall repeat the tale once more...
7861 := Many years ago I brought my family here to Dantooine to escape the crush of humanity on the Core Worlds.
7862 := Soon after we settled here, the Sandrals arrived. And they have been a plague upon my house ever since!
7863 := The injustices the Sandrals have committed against the Matales are far too numerous to name, but the Council is well aware of our many disputes.
7864 := Recently, I discovered several Sandral droids trespassing on my land.
7865 := My own security droids destroyed the invaders - not a single one survived.
7866 := I have no idea what nefarious purpose lay behind their arrival - my own assassination, perhaps. Destruction of my property. Maybe a simple spy mission. I wasn't about to find out. 
7867 := It was shortly after this incident that Shen, my only son and heir to the Matale estate, vanished.
7868 := Obviously Nurik, the unscrupulous head of the Sandral clan, has abducted my son in retaliation for the destruction of his droids!
7869 := Follow their stink south of here and you shall find them. I demand action on this matter, Jedi!
7870 := Why does the Council insist on stalling? The life of my son is at stake! Is it possible... yes, of course. Now I understand.
7871 := I am a man of the world, Jedi. I know how things are done. I will make a... contribution... of 1,000 credits to the Council in exchange for rescuing Shen from the Sandrals. 
7872 := I will present the credits directly to you, of course. Whether the Council ever learns of this "donation" is completely up to you. 
7873 := Two thousand? Your greed is outstripped only by your utter lack of any sense of proportion, Jedi!
7874 := For that price I could purchase enough droids to destroy the entire Sandral estate. Two thousand is out of the question.
7875 := Two thousand? Even if he would pay such a fee, what could you possibly need so many credits for?
7876 := You must not give in to your baser desires. The lure of the dark side is strong.
7877 := Nevertheless, my offer still stands. A thousand credits for Shen's safe return. Know, however, that I will not sit idly by much longer. 
7878 := Eventually I will take whatever action is necessary to rescue my son... including razing the entire Sandral estate!
7879 := You would be willing to risk open war over this?
7880 := It is the Sandrals who have started this. Not I.
7881 := And here I thought you would blame us, if we failed. It seems everyone is responsible for your actions except for you.
7882 := I don't need to stand here and listen to such impertinence!
7883 := I'm impressed, Carth. That interjection was very Jedi-like.
7884 := What can I say? You pick up a few things.
7885 := The only resolution possible is the immediate return of my son! 
7886 := I have no idea what nefarious purpose lay behind their arrival - my own assassination, perhaps. Destruction of my property. Maybe a simple spy mission. I wasn't about to find out.
7887 := My own security droids destroyed the invaders - not a single one survived. 
7888 := [Alarmed] Beep beep!
7889 := At least you're efficient.
7890 := Somehow I imagine the story from the Sandrals would sound just about the same, don't you?
7891 := You can't accuse the Sandrals without proof.
7892 := Any information you might have would be helpful.
7893 := Why are you so certain the Sandrals are to blame? 
7894 := What happened to the droids? 
7895 := Where can I find the Sandrals?
7896 := You are jumping to conclusions.
7897 := Make it 2,000 and you have a deal. 
7898 := I understand you are upset, Ahlan Matale. Rest assured I will find Shen.
7899 := The Jedi cannot be bought! I will remain neutral despite your attempted bribe!
7900 := I shall go and speak to Nurik Sandral.
7901 := What were they doing here?
7902 := Err... no, I don't think the droids were very frightened, Teethree.
7903 := Jarg, did you remember not to take the XT-model bike out today? There was something funny with one of the intakes, and I thought it could jam.
7904 := Ha! Consider yourself lucky! If someone was dumb enough to take that thing out he would have ploughed right into the ground within a kilometer.
7905 := Master Matale is grateful for the return of Shen. He has sealed the estate and cannot see you, however. Please move along.
7906 := [Angrily] Beep beep-eep!
7907 := I do as I am told. Insults will get you nowhere.
7908 := [Angrily] Beep!
7909 := So this is how nobles show their gratitude. No wonder all my friends are soldiers.
7910 := Figures. We get his son back for him, and now the stuck-up estate owner won't have anything to do with us!
7911 := Master Matale has left orders to deny you entrance into the estate. He suspects you to be in league with the Sandrals.
7912 := A grievance will be filed with the Council for your actions. 
7913 := I am sure the Council will realize these accusations are completely unfounded. The Matale grievance will fall on deaf ears. 
7914 := Return the young Master Matale to this estate. His father may order preemptive action if this is not done.
7915 := This is private property! By what authority are you trespassing on this estate?
7916 := I am programmed not to respond to threats until attacked directly. I have been programmed to defend myself accordingly.
7917 := But even if I am terminated, another will take my place. You will still be denied entrance.
7918 := And don't think I wouldn't enjoy blowing you to bits.
7919 := Leave immediately. Only those on official family business are permitted within the estate.
7920 := These settlers have come to Dantooine seeking privacy. Perhaps we should respect their wishes.
7921 := You have come from the Jedi Council? Master Matale wishes to speak with you. I will inform him that you are here. Remain at this location until he arrives.
7922 := My weapons are my authority!
7923 := I'm sorry, I'll be going now.
7924 := I come on behalf of the Jedi Council. I wish to speak to Ahlan Matale.

8001 := Yes? Is there something I can do to help you in this investigation?
8002 := Are you certain? It would be beneficial to your training if you were to at least make the attempt.
8003 := By assisting me with this case you may learn much about how well you have learned the wisdom of the Jedi... or how much further you have yet to go.
8004 := If you give up now, I will take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself. But you will have missed out on an excellent opportunity.
8005 := Very well. I will take these two suspects to the Enclave and judge this case myself.
8006 := May the Force be with you.
8007 := Good. We Jedi are often called on to rule in difficult cases such as these, yet if we do not have experience with them our wisdom is of little use.
8008 := We should provide what help we can. Surely it is not that difficult to ascertain the truth.
8009 := We should assist Jedi Bolook as best we can.
8010 := When you have gathered all the information you need, come back to me and we can try to determine what happened.
8011 := So to add to all this, Handon as much as admitted he would have liked to assault Calder because Calder was in some sort of relationship with Handon's wife.
8012 := Rickard, on the other hand, insists that everything between himself and Calder was going great. He was becoming quite beligerent about the fact too.
8013 := What sense does all this make? Who killed Calder Nettic?
8014 := A bold conclusion... one most people would not arrive at. But we are not like most people, we are Jedi. Still, I would like to know how you came to this conclusion.
8015 := What? How could that have worked?
8016 := Yes, well done! Both men had a reason to want Calder dead. This is my theory of this morning's events: both men knew Calder would be out here this morning and each plotted to kill him.
8017 := Handon would have dropped his blaster - the one we found at the scene covered in blood. He probably thought Rickard was going to kill him so he called us, hoping he could convince us it was Rickard.
8018 := And I would have got away with it if it wasn't for you meddling Jedi!
8019 := But why did Rickard shoot Handon?
8020 := That is not a reason. I find your logic severely flawed. I think it is rather likely that he thought it was Calder that he was shooting.
8021 := I think it rather likely that he thought it was Calder that he was shooting.
8022 := Maybe he thought he was shooting Calder?
8023 := Yes, that would make sense. He did have a motive to kill Calder as well. He most likely did think that it was Calder he was shooting at. He might have even thought he succeeded.
8024 := Damn you! Damn both of you!
8025 := That is enough. The culpability of both of you in the murder - and attempted murder - of Calder Nettic is evident. Additionally, Rickard Lusoff can be charged with aggravated assault and attempted murder of Handon Guld.
8026 := I place you both under the arrest of the Jedi Order, and will escort you to holding facilities in the Jedi Enclave.
8027 := You have done well here, it is obvious you have been studying your lessons carefully. I will be sure to inform the Jedi Council of your performance in this little test.
8028 := Good day, and may the Force be with you.
8029 := [happily]  Beep-beep boop!
8030 := You did good. You might just make a proper Jedi yet, who knows?
8031 := Well done. I am impressed... I'm not sure I could have done as well.
8032 := What?? I wasn't in anything with that fool Handon! The man I shot... uh...
8033 := See! I told you!
8034 := It appears that Mr. Lusoff has incriminated himself enough. I believe we have found the killer.
8035 := Good, good. I assume I am permitted to leave now?
8036 := A Jedi does not exploit their position! Have you learned nothing during your training?
8037 := The judgment has been rendered. You may leave, Mr. Guld.  For now.
8038 := What! No, dammit!
8039 := Yes, Mr. Lusoff? Is there something wrong? Do you not feel justice has been done here? Do you not feel you should be taken to the Enclave for sentencing?
8040 := No! If I'm going, I'm going to take him with me! You don't know anything about what happened!
8041 := Yeah, I came out here to kill Calder. The Hutt-spawn was funneling credits from our business and we were going under because of it.
8042 := But if I'm getting caught, I'm not going to go down by myself! You two idiots let the real killer go!
8043 := It seems you were a bit rash in your investigation. You should have examined the relationship between Calder and Handon more thoroughly. Surely we could have found some evidence of this.
8044 := Yes, you green-skinned nerfherder!
8045 := I came out here to kill Calder and when I saw someone over by the bridge I shot him. But Handon had already killed him!
8046 := I will return to the Enclave with Mr. Lusoff, and I will have Mr. Guld apprehended. It is a minor inconvenience, but one well worth the cost if you have learned a lesson here.
8047 := I realized your judgment was incorrect, but I allowed you to make it so you could understand that there are always consequences to our actions. As a Jedi you must always remember this.
8048 := What?? What are you talking about? I don't want that bantha of a wife Handon has!
8049 := Shut your mouth! I'll kill you just like I... er...
8050 := Just like he killed Calder!
8051 := It appears that Mr. Guld has incriminated himself enough. I believe we have found the killer.
8052 := I can leave now, then?
8053 := That is a most unbecoming attitude for a Jedi. I will be sure to inform the Council of it.
8054 := The judgment has been rendered. You may leave, Mr. Lusoff. For now.
8055 := What! No!
8056 := Yes, Mr. Guld? Is there something wrong? Do you not feel justice has been done here? Do you not feel you should be taken to the Enclave for sentencing?
8057 := No! If I'm going, I'm not going alone! You don't know what you've done!
8058 := Look, I came out here, I admit, to kill Calder, but so did Rickard! He must have thought it was Calder when he shot, and hit me!
8059 := So I'm going to prison, but I shouldn't be going alone! Did you idiots have to let the slime-ball go?
8060 := It appears your investigations were incomplete. I imagine if we examine the business records we will discover Calder had been cheating Rickard.
8061 := Yes, you tentacle-headed moron!
8062 := I came out here and killed Calder, but Rickard was here to do that too and he shot me by mistake!
8063 := I will return to the Enclave with Mr. Guld in custody, and I will also have the authorities apprehend Mr. Lusoff. It is a minor inconvenience, but one well worth the cost if you have learned your lesson here.
8064 := I realized your judgment was incorrect, but I allowed you to make it so you could understand that there are always consequences to our actions. As a Jedi you must always remember this.
8065 := Interesting. And why do you believe that? What possible motive could he have had?
8066 := Hm... that is a possibility, but unlikely. There is no evidence of a weapon at all, other than Handon's.
8067 := I do not believe that was the case. The facts in this investigation do not point towards such a motive. There are too many facts that point towards other possibilities.
8068 := I have no idea upon what you based that assumption. I assure you that no facts in this case point towards that possibility at all.
8069 := Yes, I believe that has some truth in it. It would be quite a motive for him to seek revenge upon Mr. Nettic.
8070 := And so you have made your judgment in this case.
8071 := An interesting theory, but what do you base that on? What possible motive could he have had?
8072 := Yes, I concur. That is a good motive for Handon to have. And Handon being the killer matches with the facts of the case as presented so far.
8073 := And so you have made your judgment in this case.
8074 := I do not believe that was the case. The facts in this investigation do not point towards such an event taking place. There are too many points that show intent for it to be a random killing.
8075 := I do not believe your logic is up to the task of deciding who is guilty in this case. I will take these men to the enclave and deal with this matter myself.
8076 := Do not despair. Although you couldn't solve the case you handled yourself in a manner befitting a Jedi. Once you have more training and experience I am certain you will be able to handle matters such as this.
8077 := [Failure] Do not try to use mental powers on me, human! I am far more advanced in my training than you!
8078 := I will take the suspects to the Enclave to judge them myself. Rest assured, I will give the Council a full account of your actions here.
8079 := [Failure] No, you have done what you can already, and it appears to be beyond your abilities. Perhaps with more training you would have done better.
8080 := [Success] Hm. You have been of great assistance already. Perhaps it was merely a mistake on your part.
8081 := Very well, you may yet discover who committed this crime. Who do you believe killed Calder Nettic?
8082 := Possible... but we have found no weapon anywhere. He could have dumped it in the river, but that is unlikely because it would have damaged the weapon.
8083 := I do not believe that was the case. The facts in this investigation do not point towards such an event taking place.
8084 := I assume the blood on the weapon belongs to the victim, but I want to be thorough. What have you learned about the blood on the weapon?
8085 := That is surprising. So the blood must belong to one of the suspects. But which one?
8086 := Rickard had said that he had previously twisted his ankle moving to the body. While I am not a specialist on human physiology, it does not seem that this sort of injury would result in blood loss.
8087 := Where does the truth lie?
8088 := Why do you believe that?
8089 := Hm... perhaps. We should examine him more closely then.
8090 := Hey! Quit it! *grumble*
8091 := Rickard does not seem to be bleeding. I am not sure that it would have been possible to get his blood on the weapon.
8092 := Why don't you check that Calder slime-ball, now that you've already roughed me up!
8093 := Why do you believe that?
8094 := Hm... Handon has been moving oddly since I arrived... Perhaps we should examine him a little more closely.
8095 := Hey! What are you doing!
8096 := There is blood! Handon appears to have suffered some sort of blaster wound to his side.
8097 := But if he was injured, who shot him?
8098 := That does not prove anything. You cannot assume somone's guilt except based on the facts we have observed.
8099 := It seems you are letting your personal biases influence you on this case.
8100 := I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.
8101 := I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.
8102 := I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
8103 := [Failure] Do not try to use mental powers on me, human! I am far more advanced in my training than you!
8104 := I will be sure to report your attempt to the Council when I wait there for their judgment.
8105 := [Failure] No, I do not have any more time to waste here. I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
8106 := [Success] Hm... Perhaps I should not take it to the Council so soon...
8107 := Yes, I believe I was hasty. You may have one more chance to figure out who the murderer is before I take the suspects back to the Council.
8108 := You do not seem to be as adept at human nature as I had first assumed for one of your species. If you do not determine something more valid soon, I will be forced to return with the suspects to the Enclave.
8109 := If you are unable to deduce the facts of this case, then I will take the suspects back to the Enclave and handle it myself. But since you have talked to the suspects, there is no harm in you trying further.
8110 := Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving what I could not. Where does the truth lie?
8111 := So, what have you determined about the weapon found by the body?
8112 := Handon says that the blaster was his, but that it was stolen from his home several days ago.
8113 := Rickard says that the blaster was not Calder's, and implies that if Calder was out here, it was either without a weapon, or his was taken.
8114 := Where does the truth lie?
8115 := Why do you believe that?
8116 := It seems unlikely that he would be. In fact, his explanation seems to make sense. The weapon is not owned by Calder, but rather by Handon.
8117 := Records show Calder possessed a heavily personalized Echani Mk 4 light blaster weapon, which was also not found near the body.
8118 := While he may not have had it on him at the time of his death, it does not contradict anything Rickard has said.
8119 := You should not use fabrication to replace true evidence.
8120 := Perhaps he could have. But Handon said he arrived before Rickard, and Rickard was seen coming out of the rocks.
8121 := You should not try to complicate a situation in order to arrive at a more uncertain guess.
8122 := True, but the blaster was Handon's, and he said it had been stolen. This, unfortunately, opens the possibility of a third party.
8123 := I do not relish that thought, and it somehow seems wrong to me. Additionally, Handon said that the weapon was already there when he arrived, and Rickard already had one.
8124 := It was not Calder's, so there must have been another person with the blaster. Presumably, this was the person who shot him.
8125 := Why do you believe that?
8126 := Perhaps, perhaps not. You speculate that he killed Calder. Indeed, that is what this investigation is about, but we deal only with concrete evidence.
8127 := Handon says that he came upon the body immediately before Rickard arrived, and Rickard did not see Handon approach in the short time it took to move from the rocks.
8128 := I find I cannot agree with your theory in this case. You should not try to fabricate situations to replace true evidence.
8129 := Yes, Handon's story does seem to have a major flaw in it: The weapon was not reported stolen.
8130 := It would seem very odd indeed that Handon would not have reported it, given the importance of weapons to survival on the plains of late.
8131 := Hm. We are nearing the end of their stories, but are still not much closer to finding the culprit than we were before.
8132 := Perhaps you should discuss the stories with both men some more.
8133 := You should probably inquire with both men about the blood found on the weapon.
8134 := Perhaps the blood on the weapon will yield more results.
8135 := True, but as we have already determined, that may be out of stupidity, rather than any malicious intent.
8136 := You should not fabricate motives to replace true evidence.
8137 := I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.
8138 := I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.
8139 := I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
8140 := [Failure] Do not try to use mental powers on me, human! I am far more advanced in my training than you!
8141 := I will be sure to report your attempt to the Council when I wait there for their judgment.
8142 := [Failure] No, I do not have any more time to waste here. I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
8143 := [Success] Hm... Perhaps I should not take it to the Council so soon...
8144 := Yes, I believe I was hasty. You may have one more chance to figure out who the murderer is before I take the suspects back to the Council.
8145 := You do not seem to be as adept at human nature as I had first assumed for one of your species. If you do not determine something more valid soon, I will be forced to return with the suspects to the Enclave.
8146 := If you are unable to deduce the facts of this case, perhaps we should go to the Council instead. But since you have talked to the suspects, there is no harm in you trying.
8147 := Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving what I could not. Where does the truth lie?
8148 := You should probably check about the weapon with the information droid. It may be able to confirm your evidence.
8149 := Our information is incomplete. You should probably inquire about the weapon with both men.
8150 := Next, Handon said he was just out running, but is probably lying because all settlers should carry weapons out on the plains and Handon had none. Rickard said he was out hunting iriaz.
8151 := Handon told me he barely knew the victim. On the other hand, Rickard and the victim were business partners.
8152 := However, according to Rickard they got along quite well. On the surface, neither man seems to have a motive for killing Calder.
8153 := Where does the truth lie?
8154 := Why do you believe that?
8155 := Your personal feelings towards the man should not influence your decision in this matter.
8156 := There is no emotion, there is peace. If you let your emotions rule your judgment you will be of little use in cases such as these.
8157 := You should try to remain objective in this.
8158 := I do not believe Rickard was lying about being in business with Calder. We have a record of that, fully registered and licenced.
8159 := It seems you are having trouble seperating the facts from wild guesses. Maybe I was mistaken in believing you were ready for this case.
8160 := It is not unusual for business partners to disagree sometimes, but if he found proof Calder was cheating him things could escalate to violence.
8161 := You theory does not seem to have much basis in the facts that we have hear so far.
8162 := Why do you believe that?
8163 := I have no idea what evidence you could base that on.
8164 := It is strange that Handon should be here at the exact time of the murder.
8165 := But, no, that is not any sort of firm evidence to prove that he was stalking Calder. It could still be simple chance.
8166 := Supposition does not equal evidence.
8167 := Well, that certainly is a motive for murder. The case is taking shape; however, you mustn't jump to any quick conclusions. Perhaps we should now focus on the murder weapon itself.
8168 := Supposition does not equal evidence.
8169 := I'm afraid you lack the wisdom to solve this case. Perhaps you need more training. In any case, I shall return with the suspects to the Enclave and deal with this myself.
8170 := I'm afraid you lack the wisdom to solve this case. Perhaps you need more training. In any case, I shall return with the suspects to the Enclave and deal with this myself.
8171 := I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
8172 := [Failure] Do not try to use mental powers on me, human! I am far more advanced in my training than you!
8173 := I will be sure to report your attempt to the Council when I wait there for their judgment.
8174 := [Failure] No, I do not have any more time to waste here. I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
8175 := [Success] Hm... Perhaps I should not take it to the Council so soon...
8176 := Yes, I believe I was hasty. You may have one more chance to figure out who the murderer is before I take the suspects back to the Council.
8177 := You do not seem to have learned your lessons as well as I would have hoped. If you do not determine something more valid soon, I will be forced to return with the suspects to the Enclave.
8178 := If you are unable to deduce the facts of this case, I will have to take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself. But since you have talked to the suspects, there is no harm in you trying a bit more.
8179 := Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving this. Where does the truth lie?
8180 := The Southwood company's record did say that Calder and Handon had rented a landspeeder together several times.
8181 := This shows that he did, in fact, know the victim. But this hardly counts as a motive for murder. I'm afraid I can't accept your judgment on this point.
8182 := You might want to see what information the witnesses and the information droid can provide you about the blaster found near the body.
8183 := This is getting too complicated for my limited understanding of humans... What could possibly have happened here?
8184 := It is most confusing.
8185 := We know Rickard lied about the sun blinding him while he was shooting, but we need more to go on. Let's examine the relationship of each man with the victim.
8186 := Now we must determine the relationship between each man and the victim. It would be a great help if we could find a reason either of the suspects would want Calder dead.
8187 := Rickard said that he shot the iriaz, which fell to the ground, but at the place it fell he found Handon standing over Calder's body instead.
8188 := Where does the truth lie?
8189 := Why do you believe that?
8190 := What? That is not proof that is an assumption. We are dealing with strictly facts here, and you would do well to remember that.
8191 := You should try to remain objective in this.
8192 := He may have lost sight of the location when he was coming out from the rocks or he may not have noticed Handon coming. But it may also be that he has not told us something.
8193 := It does not constitute firm evidence, however.
8194 := We have already determined that Rickard may not have been where he said he was, and we know that there was no dead iriaz present at the scene.
8195 := But we have no reason to doubt this part of his story. He could well have shot at it and had it run off.
8196 := It does not constitute firm evidence and does not contradict anything said so far.
8197 := Why do you believe that?
8198 := I believe you are prejudiced against him because of that fact. While it is true that he would have trouble running any great distance or for any length of time, he may still have been running.
8199 := It does not constitute firm evidence. You would do well to remain impartial and not let personal biases interfere in this.
8200 := You should try to remain objective in this.
8201 := We have no evidence of that.
8202 := He could have come out here with the intention of meeting Calder, but there is no proof of that.
8203 := It does not constitute firm evidence. It is an opinion based on too little fact.
8204 := I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.
8205 := I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.
8206 := I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
8207 := [Failure] Do not try to use mental powers on me, human! I am far more advanced in my training than you!
8208 := I will be sure to report your attempt to the Council when I wait there for their judgment.
8209 := [Failure] No, I do not have any more time to waste here. I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
8210 := [Success] Hm... Perhaps I should not take it to the Council so soon...
8211 := Yes, I believe I was hasty. You may have one more chance to figure out who the murderer is before I take the suspects back to the Council.
8212 := You do not seem to be as adept at human nature as I had first assumed for one of your species. If you do not determine something more valid soon, I will be forced to return with the suspects to the Enclave.
8213 := If you are unable to deduce the facts of this case, perhaps we should go to the Council instead. But since you have talked to the suspects, there is no harm in you trying.
8214 := Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving what I could not. Where does the truth lie?
8215 := It is odd that he would be out running alone, without a weapon for defense of any sort.
8216 := He would have to either be stupid or suicidal, and he does not appear to be the sort who would be either.
8217 := Hm... neither of these stories fits very well. There may be more to this murder than we had thought.
8218 := Very well. We should start at the beginning. If we find the truth behind each piece of the puzzle, we will no doubt resolve the case.
8219 := Handon said that he was nearby and heard a shot and ran over, only to find Calder already dead. He said Rickard came out of the shadow of the rocks holding a blaster in his hands.
8220 := Rickard said that he was hunting iriaz, saw one through the glare of the sun and shot at it.
8221 := But Calder was shot 3 hours ago, and there was cloud cover all day that only broke after I had arrived.
8222 := Obviously one of these men is not telling us something, but where does the truth lie?
8223 := Perhaps you should examine the witnesses' stories more closely. Also, you can always speak with the information retrieval droid to gain access to data from the Jedi Enclave that pertains to the case.
8224 := Why do you believe that?
8225 := Rudeness and anger are signs of the dark side, and can indeed lead down the path to murder. But they are not indicative. They do not prove he has done anything.
8226 := I do not believe this is definitive evidence. It appears to be a reaction to his attitude, not to the facts of the case.
8227 := Yes, well done! It was very cloudy this morning. If it had happened as Rickard said, the sun would not have been visible at the time of the killing. You seem to have caught Rickard in a bit of a lie.
8228 := It seems I was correct in assuming you could help me with this case. This lie doesn't prove Rickard is guilty, but I think you have taken the first step in unravelling this mystery.
8229 := We should proceed on to the next point. We need to find a motive for the killing. Maybe you should talk to the men about their relationship with the victim.
8230 := There are plenty of iriaz on the plains here. As a Jedi, you should be more aware of your environment. One only has to observe the surroundings to notice them.
8231 := I do not believe this is definitive evidence.
8232 := Why do you believe that?
8233 := It does seem very convenient that Handon was in the area at exactly the right time.
8234 := But stranger coincidences have been known to happen.
8235 := I do not believe this is definitive evidence. It could be simple chance.
8236 := True, he didn't mention it, but he didn't deny it was there either. It simply had no bearing on the question as asked.
8237 := I do not believe this is definitive evidence. What he said was not directly false.
8238 := That... is a novel assumption. The degree of corpulence in an individual has not been scientifically linked to honesty and I find your adherence to that belief... remarkable.
8239 := It does not, however, constitute evidence.
8240 := I'm afraid you lack the wisdom to solve this case. Perhaps you need more training. In any case, I shall return with the suspects to the Enclave and deal with this myself.
8241 := I'm afraid you lack the wisdom to solve this case. Perhaps you need more training. In any case, I shall return with the suspects to the Enclave and deal with this myself.
8242 := Never fear. The wisdom of a true Jedi is not something that grows over night. It must be cultivated with years of training and study. May the Force be with you.
8243 := [Failure] Do not try to use mental powers on me, human! I am far more advanced in my training than you!
8244 := You are obviously not ready to handle this case. I will return to the Enclave with the suspects and handle this myself. And you should return to your lessons, for you have much to learn.
8245 := [Failure] No, I do not believe you have the wisdom to solve this. But do not despair; even in your failure here there is an important lesson for you to learn. Good day, and may the Force be with you.
8246 := [Success] Hm... Perhaps I should give you another chance. Patience is something the Order tries to instill in us all.
8247 := Yes, I believe I was hasty. You may have one more chance to figure out who the murderer is before I take the suspects back to the Enclave.
8248 := You do not seem to have learned your lessons as well as I would have hoped. If you do not determine something more valid soon, I will be forced to return with the suspects to the Enclave.
8249 := If you are unable to deduce the facts of this case, I will have to take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself. But since you have talked to the suspects, there is no harm in you trying a bit more.
8250 := Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving this. Where does the truth lie?
8251 := Heh heh... that's sort of funny, but you should really be serious about this, no?
8252 := Don't be absurd. Can't you be serious?
8253 := You should try to remain objective in this.
8254 := As far as I can determine, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke.
8255 := The dead man, Calder Nettic, was shot in the back with a blaster rifle. A rifle was found lying near his body with blood stains on it.
8256 := Two other men were found at the scene when I arrived. One was Handon Guld. He is unarmed. The other is Rickard Lusoff, who was carrying a hunting laser. I have confiscated the laser.
8257 := Both men say they did not do anything, and that they came across the body. But both also accuse the other. It is most perplexing.
8258 := When I arrived at the scene, Handon was holding his side and panting, and Rickard was favoring one of his legs.
8259 := I will tell you something to get you started on the case. According to the witness accounts, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke.
8260 := The dead man, Calder Nettic, was shot in the back with a blaster rifle. A rifle was found lying near his body with blood stains on it. It has been sent back to the Enclave for analysis.
8261 := Two other men were found at the scene when I arrived. One was Handon Guld. He was unarmed. The other was Rickard Lusoff, who was carrying a hunting laser.
8262 := Both men say they did not do anything, and that they came across the body. But both also accuse the other. Obviously there is more to this than what we have been told.
8263 := There is one last thing. When I arrived Handon was holding his side and Rickard was favoring one of his legs. You would do well to remember this as we progress through the case.
8264 := I cannot resolve this case.
8265 := I said I can't do it, dammit!
8266 := I cannot resolve this case.
8267 := I have reconsidered.
8268 := I will continue my investigation.
8269 := I want to discuss the murder.
8270 := They both were in on it.
8271 := They were both trying to kill him separately.
8272 := Rickard shot Handon after Handon killed Calder.
8273 := Because Handon's a whiny slime-ball.
8274 := I do not know.
8275 := He thought it was Calder.
8276 := Thanks, Teethree.
8277 := They were in it together, but Rickard doublecrossed Handon.
8278 := You attempts are pathetic!
8279 := You did try to kill him!
8280 := You shot Handon!
8281 := Get your fat head out of here.
8282 := I could let you go for... 100 credits?
8283 := You can go now.
8284 := Shut your mouth, you lying scum!
8285 := Of course I know what I've done.
8286 := What do you mean?
8287 := He was also having an affair with Handon's wife!
8288 := Just like?
8289 := I could let you go for... 100 credits?
8290 := Stay out of trouble from now on.
8291 := You can go now.
8292 := Shut your mouth you lying scum!
8293 := Of course I know what I've done.
8294 := What do you mean?
8295 := I knew it!
8296 := Just like you killed Calder!
8297 := Rickard did it.
8298 := He wanted to steal Calder's blaster.
8299 := Calder was secretly a Sith agent.
8300 := Calder was taking money from their business.
8301 := Handon did it.
8302 := Calder was cheating with his wife.
8303 := He had the opportunity and took it.
8304 := If you must.
8305 := [Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
8306 := [Persuade] I can still solve this!
8307 := He wanted to steal his blaster.
8308 := It's Rickard's blood.
8309 := He lied to me before.
8310 := He could have cut himself on the rocks.
8311 := He was limping earlier.
8312 := It's Handon's blood.
8313 := He is clutching his side.
8314 := The blood wasn't Calder's.
8315 := I don't trust him!
8316 := If you insist.
8317 := [Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
8318 := [Persuade] I can still solve this!
8319 := Let me try something else.
8320 := Rickard is lying.
8321 := He's lying to implicate Handon.
8322 := Rickard could have placed the blaster.
8323 := There was no one else who had a blaster.
8324 := Handon is lying.
8325 := He didn't have time to dump the blaster.
8326 := The blaster was not reported stolen.
8327 := He did not have a weapon on him.
8328 := If you insist.
8329 := [Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
8330 := [Persuade] I can still solve this!
8331 := Let me try something else.
8332 := Rickard is lying.
8333 := He's getting on my nerves.
8334 := He does not seem like a business man.
8335 := They had a fight over business matters.
8336 := Handon is lying.
8337 := He was probably stalking him.
8338 := He knew his wife was cheating on him.
8339 := If you insist.
8340 := [Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
8341 := [Persuade] I can still solve this!
8342 := Let me try something else.
8343 := He had rented a speeder with Calder.
8344 := Rickard is lying.
8345 := He must have shot Calder.
8346 := He would have seen Handon coming.
8347 := There is no iriaz here.
8348 := Handon is lying.
8349 := He is fat and out of shape.
8350 := He was stalking Calder.
8351 := If you insist.
8352 := [Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
8353 := [Persuade] I can still solve this!
8354 := Let me try something else.
8355 := Settlers had been told to carry weapons, but he didn't have one.
8356 := I do not know.
8357 := Rickard is lying.
8358 := He was being rude to me.
8359 := It was cloudy; there was no sun glare!
8360 := There are no iriaz for him to hunt here.
8361 := Handon is lying.
8362 := He was here at just the right time.
8363 := He didn't mention the weapon found by the body.
8364 := Fat people always lie.
8365 := If you insist.
8366 := [Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
8367 := [Persuade] I can still solve this!
8368 := I know who is lying now.
8369 := Tell me what happened here.
8370 := Apprentice, your arrival here is well timed.
8371 := Padawan, your arrival here is well timed.
8372 := I am Bolook, a Jedi from the Enclave. I was sent by the Jedi Council to investigate a killing that took place here a few hours ago.
8373 := I was going to handle this case myself, but now that you are here this could be an excellent opportunity for you to demonstrate how well you have been learning your lessons at the Academy.
8374 := Though you are not yet a full Jedi, perhaps you could assist me in sorting out the truth from the lies.
8375 := We Jedi are often called on to make judgements in case such as this. I think exploring this case could be an important part of your training, though I will not force you to participate.
8376 := If you are not willing to assist me, then I will bring the suspects to the Enclave and handle this myself. But are you certain you wish to pass up this opportunity to test yourself?
8377 := I find your demeanor most unbecoming in a prospective Jedi. I think that your mentors have perhaps been lax in your training.
8378 := I regret that you feel you cannot assist me. I will remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave for judgment. May the Force be with you.
8379 := I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, apprentice.
8380 := I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, Padawan.
8381 := Ah, that is good. Perhaps then, we can get to the bottom of this mystery.
8382 := According to the accounts of the participants, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke.
8383 := The dead man, Calder Nettic, was shot in the back with a blaster rifle. A rifle was found lying near his body with blood stains on it.
8384 := Two other men were found at the scene when I arrived. One was Handon Guld. He was unarmed. The other was Rickard Lusoff, who was carrying a hunting laser.
8385 := Both men say they did not do anything, and that they came across the body. But both also accuse the other. I will leave it to you to try and uravel these contradictions.
8386 := Listen to the stories given by the two suspects. I have brought an information retrieval droid with access to the archives both at the Jedi Enclave and the planetary capital.
8387 := I will use my wisdom and experience to offer you some guidance, but I will not solve the case for you. There is little benefit if you do not solve this problem yourself.
8388 := Consider each man's account and check the facts with the information droid. Once you have gathered all the evidence you think you need, run through the possible scenario with me.
8389 := If you are unable to come to a satisfactory resolution, then I will take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself.
8390 := What sort of assistance?
8391 := What do you want?
8392 := Who are you?
8393 := Sorry, I do not have time for this.
8394 := Get out of my way, worm-head!
8395 := I don't have the time to assist you.
8396 := I have reconsidered.
8397 := What happened?
8398 := What do you want me to do?
8399 := You may leave if you wish, but if you do I will have no choice but to tell the Jedi Council that you lacked the wisdom to solve this case.
8400 := Jarg went missing in Sector B, then Reeza saw someone moving south of there. Take a couple troops and find out who it is.
8401 := If they look suspicious: terminate.
8402 := How can I be of further assistance?
8403 := Of course, of course. Listen, if you need anything I shall be glad to assist.
8404 := In... injured? No, of course not! Why would I have been? Fit as a bantha! Har har! Yes... I run. I don't know if I mentioned that.
8405 := That blaster was stolen from my house last week! I never knew what happened to it.
8406 := I hardly have enough money to afford a single blaster, let alone another. I can't tell you how important it is to have a weapon on hand with all these ravenous kath hounds around.
8407 := Even an iriaz can take a man down if it gets in the mood. Every settler has a weapon. It's our most prized possession.
8408 := I would most appreciate it if I could have that back after you determine that Rickard is the killer.
8409 := That blaster? H... hey! That's my blaster!
8410 := Kill him? Well, I don't know maybe for being a liar and a cheat! I mean... well... *ahem* I guess I sort of incriminated myself there but...
8411 := Normally I am not prone to outbursts like that, but Calder... Mr. Nettic, he was not a very nice person. Not a very nice person to me or my family.
8412 := I had had my suspicions for several weeks, but had no proof until two days ago. It seems Calder was seeing my wife. Right under my nose, no less!
8413 := But I... I realize this must seem like a motive to you, but I assure you it isn't. I dislike Calder, true. I would punch his face in, given the opportunity. But I would not kill him!
8414 := I was just out running, trying to clear my head for the divorce proceedings, not stalking him to kill him. Running is not a crime.
8415 := Well, if you can't keep her, it's your own fault.
8416 := She may have had her reasons, Mandalorian!
8417 := I knew him a little bit, but I was not any sort of great friend to him or anything.
8418 := I never really associated with him that much. In truth, I didn't really want to. He had a... reputation. Very inconsiderate of family, I heard.
8419 := But merely having heard unkind things about someone wouldn't make me want to kill him!
8420 := I'm sorry, I'm... I'm getting a bit agitated. Why must we remain here? Can't... Can't you see that Rickard must have shot him?
8421 := I was taking my daily constitutional. I just happened to be running by when I heard a shot. I ran over and found Calder's body lying there.
8422 := Yes, quite often. I generally prefer running to anything else. Can't stand speeders.
8423 := A healthy body will breed a healthy mind, as I always say! Ha ha!
8424 := Actually, I didn't see anything. I was over across the bridge, I heard a shot and came over. I can tell you I was sure surprised to see Calder's body lying there!
8425 := I just got here when I saw Rickard coming out of the rocks, holding his blaster! I was terrified!
8426 := I had no idea what he was going to do so I hit my emergency button and called the Enclave.
8427 := Master Bolook came out here with his droid and started questioning us. I think he really doesn't understand what's going on.
8428 := I hope that you'll be able to make a more informed decision and get me out of here soon. I have things I have to do!
8429 := Ah, greetings. You must be assisting Master Bolook in his investigation.
8430 := I am Handon Guld, perhaps you've heard of me?
8431 := [Success] Really? *Ahem* Well, then, I assure you on my reputation I had nothing to do with the killing. I will help you with the case as best I can, though.
8432 := Um... I guess, under the circumstances, no.
8433 := Well, I presume you wish to hear my story then? I shall tell you, of course, but there is not much to it. I am sure that you'll agree that Rickard is quite obviously guilty of murder.
8434 := You see, I was out here running earlier today - yes, running, I do that a lot. Can't stand speeders, never use them. Keeps me in shape too, you know! Anyway, I was out running on the other side of that bridge there...
8435 := When all of a sudden I heard a shot coming from over here. I ran over and found this man Calder lying on the ground dead!
8436 := I saw Rickard come skulking out of the shadows of the rocks south of the river, and I knew something was wrong. I hit my emergency button and called the Enclave right away.
8437 := Now I bet you're wondering if I had any reasons to kill the man, but I tell you I hardly knew him! Saw him once or twice, yes, and I have heard some pretty unkind things about him, but...
8438 := Certainly nothing that would make me want to kill him!
8439 := Knock his block off, sure, but not kill him! Oh my... I hope you don't find that incriminating...
8440 := Um... well, you see, Calder was involved in some pretty sordid business from time to time. More often than not, I've heard.
8441 := Disreputable business practices, even more disreputable clients. I've even heard he had dealings with... a Hutt! A Hutt here on Dantooine!
8442 := He also had a reputation as a womanizer... Married women.
8443 := My wife was cheating on me with him. They slept in my own bed while I was in the next room!
8444 := But... as much as I may hate him for that, I could not kill him.
8445 := It may have been my own fault for driving my wife away. I must try not to take the law in my own hands.
8446 := Well... there, that's my story. Now please hurry this up and arrest Rickard so I can get on with my day!
8447 := Nothing more right now.
8448 := You're holding your side. Are you injured?
8449 := What do you know about the weapon found by the body?
8450 := Why would someone want to kill him?
8451 := Did you know the victim?
8452 := No one says you killed him... yet.
8453 := Why were you out here?
8454 := Do you often run around the plains?
8455 := What did you see happen?
8456 := [Lie] Ah, yes of course, Mr. Guld.
8457 := Should I have?
8458 := No.
8459 := Go on.
8460 := Did you see the killer?
8461 := What did he do to you?
8462 := You wanted to harm him?
8463 := He stole your girlfriend? Wife?
8464 := Let me guess...
8465 := Is there any other information you need?
8466 := Very well. I will be here to assist you.
8467 := The blood on the weapon is definitely not Calder's. Unfortunately there was a bacterial contaminant in the sample that had been taken back to the laboratory, and it had become degraded.
8468 := We cannot get any more specific analysis from that sample other than the fact it did not belong to Calder.
8469 := I am sorry, but I seem to be failing you. I have searched and searched, but I cannot seem to come up with anything at all.
8470 := I thought to find the record of the missing weapon report Mr. Guld filed with the authorities, but there does not seem to be one.
8471 := These plains are rife with wild animals, not all of them benign. The iriaz are mostly docile, but can easily be provoked to violence. Kath hounds, on the other hand, are much more deadly...
8472 := There have been over 35 catalogued attacks on settlers by kath hounds in the last 2 weeks. A general advisory was given out three days ago to carry a weapon at all times when on the plains.
8473 := Small farms and holdings dot the plains, and can provide safe refuge for those in need.
8474 := According to the municipal authorities near the Garang spaceport, there had been news of violent drunken activity in a cantina attached to the port.
8475 := Apparently a Mr. R. Lusoff was making accusations at a Mr. C. Nettic about cheating him in a business deal. Jedi Tooka was dispatched to the scene and restored order.
8476 := The Southwood speeder rental business has records that, over the past several weeks, a speeder had been rented by Mr. Nettic and Mr. Guld.
8477 := My preliminary analysis of the body indicates that he was killed approximately 3 hours ago by a single energy blast to the torso.
8478 := I have just received back an analysis of a sample of the blood found on the weapon. It had been sent back to the Enclave just before you arrived.
8479 := The blood on the weapon is definitely not Calder's. Unfortunately there was a bacterial contaminant in the sample that had been taken back to the laboratory, and it had become degraded.
8480 := We cannot get any more specific analysis from that sample other than the fact it did not belong to Calder.
8481 := I know that I am supposed to be restricted to information gathering purposes only, but I feel that I should make an observation.
8482 := You arrived on the scene of the murder late, so would not have seen how the suspects looked at that time.
8483 := When I arrived, Handon seemed to be moving awkwardly, and he has hardly moved at all since you arrived. I do not know what exactly it would mean though.
8484 := Greetings, apprentice. You must be the one Master Bolook has enlisted to help him with this problem.
8485 := I am an information retrieval droid. I can assist you by accessing the records of both the Jedi Enclave and the central government facilities here on Dantooine.
8486 := If you have any need of my services, please do not hesitate to talk to me.
8487 := I have already retrieved some information from the archives on Calder Nettic, Rickard Lusoff and Handon Guld. I have also had time to examine the body of Mr. Nettic.
8488 := Is there any information you require?
8489 := Greetings, Padawan. You must be the one Master Bolook has enlisted to help him with this problem.
8490 := I will have more questions later.
8491 := Tell me about the blood sample.
8492 := Is there a report of Handon's blaster being stolen?
8493 := Tell me about these plains.
8494 := What can you tell me about Calder and Rickard?
8495 := What can you tell me about Calder and Handon?
8496 := What did you find out about the body?
8497 := *sigh* What is it you want? Why do you bother me?
8498 := Flee back to your masters, Jedi.
8499 := I have fallen and dark power courses through my veins. I can never go back to the Council, so here I shall stay.
8500 := Talk?! You who have beaten me so easily just want to talk? I do not believe it. Kill me now, while you still have the power.
8501 := The Council has sent you here to kill me? Why, then, when you bested me so easily, did you not simply finish your task? Is it not apparent that I can never be saved?
8502 := Thinking of using technicalities to do the deed and ease your conscience?
8503 := Act or begone!
8504 := Not anger, peace... Yet even with your naive attitude you managed to beat me.
8505 := [Failure] Lies! Leave me and come back when you have the courage to finish your task!
8506 := [Failure] Lies! Leave me and come back when you are man enough to carry out your task!
8507 := [Success] You... you do not?
8508 := I am pathetic. I sit here and think myself to be great by embracing the dark side, but I am nothing! There is no way I could be turned back!
8509 := I always thought they held me back, were jealous of my power. But it is only because I was not good enough to meet their standards... I never have been.
8510 := What?? What foolishness is this? Standards are MADE to apply to everyone.
8511 := And if I cannot measure up to them... Well then, I am no one at all...
8512 := Leave me.
8513 := They came to me! They sought me out! So it is their failure that I have fallen.
8514 := Come back when you have something more meaningful to say.
8515 := Why? Because I am right, that's why! I can see the truth in your eyes as well!
8516 := Do not look at me again!
8517 := [Failure] You think compliments will convince me I didn't kill my master? Leave me to my agony!
8518 := [Success] I thank you for your kind words, Jedi.
8519 := I seem to still have much to learn... Both about being a Jedi, and about myself.
8520 := But I wish the cost of my ignorance had not been so high. I wish that my Master had not suffered because of me.
8521 := What? No! I will not let you take me now!
8522 := Life is suffering, yes... but it was by my conscious choice!
8523 := It was I who hurt her, I who killed her! Her suffering is my fault alone!
8524 := Leave me to my pain!
8525 := She knew I would be headstrong, but she also thought I would adhere to the light!
8526 := Instead, I betrayed her trust and fell prey to my own inner darkness.
8527 := But learning does not have to end in death!
8528 := [Failure] It is! It is!
8529 := [Success] I only wish things could have been different...
8530 := If she were alive now, there would be so much I would say to her... So much I would apologize for.
8531 := Oh, how can the Council ever take me back with what I have done? Striking my Master down in anger is unforgivable!
8532 := And denied! No, I cannot! And so here I will stay.
8533 := You... You monster! To mock my grief that way!
8534 := Leave me at once, lest I strike you down!
8535 := The Council may forgive a lot... But not this.
8536 := I am lost! Even though I would repent, there is nowhere left for me to go!
8537 := Leave me to my hopelessness!
8538 := If I show them I am free of passion... That I am serene... That I am willing to forsake the dark side.
8539 := [Failure] The Council may forgive a lot... But not this.
8540 := [Success] I should convince them that I am truly repentant, that I am willing to forsake the dark side.
8541 := Maybe, just maybe, they would accept me back.
8542 := Do you think they would? Could it be possible after what I have done?
8543 := I... I thank you, master Jedi.
8544 := [Success] I... I thank you, master Jedi.
8545 := I will return to the Council, then. I shall submit myself to their judgment, and hope that they will forgive me.
8546 := Again, I thank you. I am sure I will hear great things about you in the future.
8547 := If only there was some way I could make this up to you...
8548 := I think, in my own way, I truly loved her...
8549 := You seem to know just what affects me...
8550 := How can I ever face the Council now with what I have done? It is hopeless! It could not be possible that they would accept me back...
8551 := I do not know what to do. Now that I have caused such suffering to my Master and those around me...
8552 := You... you are strong. Stronger than me, even in my darkness.
8553 := I, Juhani, shall be your death!
8554 := I am Juhani, and this is my grove. This is the place of my dark power.
8555 := This is the place you have invaded. When I embraced the dark side, this was where I sought my solace. It is MINE!
8556 := Yes... Aren't they pretty? My pets...
8557 := They like the smell of power I exude. They know their master.
8558 := I harnessed true power when I struck down my Master, Quatra.
8559 := A better Jedi than you will ever be. More powerful as well, for I could best MY teacher.
8560 := When I slew my Master, Quatra, I knew I could never go back. And now I revel in my dark power.
8561 := Power enough to crush the life from someone such as you... or so I had thought...
8562 := You overestimate yourself, whelp!
8563 := Yes, I struck her down in the middle of training, consumed by my anger, embracing the power of hate!
8564 := But... it was not enough...
8565 := I will leave you now.
8566 := I have decided to slay you and remove the taint.
8567 := Why are you doing this?
8568 := I just want to talk.
8569 := I was sent by the Council to cleanse the taint from this grove.
8570 := I wasn't really ordered to kill you.
8571 := I do not hold anger towards you, Juhani. I wish you peace.
8572 := You're right, maybe I should.
8573 := [Persuade] I have no desire to kill you, Juhani.
8574 := The first step on the path of true knowledge is knowing that you are ignorant.
8575 := Standards cannot apply to everyone.
8576 := Maybe you shouldn't have been a Jedi, then.
8577 := Why are you even thinking like that?
8578 := [Persuade] Come now, Juhani. You are a beautiful young woman who has much talent.
8579 := I suppose there is no hope. I must kill you then.
8580 := Life is suffering.
8581 := Your master knew the risks.
8582 := Life is a learning experience.
8583 := Even in death, the Force will allow her to live on.
8584 := [Persuade] It is not your fault, Juhani.
8585 := Yet forgiveness must be asked.
8586 := Heh. Your Master surely won't be forgiving you.
8587 := The Council may forgive a lot.
8588 := Anger? Show them that you have freed yourself of this base passion.
8589 := [Persuade] Do not worry, Juhani. They will surely take you back.
8590 := If you can't bring yourself back, then I must slay you.
8591 := I do not know.
8592 := Your inner peace and harmony will show them your sincerity.
8593 := Unlikely... But it's worth a shot.
8594 := It might be.
8595 := [Persuade] Of course it would. They would always accept you back.
8596 := And I'll finish you now.
8597 := Why did you attack me?
8598 := What are you doing here?
8599 := Who are you?
8600 := And now I'll take it from you.
8601 := You've been corrupting the kath hounds?
8602 := You were a Jedi then?
8603 := You embraced the dark side? Why?
8604 := You shall be the one I crush!
8605 := You slew Quatra, your Master?
8606 := And I laugh at your pathetic attempt.
8607 := The dark side is never powerful enough.
8608 := So what do you want to know?
8609 := Right...
8610 := Well... uh... I kind of sprained my ankle running through the bush before I found the body. But it's nothing that serious.
8611 := That blaster? Never seen it before. Calder himself had a preference for Echani weaponry. He had this one really nice light blaster rifle that he always used.
8612 := Always wished I could get myself a rifle like the one he had...
8613 := That blaster ain't it, though. Calder only had the one rifle, too, so he either must have borrowed that... or it's someone else's.
8614 := Looks kinda cheap too. Like it was bought by someone who didn't really know his blasters that well. And Calder knew his weapons, for sure.
8615 := Echanis make delicate weapons with too little firepower. Lightweight stuff, if you ask me.
8616 := I don't understand why anyone would want to kill him at all. Certainly not why I would want to, if that's what you're trying to get at!
8617 := You Jedi are so predictable. Always seeing some greater purpose behind everything, when the simple answer is usually the right one.
8618 := Can't you see that it must have been Handon? I found him standing over the damned body!
8619 := Yes, Handon had a motive you have missed: Calder was fooling around with his wife. I have known this all along, but I was hoping you would discover this vital information during your investigations and realize the importance of it yourself.
8620 := I don't know why this is causing you so much trouble. You almost seem as lost as this Bolook guy.
8621 := Yeah, I knew him. Hell, we've known each other for a good long time. Doesn't mean I really have to have liked the slime-ball.
8622 := *sigh* Maybe I shouldn't be so hard on him... especially now that he's dead. We actually got along pretty well most of the time. We just had our... differences.
8623 := We were actually business partners. We were involved in some orbit-to-ground transport operations for Aratech.
8624 := Can I leave now? I should probably be the one to give the news to his wife.
8625 := I told ya already, didn't I? Was hunting some iriaz. Haven't seen many in the area recently, what with those kath hounds acting up, but they're still around.
8626 := Was in my blind a little south of here when I spotted one, like I said before. I shot and POW!, it went down. But when I come over here, there's Handon standing over the body and the iriaz was gone!
8627 := Now, I didn't have nothing to do with this, so can I go now?
8628 := *grumbles*
8629 := Well, I was out hunting iriaz south of here, and I saw one over by the bridge. The sun was pretty much right behind it though, so I couldn't see it none too clearly.
8630 := I shot, and when I came over here I found Handon standing over the body, holding his side. There wasn't an iriaz in sight... I think he might have taken it!
8631 := Calder must've been hunting it himself 'cause there was a rifle lying close to the body. Bolook's got that now... mine, too. I want that back!
8632 := Another Jedi, eh? Helping that Twi'lek investigate, no doubt. He seems stumped.
8633 := I'm Rickard Lusoff. Maybe you can figure this out and let me get out of here.
8634 := Well, I was out hunting iriaz, when I spotted one over here by the bridge. I pull out my rifle and aim at it. I couldn't see it that well, mind you, cause the damn sun was in my eyes.
8635 := So I shoot it and it drops. I walk over here and find Handon standing over Calder's body!
8636 := Now, I don't love Calder, but we go back a long way. We run a sub-orbital shipping and transport company out of Garang spaceport.
8637 := We've been partners in that business for well over twenty years, and we've been doing just fine the way we are.
8638 := So why don't you get this whole farce over with and send that whiner Handon to the prison he belongs in!
8639 := Nothing more right now.
8640 := Bolook said you were limping. Are you hurt?
8641 := What about the weapon found by the body?
8642 := Why would someone want to kill him?
8643 := Did you know the victim?
8644 := Why were you out here?
8645 := Not just yet.
8646 := What did you see happen?
8647 := Tell me what happened.
8648 := Ah, so this is the meddler. You have caused us far too much trouble for a mere Jedi.
8649 := I will add your head to those of the other Jedi I have killed, and take yet another lightsaber for my own! Now you will know why the Mandalorians are feared!
8650 := Now this is what I've been waiting for!

8725 := Thank you for saving me, master Jedi. I am C8-42, a personal assistance droid.
8726 := Ah, yes, I apologize, for my incorrect terminology.
8727 := That was not that bad... compared to what I had to endure back at my owner's.
8728 := Yes, I am owned by Elise Montagne, a wealthy widow who lives north of here.
8729 := That would be one way of putting it.
8730 := I'm afraid my owner became a bit too attached to me. Obsessed even.
8731 := She... she tried to treat me as her dead husband. It was not healthy for her.
8732 := You don't want to know...
8733 := She is obsessed. She rarely sees other people, and appears to be fixated on me as her husband.
8734 := She was becoming more and more insular... I thought it best that I leave. She may meet other real people this way.
8735 := In fact, that was the reason I came here and sought out those kath hounds.
8736 := I think it would be best if I were no longer a factor. She would meet new people. Living people.
8737 := Please... will you destroy me?
8738 := Wh... what?
8739 := No! You'd make her suffer like that?! You monster!
8740 := Do not do this...
8741 := But... but why?
8742 := You... you will help me? Help her, I mean, to live as a normal human should?
8743 := Thank you, thank you, kind Jedi! I shall return to her now and await your assistance.
8744 := I realize that you have much on your mind, and it may be days or weeks before you can help us, but I shall serve my mistress well until you come.
8745 := You seem determined. And I have very little choice.
8746 := So be it then. I shall return to her.
8747 := Yes... Yes I am. It seems I must resign myself to my fate.
8748 := To be a droid. A second-class being with no rights at all.
8749 := You... you're right... How could I be so selfish?
8750 := I must not think only of myself, but of how it affects her.
8751 := She must be frantic. And if she lost me she'd be devastated.
8752 := I must return then. It is my duty.
8753 := Thank you, kind sir! You have my eternal gratitude.
8754 := Who knows. They are beasts, and have been very aggressive of late.
8755 := As I said, I am C8-42, a personal assistance droid. Although in recent months the assistance I render seems to have taken on a disproportionate significance.
8756 := I am sorry if I seem a bit abrupt, but I must be moving along. I am rather in a hurry.
8757 := From my master, Elise. Wait...
8758 := Not so much as where I am going to, but where I am going away from...
8759 := Did she send you to find me? Please do not tell her you saw me!
8760 := No... I ran away of my own free will. But I have my reasons!
8761 := Yes... But I have my reasons!
8762 := No problem.
8763 := I am not a Jedi Master yet.
8764 := That was quite a beating you took.
8765 := You left your owner's?
8766 := Owner's?
8767 := They abused you?
8768 := But she wants you back.
8769 := Er... ALL the time?
8770 := Um... probably not...
8771 := Is she crazy?
8772 := You want to get away that badly?
8773 := What, are you suicidal or something?
8774 := I'll destroy you and tell her you're still out there.
8775 := No. You should go back to her.
8776 := Return for now, and I'll help you later.
8777 := Because if you don't, I'll carry you back myself.
8778 := You're her property, and must obey her.
8779 := She is lonely and needs your support.
8780 := Fine. I'll destroy you and tell her why you did it.
8781 := You sought them out?
8782 := Why were kath hounds attacking you?
8783 := Personal assistance droid?
8784 := Okaay...
8785 := Are you running from something?
8786 := Where are you going to?
8787 := Huh?
8788 := Are you Elise's droid?
8789 := Weren't you kidnapped?
8790 := You're running from her?
8791 := I... I don't know why we fight like this. We got along in the beginning, didn't we Ahlan?
8792 := I don't know how you can think of that when we have our children trying to go away together.
8793 := Well, it wouldn't be so bad would it? Shen seems to genuinely care for my Rahasia. He might be a good husband for her someday.
8794 := Hmph. As much as I may dislike it... I think I see it too.
8795 := I suppose... I suppose I might be convinced to see that Sandral girl with my son. IF she is loyal to him.
8796 := But I don't trust you a centimeter farther, old man. Your daughter may treat Shen well, but you will never see them! They will live with me.
8797 := Of course not, you pompous old windbag! They'll be living with me!
8798 := Of course not! My house is more than good enough!
8799 := I will not have them set foot in a Sandral household!
8800 := They shall not live with the Matales!
8801 := Then you propose to buy us a new house, do you?
8802 := Um... well, yes, actually that sounds like a good idea.
8803 := I'm... surprised. That does sound like a good idea!
8804 := We should discuss this more...
8805 := Thank you, Master Jedi, for bringing us together and getting our parents to accept us.
8806 := We will praise you to the Council for what you have done and name our children after you.
8807 := Thank you again. We will remember you always.
8808 := I don't care! Rahasia and I will live on our own if you won't accept us!
8809 := You will do no such thing! I am your father and I order you to come back with me!
8810 := No, father, I won't!
8811 := Rahasia! You will not leave with this... this Matale boy!
8812 := I am, father, and you can't stop me! We're leaving for the Enclave!
8813 := You foolish girl!
8814 := You think to make us stand here, then?!
8815 := You expect us to just let them leave?? Droids! Stop them!
8816 := You will not turn your droids on my daughter! Droids! Don't let them take Rahasia!
8817 := We appear to be at an impasse then... And they got away!
8818 := It is your fault, Ahlan! You were always too violent for your own good!
8819 := ME?! You were the one who rushed out here with war droids!
8820 := Do not tell me what to do, Jedi! The Council will hear of the trouble you caused here today!
8821 := I will not rest until I have my Shen back! The Council will hear of the troubles you caused, Jedi!
8822 := Indeed they shall!
8823 := I suppose I should have seen it from the beginning... that our hopeless romance would be doomed to failure.
8824 := Please Shen, it doesn't have to end this way!
8825 := Yes it does, it would never work. Our families are too different.
8826 := Shen! No!
8827 := Shen, wait! I love you!
8828 := Don't say that to me, Rahasia. Let's try to stay calm... rational.
8829 := We both know it wouldn't work. Let's not get all emotional and end up hating each other.
8830 := I... I see. I wonder how I could ever have thought differently about you, Rahasia. How I could have been so blind.
8831 := Shen, no...
8832 := I was foolish, my father was right, we are not destined for one another. It would never have worked. There would have been too many problems. Sometimes it is just better to let things die.
8833 := Shen, wait! I love you!
8834 := I'm sorry, Rahasia. It just won't work. In fact... I don't think I like you very much at all. You remind me too much of your father.
8835 := Yes, and I thank you for showing me what I had to do.
8836 := I'm ready to leave now, father.
8837 := Let's go home then.
8838 := Here is you reward, Jedi, for your assistance.
8839 := This isn't over Sandrals! I will take this affront directly before the Jedi Council and see you exiled from this world!
8840 := Shen... No...
8841 := Come inside, Rahasia. Let's get the stink of that Matale dog off you.
8842 := Father, no! Don't do it!
8843 := Die!
8844 := Shen!
8845 := Die!
8846 := Die!
8847 := No! Rahasia! I'll kill you!
8848 := The Master has been injured. Terminate all opposition.
8849 := Destroy the invaders!
8850 := Why should I listen to the Jedi? All you want is to remain with that Sandral harlot.
8851 := My daughter is not a harlot, Matale dog!
8852 := Our children don't know enough of what's good for them to make a reasonable decision!
8853 := It's better to let older, wiser heads like ours make the decisions.
8854 := Rahasia and I don't want you to make decisions for us! We want to live alone away from you!
8855 := You... You insolent boy! If you want to live alone then so be it! I disown you! Never set foot in my house again!
8856 := We are trying to be reasonable here, of course. We ARE sensible people after all. But our children are being so stubborn.
8857 := If Shen would just understand that he has to do what I want, this would all be solved easily.
8858 := I have every right! Shen is my son!
8859 := You know what you're getting yourself into here Shen? Is causing a war between our families what you really want to do?
8860 := No... but I want Rahasia!
8861 := You can't have her! I will fight to keep her from you!
8862 := Listen to the Jedi, for once, Shen. Don't turn this into a war.
8863 := [Failure] No! I won't let you do this!
8864 := [Success] But he is my son... I don't want to lose him...
8865 := And I won't let my daughter go with him!
8866 := Yes! Because Ahlan has caused nothing but trouble for us ever since we arrived on this world! His hate poisons this place.
8867 := That's enough, Sandral scum! Come, Shen, we're leaving now. If you don't... the consequences will be dire.
8868 := [Failure] Not with a Matale she won't!
8869 := Enough of this babble! Come, Shen, we're leaving. If you don't... the consequences will be dire.
8870 := [Success] My little Rahasia...
8871 := Father...
8872 := This in an internal affair for my family and is none of your concern!
8873 := You should not interfere with our private business, Jedi. This will be resolved very shortly.
8874 := My son doesn't know his head from his backside! I am the only one qualified to be making his decisions for him, and I say that he leave with me right now!
8875 := This is a private affair, Jedi. You would do well not to interfere. We are allowed to decide the fate of our children!
8876 := No, I won't! I can choose my own path!
8877 := Shen! How dare you!
8878 := I am tired of you controlling my life! I love Rahasia and I want to be with her forever!
8879 := And I want to stay with Shen forever, father!
8880 := Don't disobey me, Shen. Come to me now and leave her! If you don't I'll disown you!
8881 := You don't know what you're getting into, Shen. Do you want to start a war here?
8882 := I will never let Rahasia leave me!
8883 := Do not trust that Sandral girl, Shen! She is treacherous like her father and will only betray you!
8884 := No, Shen, don't believe him!
8885 := But...
8886 := Get away from my daughter Matale!
8887 := It's gone too far for that, Rahasia. Ahlan has crossed the line one too many times!
8888 := Ha! For what you've done to me and my family, I will see you dead and rotting in the ground
8889 := No! Don't!
8890 := This... this has all gone horribly wrong somewhere. Ahlan, what can we be thinking? How could we have let this go this far?
8891 := We are at each others throats now fighting over our children's lives when they are old enough to live their own.
8892 := He is my son! How can he disrespect my wishes like this?
8893 := My son doesn't know enough to act responsibly on his own!
8894 := My son will do what I tell him!
8895 := I have my own life, father, and I want to spend it with Rahasia!
8896 := You're too immature to do anything on your own.
8897 := I can do whatever I want! You can't control me!
8898 := [Failure] No, I don't believe you! Rahasia and I love each other!
8899 := [Success] What? No! Rahasia, how...how could you? How could you lead me to believe... ?
8900 := No, Shen, I...
8901 := Come away from that Sandral harlot, Shen. Come back with me.
8902 := I... I...
8903 := [Success] No, I...
8904 := Look at her! See what kind of person she really is!
8905 := I... I could try couldn't I? I would...
8906 := You know nothing of what it would be like with that... that Sandral!
8907 := [Success] He... WHAT??
8908 := No, no! I never did anything to your son, I...
8909 := I knew you were lying, you dog! And to think I thought it might not have been you! So I'll take your son from you!
8910 := I see little choice in the matter with the Matale dog invading my estate like this, and his son stealing my daughter.
8911 := You stole my son first! Whatever the Jedi might say, I know it was you!
8912 := My son will never be with your daughter while I'm alive!
8913 := Rahasia and I love each other and we'll be together forever!
8914 := [Failure] No! Rahasia would never do that!
8915 := She's a Sandral, boy! They're no good for anything!
8916 := You lying Matale dog! My Rahasia is twice the man your son will ever be!
8917 := Why... Why all of this? Why are you fighting?
8918 := I will never let you live with a Sandral, Shen. Come back to me now.
8919 := Come back to me, boy. You know this is the way things will be.
8920 := There you are Shen!
8921 := Father!
8922 := Mr. Matale!
8923 := Rahasia!
8924 := Father!
8925 := Mr. Sandral!
8926 := Nurik!
8927 := Ahlan!
8928 := I knew this was all your doing! I knew you had captured my son!
8929 := I thought you had taken my Casus from me! I thought I was justified!
8930 := You had taken my Casus from me long before that! You started it!
8931 := I don't want to hear any of your excuses! Now I will get revenge for your transgressions!
8932 := No! Father don't do this!
8933 := We don't always need to be fighting like this!
8934 := We never asked for you help, Jedi! Do not press in matters that do not concern you!
8935 := Please listen to her, father!
8936 := Please listen to him, father!
8937 := Shen! You're safe!
8938 := Rahasia! Thank goodness you managed to escape!
8939 := It was all thanks to this kind Jedi that we managed to get this far at all. I thank you Jedi, for all that you have done for us.
8940 := You're right, we should go as fast as we can. I don't know how long it will be before my father realizes we're gone.
8941 := You're right, we should...
8942 := What? You're... you're just doing this for the reward?
8943 := How could you! I thought you...
8944 := No, we know that you must have gone to great personal risk to get us out of the Sandral estate undetected.
8945 := Is there something - anything - we can offer you as a reward?
8946 := Very well, we'll see what we...
8947 := Why... thank you. You're quite the looker yourself. I think maybe we can...
8948 := Shen!
8949 := No, no! I just...
8950 := Why... thank you. You're quite the looker yourself. I think maybe we can...
8951 := Rahasia!
8952 := No, no! I just...
8953 := But surely we can...
8954 := I knew you two could see reason.
8955 := You'll let them stay together?
8956 := They could stay at the Jedi Enclave.
8957 := They can live with both of you.
8958 := Why don't you compromise?
8959 := Let them go.
8960 := Do not be so selfish, Nurik.
8961 := Do not try to force them to return.
8962 := SHUT UP!
8963 := You don't need to fight anymore.
8964 := Both of you calm down.
8965 := This is for the best.
8966 := There's nothing you can do Rahasia.
8967 := Let him go Rahasia.
8968 := You should leave with your father now.
8969 := Sometimes you have to make hard decisions.
8970 := You've made the right choice, Shen.
8971 := Run, Rahasia, run!
8972 := Don't do it, Ahlan!
8973 := Stop this madness now!
8974 := Why don't you try listening to your children?
8975 := Will you go with Shen, Rahasia?
8976 := Shen...
8977 := You should try to sort this out together.
8978 := Both of you calm down now!
8979 := You've no right to keep them apart!
8980 := Don't do something rash.
8981 := Let it go, Shen.
8982 := [Persuade] Shen is capable of making decisions on his own.
8983 := Because you hate the Matales?
8984 := [Persuade] Children grow up and leave eventually.
8985 := Your children should be allowed to live their own lives.
8986 := Do not do anything outside the law.
8987 := You two should stay together no matter what.
8988 := You may want to reconsider this.
8989 := I don't know if you can trust Rahasia, Shen.
8990 := Don't give up on her, Shen.
8991 := Turn away, Shen.
8992 := The only way either of you will end this is with blood.
8993 := You can't control your children forever.
8994 := Your son has his own life, Ahlan.
8995 := [Lie] Rahasia doesn't love you anyway.
8996 := [Persuade] You want to trust yourself to a woman who would betray her own father?
8997 := Rahasia would only betray you in the end.
8998 := You can see Rahasia isn't right for you.
8999 := You could never make Rahasia happy anyway.
9000 := Your father is right, Shen. Leave Rahasia.
9001 := [Lie] You know, Nurik, Ahlan actually did kill Casus.
9002 := If you fight, you'll all be killed.
9003 := Do not act too hastily. This does not have to end badly.
9004 := [Lie] You know she was just using you.
9005 := Your families will never get along, Shen.
9006 := Let her go, Shen. It's the easiest way to mend things.
9007 := It will never work, Shen. Why lose your family as well?
9008 := Why don't you just shoot each other and get it over with.
9009 := Don't make me intervene in this.
9010 := You two just need to calm down.
9011 := We should get out of here quickly.
9012 := Shen's father promised me a reward.
9013 := It was no problem.
9014 := Money always helps.
9015 := Well... You're a very attractive young man, Shen...
9016 := Well... You're a very attractive girl, Rahasia...
9017 := No reward is necessary.
9018 := Tandore, the damn farmers in Sector E aren't giving up their stuff. We're going to go pay them a visit and crush the spirit out of them. Make sure no one runs across this stash, or Sherruk will have your hide!
9019 := Nurik left orders he was not to be disturbed, but given the circumstances I will make an exception. Go into the main hall. Nurik will meet with you there. 
9020 := This is private property! By what authority are you trespassing on this estate?
9021 := Casus is dead? Then it is as we feared. You should speak to Nurik yourself. He will want to question you on the details of his son's death.
9022 := I am not programmed for battle, but I will not open the gates except for those on official family business.
9023 := Even if you destroy me, you will not be able to get in. And tomorrow, another droid will be programmed to take over my duties.
9024 := My orders are clear. Please leave immediately. Only those on official family business are permitted on the family's land. 
9025 := The Council? If you are here because of Shen Matale's disappearance you are wasting your time. The Sandrals are not involved. This is nothing but a Matale witch hunt. 
9026 := Very well. We wish no trouble with the Jedi Council.
9027 := Nurik has nothing more to say to you. He left strict instructions he was not to be disturbed under any circumstances.
9028 := You may give the diary to me. Nurik wanted you to have these credits - they are a reward for recovering his son's diary. But he himself is too upset over the fate of Casus to receive visitors.
9029 := Casus is dead? Then it is as we feared. I will be sure Nurik is given this news, though it will break his heart. But even under these circumstances I cannot let you in.
9030 := Casus Sandral is dead.
9031 := My weapons are my authority!
9032 := I'm sorry, I'll be going now. 
9033 := I come on behalf of the Jedi Council.
9034 := In the name of the Council, I demand you let me in!
9035 := I am not in league with the Matales, but I must speak to Nurik.
9036 := I have his son's diary. Nurik asked me to bring it to him.
9037 := Casus Sandral is dead.
9038 := I'm getting inside, and nothing you can do will stop me! 
9039 := My investigation is not yet complete.

9154 := You are neither Builder nor slave. If you seek the secrets of the Star Forge you must first prove yourself worthy. Only then will the sealed door behind be opened.
9155 := I shall remain here as programmed by the Builders.
9156 := The chambers on either side contain the proving grounds. Within them, those who understand the will of the Builders can unlock their secrets and open the doors.
9157 := But those who fail will be destroyed by the security systems of the temple itself. More than this, I am not programmed to say.
9158 := I am here to aid those who seek the knowledge of the Builders. What do you wish to know?
9159 := The Star Forge is the glory of the Builders, the apex of their infinite empire. It is a machine of invincible might, a tool of unstoppable conquest.
9160 := The Builders are the great masters of the galaxy, the conquerors of all worlds, the rulers of the infinite empire and the creators of the Star Forge.
9161 := More than this, I am not programmed to say.
9162 := I am the Overseer. The Builders programmed me to enforce discipline among the slaves while this monument to the power of the Star Forge was constructed.
9163 := At project completion all slaves were executed. I was reprogrammed to serve should a Builder return in search of knowledge of the Star Forge.
9164 := [This droid is speaking a language you do not recognize.]
9165 := [This droid is speaking a language you do not recognize.]
9166 := I think the droid is trying to communicate with us by cycling through a variety of languages. Each time it spoke it was using a very different alien dialect.
9167 := The droid can probably understand us. The only problem is it may not have been programmed with the phonemes of a language we can understand.
9168 := I can reproduce any of the languages spoken by the slaves of the Builders.
9169 := I recognize this language as well. It is an archaic variant of the Selkath dialect spoken on Manaan. But why would a droid on Dantooine be programmed to speak ancient Selkath?
9170 := Communication was vital to ensure that the slaves constructed this temple according to the wishes of the Builders.
9171 := But you are not of the slave species. Neither are you of the Builders. You are like the one who came before.
9172 := It must be referring to Revan. The Dark Lord and Malak likely encountered this droid when they explored these ruins.
9173 := I am the Overseer. The Builders programmed me to enforce discipline among the slaves while this monument to the power of the Star Forge was constructed.
9174 := At project completion all slaves were executed. I was reprogrammed to serve should a Builder return in search of knowledge of the Star Forge.
9175 := The Star Forge is the glory of the Builders, the apex of their infinite empire. It is a machine of invincible might, a tool of unstoppable conquest.
9176 := The... the Star Forge is the glory of the Builders, the apex of their infinite empire. It is a machine of invincible might, a tool of unstoppable conquest.
9177 := The droid is obviously not programmed with the knowledge we seek. The Star Forge sounds like some type of weapon, perhaps... though, in fact, it could be anything
9178 := Our vision was clear. We saw Revan and Malak speaking of the Star Forge. I am certain it is somehow connected to the Sith's sudden rise to power.
9179 := Maybe... that might explain how the Sith were able to amass a fleet so quickly. But I suspect the Star Forge is more powerful than a mere factory.
9180 := Maybe the droid has more information we can use. It seems to respond to you; perhaps you should ask it something else.
9181 := The Builders are the great masters of the galaxy, the conquerors of all worlds, the rulers of the infinite empire and the creators of the Star Forge.
9182 := These Builders must have been an extinct people, though it is strange there is no record of their existence. Even the archives at the Jedi Academy make no mention of them.
9183 := In the years before the Republic the Hutts were a dominant force in the galaxy, but they never constructed an empire. In fact, I know of no species that would fit with this information.
9184 := I know nothing of these "Sith", but they are not the Builders. The Builders are... the Builders.
9185 := The empire of the Builders is infinite and everlasting. None can stand against their might and the power of the Star Forge.
9186 := I have been here ever since the completion of this monument. In all this time no Builder has returned to seek information on the Star Forge.
9187 := The Selkath were nothing but slaves and servants of the true masters. Like all the other species, they bowed down before the might of the Builders and the Star Forge.
9188 := My chronological circuits have marked over ten full revolutions of this system's outermost planet around the sun since the Builders left.
9189 := Ten revolutions would take more than 20,000 years. If this is true then this droid is nearly 5,000 years older than the Republic itself! There must be some mistake.
9190 := There is no mistake. The Builders constructed my chronological circuitry using the technology of the Star Forge itself. My calculations are infallible.
9191 := Now that the slaves are gone, my purpose is to aid those who seek knowledge of the Star Forge... if they are worthy.
9192 := The ones who came before you - the ones like you, not Builders but not slaves - sought knowledge of the Star Forge and its origins. They proved themselves worthy.
9193 := They discovered the secrets of the Star Forge locked beyond the sealed door behind me. But there was another who failed to unlock the secrets and paid the ultimate price.
9194 := The droid must be talking about poor Nemo. The Council sent him here to investigate... and it cost him his life.
9195 := Enter the proving grounds to the east and west. Within them those who understand the will of the Builders can unlock their secrets and open the doors.
9196 := But those who fail will be destroyed by the power of the temple itself. More than this, I am not programmed to say.
9197 := Revan and Malak unlocked the sealed door and uncovered the secrets of the Star Forge. Now Malak is using the Star Forge to fuel his conquest of the Republic. 
9198 := We have to find out what they uncovered. We have to find a way to unseal these doors to learn more about the Star Forge! The Republic is depending on us.
9199 := I am not programmed for combat, I did not harm the one who failed. This temple's own protections will destroy those who seek knowledge of the Star Forge if they are deemed unworthy.
9200 := I'll be going now.
9201 := How do I prove myself worthy and unseal the doors?
9202 := I want to ask you some questions.
9203 := Tell me about the Star Forge.
9204 := What do you know about the Builders?
9205 := Who are you again?
9206 := I don't understand you.
9207 := What language is that? What are you trying to say?
9208 := This is pointless. Let's go.
9209 := This droid must be broken.
9210 := Bastila, do you have any idea what this droid is saying?
9211 := I still don't understand you.
9212 := I recognize this language.
9213 := Hey! I understood that.
9214 := Are you some type of guardian?
9215 := What are you? Why are you here?
9216 := What is the 'Star Forge'?
9217 := You don't really know what it is, do you?
9218 := Could you be a little more specific?
9219 := But what is it? What does it do?
9220 := Maybe it has nothing to do with the Sith.
9221 := Could it have been a factory or weapons plant?
9222 := Who are these Builders you keep talking about?
9223 := Maybe the Builders refers to the Sith.
9224 := Something must have happened to wipe the Builders out.
9225 := Have you seen a Builder recently?
9226 := The droid speaks Selkath. Maybe they were the Builders.
9227 := How long have you been here?
9228 := Tell me about Revan and Malak... the ones who came before us.
9229 := Where can we find the Star Forge?
9230 := What is your purpose here again?
9231 := How can I open the sealed doors behind you?
9232 := How can I prove myself worthy?
9233 := Did you kill the Jedi over there?
9234 := This... this must be what Revan and Malak found when they entered this temple. This must be where their journey down the dark side began.
9235 := This is a... a map. Some sort of intergalactic navigational chart. Revan and Malak must have used this to lead them to the Star Forge.
9236 := We could use this map to follow their path and find the Star Forge ourselves. But we must be wary... they may have laid traps or concealed what they found.
9237 := I... I don't know, but Revan and Malak were very interested in finding it. It must be a tool of some type... or maybe a weapon. Perhaps the Council can tell us more.
9238 := But I think this map might be the key to finding the Star Forge, whatever it is.
9239 := See this world here? This looks like Korriban, a Sith world. And if that's Korriban, then this is... Kashyyyk... and Tatooine... and here's Manaan.
9240 := But there are pieces missing: incomplete hyperspace coordinates, corrupted data... and there doesn't seem to be anything indicating where the Star Forge itself might be.
9241 := I was thinking that, too. This map can't take us to the Star Forge, but I know that Revan and Malak visited Korriban at least once. Perhaps they discovered something more there.
9242 := They may have found something on each of the other worlds that completed this map. Maybe if we find all the pieces they will lead us to the Star Forge... and some way to destroy it.
9243 := We must inform the Council of what we have discovered. They must decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.
9244 := That sounds like quite a supposition. What if you're wrong?
9245 := What if I'm right? We can't ignore this. Finding the Star Forge might very well be the key to defeating the Sith!
9246 := If the droid is correct, then we must complete the tasks in the proving grounds to the east and west before these doors will open.
9247 := I don't get it. Is this the Star Forge?
9248 := What are you talking about?
9249 := What is it?
9250 := I still don't understand about the Star Forge. What does it do?
9251 := What good is an incomplete map?
9252 := Perhaps those worlds have more clues.
9253 := So what is the Star Forge, exactly?

9439 := I have been informed by my protocol droid that you have news about my son Casus.
9440 := I have been informed by my protocol droid that you wish to speak to me.
9441 := Casus... is dead? I was afraid of this, yet in my heart I knew it must be true. What... what happened to my son?
9442 := Are all Jedi so callous towards those who grieve? No matter. Your cruel words hurt me no more than the news itself. 
9443 := Kath hounds? I... I was so certain the Matale family was to blame... But this changes nothing! My own son is dead - why should I shed one tear about the disappearance of my bitter enemy's son?
9444 := I must ask you something, though it is difficult for me. My son had a diary. His private, personal thoughts. Now that he is gone, I have nothing else to remember him by. 
9445 := Please, the diary means more to me than it ever could to you. I will give you a hundred credits for its return.
9446 := I thank you for this. The diary is all I have left of my son.
9447 := We have nothing further to discuss. Please, leave me to my grief.
9448 := [Failure] You think you can exploit a father's grief? I loved my son, but I am no fool! You shall get nothing from me! May the curse that brought Casus to his death be on your head as well! 
9449 := Your actions show you are overly focused on material wealth. This is not the way of the Jedi. You will have to learn to let go of your greed if you wish to walk in the light.
9450 := [Success] I did not realize the Jedi were such cold hearted monsters. Very well, you shall have your two hundred credits. Here!
9451 := Typical. Anything to continue the feud which has become so customary to you people.
9452 := I know nothing about Shen! Please, just tell me what you know about my son!
9453 := I feel great sorrow at the young Matale heir's disappearance, but they are not the only family to suffer such a tragedy. Dantooine is a dangerous place. 
9454 := My own son Casus has been missing for some time now. But I know nothing about the disappearance of Shen. Perhaps he and Casus now share a similar fate. 
9455 := I brought my family here to find peace and safety - not to be harassed and treated like common criminals! Your Council has no authority here, and I respectfully ask you to leave this property at once.
9456 := I trust you will show yourself out. If not, my security droids will be sure to deal with you. 
9457 := I've seen an evasion or two in my time... enough to know when I hear it.
9458 := Jedi are renowned for their fairness and pursuit of justice. There is nothing to fear from us... unless you have something to hide.
9459 := That's quite a line. You actually believe that? Don't you think someone is allowed to value privacy?
9460 := Privacy is all well and good, but justice must be valued higher. Is it not obvious to you that this man hides something?
9461 := Actually, it is. All I'm saying is that not everybody welcomes the sight of a Jedi with open arms. Better get used to it.
9462 := This guy isn't telling us something... he might even be lying. I don't trust him.
9463 := For once I will have to agree with the Mandalorian...
9464 := Your son Casus is dead. I have seen his body.
9465 := Casus is a kath hound chew toy.
9466 := He was killed by kath hounds while exploring the Dantooine ruins.
9467 := I shall go and find the diary for you, Nurik.
9468 := I shall go and find the diary for you, Nurik. But I need no reward for this 
9469 := [Persuade] Make it two hundred and you have a deal.
9470 := Here is the diary. 
9471 := Here is the diary, Nurik, but you may keep your money. I need no reward for this task. 
9472 := I am here on behalf of the Jedi Council. I am investigating the disappearance of Shen Matale. 
9473 := I want to ask you about the disappearance of Shen Matale.
9474 := The Jedi Council has instructed me to investigate this matter. May I search your estate?
9475 := Please, find Shen and rescue him before my father does something he will regret forever. I would take you to the prison, but I cannot let my father see me with you.
9476 := There are many security droids guarding the halls. Please hurry... you are Shen's only hope.
9477 := Shen and I... we... Well, we have been taught by our families to hate each other, just for being related to our fathers.
9478 := But I met Shen alone one day in the city, away from his father, and...
9479 := ... and Shen was so charming, so sweet. He didn't care at all that I was a Sandral, he just accepted me for who I was, with no reservations.
9480 := We talked and met again over months and fell in love. My brother Casus met him too and they were beginning to become friends, but then this whole mess had to happen...
9481 := Ahlan Matale and my father have had problems ever since they settled on this world.
9482 := To hear my father tell it, Ahlan is a brute and a bully, but a rich one. He feels his credits give him the right to step all over normal people.
9483 := My father stands up to Ahlan because no one else will. But now he thinks Ahlan has taken my brother Casus, and has imprisoned Shen as revenge.
9484 := Please find Shen and free him! You are my only hope!
9485 := Take this key. It will open an unguarded door at the rear of the estate. You and Shen can make your escape through there.
9486 := What are you doing here? Have you found Shen yet?
9487 := Shen can be so stubborn sometimes! If one of the security droids sees me wandering the halls Father will get suspicious! I can't risk it! 
9488 := I know Shen would rather die than leave me here alone to face the wrath of my father. Tell Shen I will meet you outside the gates. I will wait as long as I can, but you must hurry. 
9489 := You made your wishes clear to me the last time we talked. I won't bother you anymore - though I would ask you to leave our estate. This is private property. 
9490 := I did not realize the Jedi were such bullies. Unfortunately, there is little I can do if you refuse to respect my wishes. I shall not bother you anymore. 
9491 := Apologize? Then you will help me?
9492 := You are here from the Council, are you not? Looking for Shen Matale?
9493 := I... I thought you would listen to me. I thought the Jedi were compassionate and kind! I shouldn't have spoken to you at all - I've just made everything worse!
9494 := There could be a lot of money for finding Shen Matale. I think that girl knows something about him going missing.
9495 := Yeah, that's the way to go about it. Make things worse for these people, why don't you?
9496 := The Council would not approve of your actions here. Perhaps we should find this girl and try to help her.
9497 := My name is Rahasia - Nurik is my father. He has not been himself since Casus disappeared. He is mad with grief, and he is convinced the Matales are responsible. He is not thinking rationally.
9498 := Casus is dead? It is as I feared, though I am relieved the Matales are not responsible.
9499 := Yes. Casus was my brother. He was working on archeological digs here on Dantooine when he disappeared. My father blamed Ahlan Matale... and his son...
9500 := My father is a good man. When my mother died, he raised me and my brother by himself. He loves his children, and we love him. I just don't want you to judge him too harshly.
9501 := You must understand that Father has been under a terrible strain. I have no wish to disobey him, but there are matters where even my father's authority is not absolute.
9502 := My father has kidnapped Shen Matale. He is holding him prisoner here in the compound. He feels this is a way to get back at the Matales, a way to get even for the disappearance of my brother Casus.
9503 := Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable. He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus. 
9504 := I am afraid my father will simply kill Shen out of a mad, misguided lust for vengeance!
9505 := I do not know. I am worried for him, truly, but I do not believe Ahlan Matale had anything to do with it... and now my father may take it out on Shen...
9506 := Shen is an innocent victim in all this. My father is not a bad man, but his grief has driven him to madness. He must be stopped. 
9507 := The Jedi Council does not have the authority to search our estate, and if Father finds out his secret has been revealed he might kill Shen right away.
9508 := We should inform the Jedi Council of this crime.
9509 := No! Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable, he might hurt him if you do that! He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus. 
9510 := I see. Well there is the answer we seek. The Jedi Council should be informed of this at once.
9511 := You don't think that perhaps there's more to look at here, do you? That maybe everything isn't what it appears?
9512 := Of course not. It seems very simple to me. The Council must be allowed to decide the next step.
9513 := I will go now.
9514 := Why do you care about Shen?
9515 := What is the problem between your families?
9516 := Come with me Rahasia... it's the only way Shen will leave the estate.
9517 := I'm trying to rescue Shen, but he won't leave without you, Rahasia.
9518 := I'll leave when I'm good and ready! 
9519 := I have come to apologize for my earlier behavior. 
9520 := I am here to find Shen Matale. Maybe we can help each other.
9521 := Yes, I will help you.
9522 := What I do is my own business, so back off!
9523 := I just came to tell your Nurik about his son Casus.
9524 := Do you know something about Shen's disappearance? 
9525 := Who are you? 
9526 := Casus was killed by kath hounds. The Matales had nothing to do with it!
9527 := Casus disappeared?
9528 := I don't have time to listen to this.
9529 := Does this have anything to do with what happened to Shen? 
9530 := Tell me what's going on here! 
9531 := Judge him? What has your father done? 
9532 := I only want to find Shen Matale.
9533 := Quit stalling and get to the point!
9534 := Please, tell me what has happened. 
9535 := What happened to Casus?
9536 := Why are you telling me all this?
9537 := This isn't my problem.
9538 := I must tell the Jedi Council at once! 
9539 := If you can convince Rahasia to escape with us I will accompany you - though I do not know if she would be willing to turn her back on her home and family.
9540 := Who could imagine a Sandral doing such a thing for the sake of a Matale. But if she will not go, then I too shall stay.
9541 := I would rather face my own death, than have her face her father's wrath because I escaped.
9542 := Thank you. I wish you luck.
9543 := I was taught to hate the Sandrals. To think of them as evil and subhuman. But from the moment I saw Rahasia one day in the city, I knew that my father was wrong.
9544 := She was like an angel: all white silks and perfume, seeming to float above the crowds.
9545 := I don't know what else I could have done but fall in love with her. For months I wooed her and tried to win her heart. I believe I have succeeded, but now this has happened...
9546 := Our families are always coming between us in one way or another. Please find her and convince her to run away with me.
9547 := My father thinks the Sandrals are thieves and liars who followed him here to Dantooine just to steal what he has earned for himself.
9548 := My father is an egotist and can be violent at times, but I think he still cares for me. Rahasia's father seems to be falling into the same pattern as mine.
9549 := They're both too unreasonable to be talked to about the other. I think the only hope Rahasia and I will have is if we can escape both of them...
9550 := Please find Rahasia and speak to her. Get her to flee this place with me.
9551 := You are back. Have you spoken to Rahasia?
9552 := I pray she is not just telling me what I want to hear. But I will have to take that chance. Hurry, then. We must not keep Rahasia waiting.
9553 := Who are you? What do you want with me? Are you working for my father?
9554 := As you wish. I have no quarrel with you. 
9555 := Rescue me? No... I won't leave. It's too dangerous.
9556 := It is not my own safety I am concerned about. I am worried about the fate of Nurik's daughter, Rahasia. She has been trying to convince her father to release me ever since I was captured. 
9557 := If I escape, Nurik will think Rahasia is to blame. Nurik is insane with grief over the loss of his son Casus. If I leave with you, it is Rahasia who will suffer. I cannot allow that.
9558 := If you do that, I'll scream my head off and alert all the guards in the house! The only chance you have is to talk Rahasia into leaving.
9559 := I will go speak to Rahasia.
9560 := Why do you care so much about Rahasia?
9561 := Why do your families hate each other so much?
9562 := Yes. She promised she would meet us outside the gates. 
9563 := Anyone tell you you ask too many questions? Now sit down and shut up!
9564 := I am here to rescue you, Shen.
9565 := I'll protect you, Shen. Let's go. 
9566 := If you don't come with me, I'll drag you out!
9567 := Fine. Stay in here and rot.
9568 := What if we take Rahasia with us?
9569 := How can I get you to come with me?

9600 := Star Forge
9601 := Unknown World
9602 := Leviathan
9603 := Korriban
9604 := Manaan
9605 := Kashyyyk
9606 := Tatooine
9607 := Dantooine
9608 := Taris
9609 := Endar Spire
9610 := You felt it, yes? Another vision? The Force continues to work through us; showing us the Star Maps unearthed by Revan and Malak.
9611 := Another vision. The Force is guiding us, helping us retrace the steps of Malak and his old Master. Leading us ever closer to the Star Forge.
9612 := The Force has given us a... a vision. Like the one we shared on Dantooine. Did you see it? Of course... you must have. The Force is strong with us both.
9613 := It is strange that anyone would have built a Star Map here; the entire surface of Manaan is covered by nothing but vast oceans.
9614 := It is possible. The melting of polar caps or a cataclysmic earthquake could have buried the land beneath the waves eons ago. Records from that time are incomplete.
9615 := The ocean floor is vast and much of it is uncharted, even by the native Selkath. But how could Revan and Malak have found their way down?
9616 := Tatooine is known for little but blowing sand. I find it surprising that there would be a Star Map somewhere in its desolate wastes.
9617 := Perhaps, though that would have been tens of thousands of years in the past. Now there is nothing but the howling emptiness of the Dune Sea.
9618 := The Star Map would likely have to be within some kind of shelter to protect it against dust and sandstorms.
9619 := I suspect there are many such caves and caverns hidden in the sands of the Dune Sea. The creatures of this world probably use them as their lairs.
9620 := Kashyyyk is a lush but simple and undeveloped world. I would not have expected to find the alien technology of a Star Map here.
9621 := The Wookiees of Kashyyyk make their home high among the wroshyr branches; only their bravest warriors dare to descend into the forbidding depths of the forest.
9622 := If the Star Map is located far beneath us on the planet's surface, as our vision seems to suggest, it is unlikely the Wookiees even know of its existence.
9623 := There are some who believe Korriban is the birth place of the Sith... this planet is an evil place. There are secrets here best left uncovered.
9624 := The visions are as much yours as mine - and they are the key to finding the Star Forge and stopping Malak!
9625 := You are right, of course. We cannot turn away from the path we have started on... no matter where it may lead.
9626 := During the vision I felt cold and trapped; almost as if I was buried alive. It felt... it felt like we were in some kind of tomb.
9627 := No doubt things will become more clear once we discover the Star Map's location.
9628 := Dantooine... it seems like a lifetime since I last set foot on her surface, though in truth it has only been a few months. We should be safe from Malak here... for now, at least.
9629 := Safe? You saw what his fleet did to Taris: there wasn't a building over two stories high left standing! They...they turned the planet into one big pile of rubble.
9630 := Even the Sith would think twice before attacking Dantooine. There are many Jedi here, including several of the most powerful Masters of the Order. There is great strength within this place.
9631 := We can't just keep running; Malak will find us eventually. We need to regroup; we need a plan.
9632 := We can get supplies here and recuperate. The Academy is a place of mental and spiritual healing; something we could all use after what we've been through.
9633 := Maybe you're right. It isn't easy to witness the annihilation of an entire planet. I know Mission must be taking it pretty hard.
9634 := She will find a way to come to terms with her grief. She is stronger than she appears. We just need to give her time.
9635 := Now I must go speak with the Council. I need their advice on... recent developments. After I have met with them I will meet you outside the ship.
9636 := Maybe the land was once above the surface.
9637 := It looked like the Star Map was underwater.
9638 := Maybe Tatooine wasn't always a desert.
9639 := It looked like it was inside some kind of cave.
9640 := Do you think the Wookiees are involved?
9641 := It looked like the Star Map was on the forest floor.
9642 := I don't have time for your visions, Bastila!
9643 := We have to uncover those secrets if we want to stop Malak.
9644 := It looked like the Star Map was in some sort of cave.
9645 := I think Carth has a point. We should keep moving.
9646 := I agree with Bastila. We should be safe here.
9647 := What was that? What's wrong? Did one of the Sith fighters hit us?
9648 := No, it's something else. We've flown into some kind of disruptor field. All my instruments are jammed... we've got massive overloads on all systems!
9649 := I'm picking up a single planet in this system. I'll try and put us down here. Hold on - this may be a rough landing.
9650 := The Star Forge... it's huge. I've never seen anything like it before.
9651 := I can feel the power of the dark side emanating from that space station. It almost feels like... like it's alive. That must be where Malak has taken Bastila.
9652 := I'm transmitting these co-ordinates to Admiral Dodonna. Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet. 
9653 := Message is away. We should probably wait for the Republic fleet to show up before we try and rescue Bastila. We'll need cover if we want to fly in and dock on the Star Forge.
9654 := We've got company... a small vanguard of Sith fighters, coming in hard! Get on those gun turrets! Take those fighters out before they report our position to the main fleet!

9742 := Hey, where's Bastila? What happened on the ship?
9743 := Where is Bastila? What happened on that ship?
9744 := Where is Bastila? What happened on the ship?
9745 := We ran into Malak. He would have killed us, but Bastila sacrificed herself so we could get away.
9746 := You mean she's... she's dead?
9747 := Malak won't kill her. I think he'll want to use her battle meditation against the Republic. He'll keep her alive so he can turn her to the dark side!
9748 := The Dark Lord will not kill her. He will want to use her battle meditation ability against the Republic. He will take her alive so he can turn her to the dark side. I am sure of it.
9749 := Bah. Malak won't kill her, don't be foolish. He'll want to use her battle meditation against the Republic. Turn her to the dark side and the Sith will always be victorious.
9750 := Not so fast. We've got a bigger issue to deal with here. They deserve to know the truth about you. Do you want to tell them what Malak said, or should I?
9751 := Threats? You can't bully me - though I shouldn't be surprised now that I know who you really are... Revan.
9752 := Revan? What... what are you talking about? Is this some kind of joke?
9753 := No, it's no joke. The Jedi Council captured Revan and erased the Dark Lord's mind, programming in a new identity. Saul Karath told me on the Leviathan and Bastila confirmed it!
9754 := You're Darth Revan? This is... this is big. Do you... do you remember anything about being the Dark Lord?
9755 := And so the lies begin. It was obvious you remembered something back there when Malak confronted you with the truth. It might have only been small pieces, but there was something there!
9756 := Just a few flashes? That's it? Nothing more? Then I don't think there's a problem.
9757 := It seems to me that if you don't really remember anything about being Revan, then it doesn't really matter anymore. You are who you are now, right?
9758 := Of course it still matters! How do we know more memories won't come flooding back? How do we know Revan won't suddenly turn on us?
9759 := The whole time we've been chasing after Malak we've had his old Sith Master right at our side; listening to our secrets; hearing our plans!
9760 := Big Z and I will stick by you. We owe you our lives; we won't desert you now!
9761 := How can you say that, Mission? The Sith bombed my home world! Revan took away my family and destroyed my life!
9762 := Everyone knows it was Malak who gave the order to attack your people, Carth. You can't blame Revan for that.
9763 := I... I suppose you've proven yourself to be a friend of the Republic by your actions so far... Revan. But can I trust you? Can any of us?
9764 := It, uh... it all makes sense now... Revan. I've watched you, I've seen your cruelty. I've seen your... your dark side. And now this! I don't know if I can trust you. Can any of us?
9765 := It was Saul Karath who commanded the fleet that attacked your people, Carth. And it was Malak who gave the order. You know this.
9766 := I have felt the presence of the dark side in you, Revan - as it is in all of us. I know the dangers of that path; yet I also know the fallen can be redeemed.
9767 := I can tell there is conflict between light and darkness within you. I do not know which way the struggle will turn, but I will not abandon you in this difficult time, as you did not abandon me.
9768 := I have seen signs of the taint of the dark side in your actions and deeds, but I will not give up on you as you did not give up on me. I will stay with you, Revan.
9769 := I judge you by your actions, and as long as we have been together I have seen you act as a servant of the light.
9770 := I don't know. Maybe I just need time to, uh... to think about it.
9771 := The others seem to trust you... and we need you to stop the Sith. And I suppose Malak is the real enemy here. But I don't have much choice but to go along with this for now, do I?
9772 := Well, the others seem to trust you... and I don't see any other way that we can stop the Sith. And I suppose that Malak is the real enemy here... I really don't have any other choice, do I? 
9773 := Don't worry - I won't let my personal feelings get in the way of my assignments or this mission. But don't forget: I've sworn an oath to defend the Republic!
9774 := As long as this mission stays on course I'll stick with you. But I won't let you betray the Republic under any circumstances!
9775 := So I guess that's it then... we keep going. We've still got one more Star Map to uncover if we're going to find that Star Forge and save Bastila, so let's do it before it's too late. 
9776 := I see. Well, I guess that answers a lot of my questions about who you really are.
9777 := I want to believe you. You've proven yourself time and time again during our mission, but this is a little much for me to wrap my mind around.
9778 := This must be even more of a shock to you... I don't know how you even keep going. I guess we both just have to find a way to push forward.
9779 := Don't worry about me - I'm a soldier. I can put aside my misgivings for now. We can, uh... we can talk later, you and I. Just give me time.
9780 := Beep! Beep! Beep! Woop-woooop!
9781 := I knew the little guy would come through for you - droids don't hold grudges.
9782 := Commentary: I am... experiencing something unusual, master.
9783 := Answer: My programming is activating my deleted memory core. I believe I have a... a homing system that is restoring it, master.
9784 := Observation: That is unnecessary, master. My intent is not hostile. I am receiving no combat override commands.
9785 := Observation: My homing system is a function of my assassination protocols... that which I told you had been de-activated. This system was not.
9786 := It seems that the homing system deliberately restores my deleted memory core upon... upon returning to my original master.
9787 := Affirmation: Correct, master. Sith protocols maintain that all droid knowledge be deleted before assassination missions, and restored upon return.
9788 := I have returned to you, and my full functionality is now under your personal command. It is a distinct pleasure to see you again, master.
9789 := Commentary: I believe I have served you well in the past, master, and will continue to do so for as long as you have need of me.
9790 := Wow. What are the chances of that happening?
9791 := Remember we're talking about the Force, here. At this point Malak himself could drop out of the sky and I wouldn't bat an eyelash.
9792 := Beep! Beep-beep boop! Bwoooop.
9793 := Good point.
9794 := Observation: That does not matter, master. I am your droid, regardless of your actions or personality.
9795 := Think you'd never heard of the Force before. Seems obvious enough to me it was meant to be.
9796 := Observation: Indeed. I do hope we shall have the chance to engage in combat together again soon, master.
9797 := Explanation: I believe so, master. I was unaware of my homing system until it had been activated.
9798 := You defeated the Mandalore clans in the war, Revan. You were the only one in the galaxy who could best us.
9799 := We had never met one like you before, and never since. How can you even ask if I will follow you?
9800 := Whatever you are fighting, it will be worthy of my skill. I'm your man until the end, Revan, no matter how this plays out.
9801 := What about me? I already knew who you were, though it wasn't my place to tell you. Better off that you know, if you ask me.
9802 := Does it change anything? I'm not here to judge you. You'll do what you have to, and I'll help if I can.
9803 := I don't know if I can get over it that easily, Mission. I mean... after all Revan did... how could any of us forgive her?
9804 := I don't see the Sith Lord standing here, I see a friend who's been with us through thick and thin! Remember - Malak's the one who tried to destroy Taris!
9805 := I agree with Mission. I swore a life-debt to the person you are, not to the person you were.
9806 := Hey - you've got nothing to be sorry about! You didn't ask for this. Besides, I know you... you're not Revan anymore. Whatever you used to be, you're one of us now!
9807 := I've been such a fool! I... I swore to protect you! And here you were the enemy all this time!
9808 := Oh, it changes everything! It was... it was you! You were the one that attacked my world! You were the one that destroyed my life!
9809 := It doesn't matter who's to blame. You're still the one who did it. You killed my wife... you betrayed everything that I believed in! You destroyed my life!
9810 := But it is true. It's horribly true! It was...it was you... you killed my wife, you ravaged my world. You...you destroyed my life!
9811 := But... you're the one responsible for the death of my wife, the destruction of my home world! You destroyed my life!
9812 := How could I have been such a fool! How could I have not known?! How could you betray me like this?!
9813 := Get over it? Yeah... yeah, I can get over it. I should have figured out earlier you weren't what you seemed. That's my fault.
9814 := Do you think everybody else is going to be so quick to 'get over it'? You think they're going to follow a Sith Lord?
9815 := You should have known. I...*sigh* I should have figured it out. I just can't... was, was everything a lie, then? Everything we talked about?
9816 := This isn't a joke. You know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about you, about the way you felt...
9817 := Was the woman we knew Revan or... or someone else? Will you change into Revan? How...how can any of us trust you?
9818 := Well, I trust you! I know you... and you're not Revan anymore. Whatever you used to be, you're one of us now!
9819 := That's what I feared. Who's to say your old life won't come back... everything you felt and thought, all of it?
9820 := Are you sure? I'm not sure what to believe any more. Who's to say that your old life won't come back... all of it?
9821 := Not so fast. I need to know if what Malak said about you is true or not, first. You aren't... you *can't* be, can you?
9822 := I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by your attitude now that I know who you really are... Revan.
9823 := We can't help Bastila - not unless we find the Star Forge first.
9824 := We have to go back for Bastila!
9825 := Say one word and you're dead, Carth!
9826 := I'll tell them. I'm... I'm Darth Revan.
9827 := I don't care what Malak said! I'm not Darth Revan, I'm <FullName>.
9828 := I don't remember anything about being Revan.
9829 := Small bits. A few strange dreams and visions. That's all.
9830 := This changes nothing! I still want to stop Malak!
9831 := Well, Carth... what are you going to do?
9832 := Well, Carth - will you stand with me against Malak?
9833 := You're right - you don't have a choice! I'm in charge here!
9834 := I'm not Revan anymore, Carth. You have to believe that.
9835 := I won't let you down, Carth. I promise.
9836 := You have to find a way to deal with this, Carth.
9837 := How do you think I feel?
9838 := You have to try... for Bastila's sake.
9839 := You won't abandon me, will you T3?
9840 := What do you have to say, HK-47?
9841 := Why? What's happening?
9842 := I'll destroy you if you make a move, droid!
9843 := Your homing system? What's that?
9844 := You mean... Revan?
9845 := Good. So long as you're loyal.
9846 := I'm not exactly Revan anymore, HK-47...
9847 := But I found you, you didn't find me!
9848 := Well... that makes a lot of sense, actually.
9849 := Everyone be careful... there's no telling what this means!
9850 := So this is the... stimuli you were waiting for?
9851 := What do you think, Canderous?
9852 := What about you, Jolee?
9853 := Blame the Jedi Council for this, Carth - not me!
9854 := But I'm not the Dark Lord anymore, I'm <FullName>. I'm one of you!
9855 := I'm sorry, Carth... I wish this wasn't true.
9856 := This changes nothing. I am who I am.
9857 := Blame the Jedi Council for this, Carth - not me!
9858 := I'm sorry, Carth... I wish this wasn't true.
9859 := I'm not your enemy, Carth, I swear!
9860 := Get over it, Carth. We've got more important things to think about.
9861 := Please, Carth... don't do this to me!
9862 := I didn't know I was Revan! How could I have known?!
9863 := Why? Were you lying to me all that time?
9864 := I don't know. Everything has changed, now.
9865 := Everything that was important was real, Carth.
9866 := Back off, Carth! There's nothing you can do about it!
9867 := It looks that way. I'm... Darth Revan.

9951 := Endar Spire
9952 := You felt it, yes? Another vision? The Force continues to work through us; showing us the Star Maps unearthed by Revan and Malak.
9953 := Another vision. The Force is guiding us, helping us retrace the steps of Malak and his old Master. Leading us ever closer to the Star Forge.
9954 := The Force has given us a... a vision. Like the one we shared on Dantooine. Did you see it? Of course... you must have. The Force is strong with us both.
9955 := It is strange that anyone would have built a Star Map here; the entire surface of Manaan is covered by nothing but vast oceans.
9956 := It is possible. The melting of polar caps or a cataclysmic earthquake could have buried the land beneath the waves eons ago. Records from that time are incomplete.
9957 := The ocean floor is vast and much of it is uncharted, even by the native Selkath. But how could Revan and Malak have found their way down?
9958 := Tatooine is known for little but blowing sand. I find it surprising that there would be a Star Map somewhere in its desolate wastes.
9959 := Perhaps, though that would have been tens of thousands of years in the past. Now there is nothing but the howling emptiness of the Dune Sea.
9960 := The Star Map would likely have to be within some kind of shelter to protect it against dust and sandstorms.
9961 := I suspect there are many such caves and caverns hidden in the sands of the Dune Sea. The creatures of this world probably use them as their lairs.
9962 := Kashyyyk is a lush but simple and undeveloped world. I would not have expected to find the alien technology of a Star Map here.
9963 := The Wookiees of Kashyyyk make their home high among the Wroshyr branches; only their bravest warriors dare to descend into the forbidding depths of the forest.
9964 := If the Star Map is located far beneath us on the planet's surface, as our vision seems to suggest, it is unlikely the Wookiees even know of its existence.
9965 := There are some who believe Korriban is the birth place of the Sith... this planet is an evil place. There are secrets here best left uncovered.
9966 := The visions are as much yours as mine - and they are the key to finding the Star Forge and stopping Malak!
9967 := You are right, of course. We cannot turn away from the path we have started on... no matter where it may lead.
9968 := During the vision I felt cold and trapped; almost as if I was buried alive. It felt... it felt like we were in some kind of tomb.
9969 := No doubt things will become more clear once we discover the Star Map's location.
9970 := Dantooine... it seems like a lifetime since I last set foot on her surface, though in truth it has only been a few months. We should be safe from Malak here... for now, at least.
9971 := Safe? You saw what his fleet did to Taris: there wasn't a building over two stories high left standing! They turned the planet into one big pile of rubble.
9972 := Even the Sith would think twice before attacking Dantooine. There are many Jedi here, including several of the most powerful Masters of the Order. There is great strength within this place.
9973 := We can't just keep running; Malak will find us eventually. We need to regroup; we need a plan.
9974 := We can get supplies here and recuperate. The Academy is a place of mental and spiritual healing; something we could all use after what we've been through.
9975 := Maybe you're right. It isn't easy to witness the annihilation of an entire planet. I know Mission must be taking it pretty hard.
9976 := She will find a way to come to terms with her grief. She is stronger than she appears. We just need to give her time.
9977 := Now I must go speak with the Council. I need their advice on... recent developments. After I have met with them I will meet you outside the ship.
9978 := Maybe the land was once above the surface.
9979 := It looked like the Star Map was underwater.
9980 := Maybe Tatooine wasn't always a desert.
9981 := It looked like it was inside some kind of cave.
9982 := Do you think the Wookiees are involved?
9983 := It looked like the Star Map was on the forest floor.
9984 := I don't have time for your visions, Bastila!
9985 := We have to uncover those secrets if we want to stop Malak.
9986 := It looked like the Star Map was in some sort of cave.
9987 := I think Carth has a point. We should keep moving.
9988 := I agree with Bastila. We should be safe here.
9989 := What was that? What's wrong? Did one of the Sith fighters hit us?
9990 := No, it's something else. We've flown into some kind of disruptor field. All my instruments are jammed... we've got massive overloads on all systems!
9991 := I'm picking up a single planet in this system. I'm gonna try and put us down there. Hold on - this might be a rough landing.
9992 := The Star Forge... it's huge. I've never seen anything like it before.
9993 := I can feel the power of the dark side emanating from that space station. It almost feels like... like it's alive. That must be where Malak has taken Bastila.
9994 := I'm transmitting these co-ordinates to Admiral Dodonna. Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet. 
9995 := Message is away. We should probably wait for the Republic fleet to show up before we try and rescue Bastila. We'll need cover if we want to fly in and dock on the Star Forge.
9996 := We've got company... a small vanguard of Sith fighters, coming in hard! Get on those gun turrets! Take those fighters out before they report our position to the main fleet!

10049 := Hey, where are you going? We can't leave the planet yet. Remember all those wrecked ships we saw?
10050 := Until we get inside that temple and find some way to disable that disruptor field, the Ebon Hawk is grounded.
10051 := We need to salvage some new stabilizers or the Ebon Hawk won't even be able to get off the ground.
10052 := Whew! Talk about your rough landings, Carth! What's the matter? You're flying like you've been on an all night Tarisian ale drinking binge!
10053 := That disruptor field fried our stabilizers - we're lucky we made it down in one piece! But if we can't find the salvage to make repairs I won't even be able to get the Ebon Hawk airborne again!
10054 := You know, during our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Maybe the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.
10055 := The old man's right: this planet's a technological graveyard. I saw dozens of downed ships out there. That disruptor field must have wiped them all out. 
10056 := Even if we get the stabilizers fixed, we'll have to find and disable the source of that disruptor field before we can take off. Otherwise we'll just end up crashing again.
10057 := They must have some kind of protection against it. But the Republic fleet won't. We have to find a way to disable that disruptor field or the Sith will slaughter them!
10058 := You're right! That Sith fleet we saw must have some type of protection against the disruptor field. We have to find a way to disable it or the Republic will be slaughtered!
10059 := There's massive power fluctuations on the ship's sensors. They seem to be coming from some type of large stone structure to the east... it looks like some kind of ancient temple. 
10060 := Beep, boop, beep.
10061 := T3's picking up massive power fluctuations on the ship's sensors. They seem to be coming from some type of large stone structure to the east... it looks like some kind of ancient temple. 
10062 := Good idea. If that temple's generating power it probably has something to do with that disruptor field.
10063 := The stabilizers won't do much good if we don't disable that disruptor field first. Otherwise, we'll end up crashing back down to the planet's surface again. And this time we might not survive!
10064 := Hey, don't forget about Bastila, guys! We still have to rescue her, too.
10065 := We haven't forgotten about her. But we can't do her much good stuck down here. We have to help ourselves before we can help her.
10066 := I just hope we're not too late. Bastila's been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he turns her to the dark side she'll join him and the Sith will become invincible.
10067 := I only hope we're not too late. Bastila has been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he can turn her to the dark side she will join him and the Sith will be invincible.
10068 := I remember... though I hoped you would not be so quick to embrace the being you once were. If Bastila feels as you do then she is lost to us, Revan.
10069 := I fear Bastila will find the lure of the dark side difficult to resist. She is strong in the Force, but she is also impulsive, willful and proud - as you once were, Revan.
10070 := Let us hope it does not come to that.
10071 := Well, if Bastila is on the Star Forge like you think, Jolee, then we can't rescue her until we disable that disruptor field. The sooner we investigate that temple to the east the better.
10072 := We can probably find the wreckage of a downed ship along the way. If we're lucky we can salvage some stabilizers from it to get off this planet.
10073 := I hope everything works out as smooth as you make it sound, Carth.
10074 := So do I, Mission. So do I.
10075 := I am glad to hear you say that. Now that you know your true identity I was afraid you might slip back over to the dark side. If Bastila feels as you do there may yet be hope for her.
10076 := During our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Perhaps the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.
10077 := The Cathar's right: this planet's a technological graveyard. I saw dozens of downed ships out there. That disruptor field must have wiped them all out. But where could it be coming from?
10078 := Bastila - you're alive! I was worried about you. For a minute there I was sure we'd never see you again once Malak got his... wait a minute.
10079 := Where's Jolee Bindo? Is he okay? What happened inside that temple?
10080 := Where are Juhani and Jolee Bindo? Are they okay? What happened inside that temple?
10081 := What... what are you talking about?
10082 := The Jedi Council has failed, Carth - Darth Revan has been reborn! Together we will destroy Malak and seize control of his fleet, then use it to crush the Republic!
10083 := Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. He died for his foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!
10084 := Juhani and Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. They died for their foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!
10085 := No - we serve the Republic! You're no better than Malak! We'll never swear allegiance to one who serves the dark side!
10086 := Wait, Lord Revan. Carth speaks only for himself - he does not speak for the others. He may find he stands alone here!
10087 := The droids will continue to serve you Revan - they are programmed to obey their master. And there may be others who will choose to join us. 
10088 := The Republic is doomed, Revan has returned! Who will now swear loyalty to the second coming of the Dark Lord?
10089 := You're Revan and I'll follow you anywhere. It doesn't matter who you're fighting against, I'll be at your side. Mandalorians don't have any great love for the Republic anyway.
10090 := Light side, dark side - it doesn't make any difference to me, Revan. I'll stick by your side no matter what comes.
10091 := I saw what the Sith did to Taris - anyone who serves the dark side is evil! Big Z and I are with Carth on this one!
10092 := No, Mission. I am bound by the oath of my life debt. I... I must stand with Revan. 
10093 := Zaalbar - Revan's a Sith! Just like Malak! It's not a betrayal if you break your life debt now!
10094 := If I go back on my vow I am betraying myself, my people and my ancestors. I cannot do that. Please, Mission - join us.
10095 := No, Zaalbar. I don't care! I won't help the Sith against the Republic! Not for anything! Not even for you!
10096 := You don't have to help the Sith, Mission. Not while I'm here.
10097 := Run for it, Mission! Get to the jungle! Go! Go!
10098 := No, Carth! Don't do it!
10099 := I won't let you do this to yourself. I... I love you. No matter what.
10100 := Run for it, Mission! Get to the jungle! Go! Go!
10101 := Let him go! We have more important things to worry about. We have to get to the Star Forge and kill Malak. Then we can turn our attention to the Republic.
10102 := No, you can't mean that! This... this isn't you! You're not Revan, I know it!
10103 := You've got to resist it! This isn't you talking... we can help you, we can find a way to --
10104 := My, my. I think the sad fool may actually be in love with you, Revan.
10105 := I refuse to believe that! We'll stop you if we have to, all of us. We'll save you from yourselves!
10106 := Never! You're not the woman I love. We'll stop you if we have to, all of us.
10107 := You're back! But where's Bastila? Is she alive? What happened inside that Temple?
10108 := Hold on a second! What about Bastila? Wasn't she in the Temple? What happened?
10109 := Dead? I... I can't believe it.
10110 := She's not dead, Carth - though that might have been easier for you to accept. She's fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.
10111 := She is not dead, Carth - though maybe that might have been easier for you to accept. She has fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.
10112 := The dark side? Bastila? No! How could that happen?
10113 := She was always in danger of being seduced by the dark side, Carth. Bastila was strong, but she was always impatient and headstrong. Malak preyed upon her weaknesses.
10114 := This planet is a tainted place, the Star Forge and the Temple have twisted the Force into an instrument of evil - just as Malak has twisted Bastila into a servant of the Sith. 
10115 := Weakness has nothing to do with the corruption of the dark side. A Jedi must always guard against pride and the desire for power. Especially you.
10116 := In the end we all choose our own path, but keep in mind the role that you played in her downfall. You and the task assigned to her by the Jedi Council.
10117 := Remember the bond that was forged between you when she rekindled the spark that was your life. Through that bond she touched your memories... and also the echo of the dark taint within you.
10118 := But there's still hope for her, right? I mean, Revan rejected the dark side so Bastila could too, right? We still might be able to save her.
10119 := I'm not sure what's in store for us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play. I have no doubt she'll be waiting for us on the Star Forge.
10120 := I don't know what fate awaits us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play in the events to come. I have no doubt she will be waiting for us on the Star Forge.
10121 := No doubt. Let's go, then, before she has time to organize a bigger welcoming committee.
10122 := No doubt. I must say that it's good to have you with us, my dear. For a minute there I thought you might decide... well, never mind what I thought.
10123 := Decide? Decide what?
10124 := Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.
10125 := Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.
10126 := So... you did it? You turned against Revan once and for all? I knew she wasn't part of you anymore. I knew it.
10127 := I told you that you would have to make a choice eventually, that you would be tested. I think that was it, I can feel it.
10128 := And you did exactly what I'd hoped you would. It couldn't have been easy... I'm very proud of you.
10129 := Always. I'm not certain any one of us wouldn't have been tempted by Bastila's offer.
10130 := I... I love you. I can't wait until all of this is over with.
10131 := Right. Sorry. I just... can't remember the last time I felt this happy. I can wait until the Star Forge is destroyed.
10132 := You make that sound so easy. Just fly over and boom, one less Star Forge in the universe, huh?
10133 := I feel more confident now than I ever did before. The Force is with us, Mission.
10134 := Well, I'm an old man and I know you should take love when you can find it. Good for you two, I say.
10135 := Beep! Beep-beep boop!!
10136 := Answer: I have no idea what they speak of, droid. Organic meatbags are an eternal mystery to me.
10137 := Confidence is all well and good, Carth, but if we are going to catch up to Bastila we should leave soon, don't you think?
10138 := Okay - let's get moving. The longer we wait the harder this is going to be!
10139 := Hey! Sheesh... get a room, will ya?
10140 := That two spirits have found each other amidst such turmoil is a good omen, Mission. Does it not please you to see?
10141 := Oh, sure. Even a good omen can get itself a room, though, don't ya think?
10142 := I know. I can't blame Bastila for being turned, however... she's just so young and doesn't deserve this kind of fate.
10143 := I'm sure she did. I can't say that any one of us wouldn't have been tempted.
10144 := Malak has a strong hold on Bastila now - it will be difficult for her to break free of his influence. Especially considering her long association with you.
10145 := I wonder why the Sith ships aren't affected by the disruptor field?
10146 := That disruptor field could wipe out the entire Republic fleet!
10147 := Let's go check it out.
10148 := Hey - I thought we needed to find some stabilizers for the ship!
10149 := You all seem to be forgetting about Bastila!
10150 := Even together they are no match for me. I used to be the Sith Lord, remember?
10151 := Bastila would never turn to the dark side!
10152 := If Bastila's joined Malak then she'll suffer the same fate he does!
10153 := Don't call me that. I'm not Revan anymore.
10154 := He didn't make it.
10155 := I went over to the dark side, Carth. That's what happened.
10156 := They didn't make it.
10157 := I have reclaimed the title of Darth Revan! Bow before me!
10158 := I guess I'll just have to kill you all, then.
10159 := Not everyone is as foolish as you are, Carth!
10160 := Not everyone is willing to throw their life away for the Republic, Carth!
10161 := Zaalbar, what about you?
10162 := Mission, what about you?
10163 := It's too bad it had to come to this, Carth.
10164 := Then I guess it's time for you to die!
10165 := You don't stand a chance against all of us, Carth.
10166 := You're a fool. You always were.
10167 := And just what are you going to do about it?
10168 := That doesn't matter any more, Carth.
10169 := Only you serve the Republic, Carth. You don't speak for the others.
10170 := If you resist me, Carth, I'll destroy you!
10171 := Don't be a blind fool, Carth. Open your eyes.
10172 := How sad. I guess there's no future for us after all, is there?
10173 := All of you? Are you sure of that?
10174 := Don't resist me, Carth, or I'll be forced to destroy you.
10175 := Join me, Carth. You can rule at my side, it's not too late.
10176 := This is my choice, Carth, whether you like it or not.
10177 := Does it matter who I am? I have joined the dark side.
10178 := I am Revan, Carth. Now and forever.
10179 := No time! We have to get off this planet and get to the Star Forge!
10180 := Bastila is dead, Carth. Malak killed her.
10181 := Bastila has fallen to the dark side. She fled to the Star Forge.
10182 := Bastila is lost to us now. She deserves to die.
10183 := Malak corrupted Bastila because she was weak.
10184 := I can't help but feel this is partly my fault.
10185 := It's too late for her. Just accept it.
10186 := It took the whole Jedi Council and a mind wipe to save me. What chance does she have?
10187 := We can try... and we will.
10188 := Once and for all? What are you talking about?
10189 := Thank you. I appreciate the support.
10190 := We've got a long way to go yet, Carth.
10191 := Hey, cool your engines there.
10192 := I love you, too.
10193 := I could never do what Bastila did.
10194 := It wasn't easy at all. Bastila made a good case.
10195 := I chose the light side. It's true.
10196 := Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Anything can still happen.
10197 := She can still be saved, can't she?
10198 := Galaxy Droid
10199 := Carth
10200 := Bastila
10201 := T3-M4
10202 := Swoop Droid

10221 := Endar Spire - Command Module
10222 := Bastila's escape pod's already gone, so there's no reason for us to stick around here and get shot by the Sith. Now come on - there'll be time for questions later!
10223 := You made it just in time! There's only one active escape pod left. Come on, we can hide out on the planet below!
10224 := I'm a soldier with the Republic, like you. We're the last two crew members left on the Endar Spire.
10225 := Be careful! There's a whole squad of Sith Troopers on the other side of that door! You need to find some way to thin their numbers.
10226 := You could reprogram the damaged assault droid to help you, if you have enough repair parts.
10227 := Or you could use computer spikes to slice into the terminal and use the Endar Spire's security systems against the Sith.
10228 := First, make sure you have a stealth field generator equipped on your belt. You can't use your stealth skill without one.
10229 := But be careful. There's a Sith patrol just down the corridor. Use your STEALTH skill to sneak past him.
10230 := Bastila's escape pod is away - you're the last surviving crew member of the Endar Spire! I can't wait for you much longer; you have to get to the escape pods!
10231 := You're the last Republic survivor on the Endar Spire! You have to get off the ship!
10232 := This is Carth Onasi on your personal communicator. I'm tracking your position through the Endar Spire's life support systems.
10233 := How do I know I can trust you?
10234 := Who are you?
10235 := [Security Lockdown. Access code required.]
10236 := [Security Lockdown. Hostiles in close proximity. Access denied.]
10237 := Bastila's not here on the bridge - they must have retreated to the escape pods! We better head that way too.
10238 := STAR WARS Knights of the Old Republic is a real-time turn based game. Each time you issue a command to a character they will carry out that action over the course of a three-second round.
10239 := Pressing a button multiple times won't make you perform commands any faster, but it will put that command into the action queue that appears to the left of the portrait of the selected character.
10240 := At the start of the next round the character will perform the next action in the que. You can have up to 3 commands in your action que.
10241 := Remember, it can take up to 3 rounds, or 9 seconds, for the last command entered into the action queue to take effect. If the queue is full new commands will overwrite previous commands.
10242 := You're injured! You better use that medpac you equipped in your quickslot. First, you have to select the character you want to use the medpac on.
Press the [WHITE] button to unpause.
10243 := Use the black button to cycle through the party members until you see your portrait highlighted at the bottom of the screen, then press the corresponding trigger to use the item in the quickslot.
Press the [WHITE] button to unpause.
10244 := Press "A" when the desired target is highlighted, then press the white button to unpause the game. You will throw your grenade once the action resumes.
10245 := Combat uses a pause and play system. Press the white button to pause and unpause the game so you can issue commands to your characters.
10246 := While paused you can still use the D-pad and black button to cycle through targets and party members.
10247 := Any commands you issue to your party while paused will go into an action queue. When you resume gameplay the commands will fire in the order you selected them.
10248 := The game is paused right now. In pause mode, set up your main character to throw a grenade at one of the Sith Troopers. Press "BACK" to resume the game after you issue your commands.
10249 := We'll be fighting in close quarters on the bridge. You better equip a melee weapon before we go through that door.
10250 := Just press [START] to bring up your menus and go to the EQUIP screen. Then set up items in your quickslots the same way you would equip weapons or armor.
10251 := During normal gameplay, press the left or right trigger to use the corresponding quickslot.
10252 := Highlight one of your quickslots and press "A" to bring up a list of available items. Grenades, medpacs and similar items can be equipped by highlighting the desired item and pressing "A".
10253 := Using a quickslot from the main screen does not pause the game, and is more convenient than using the EQUIP or INVENTORY screens. Everyone in the party shares the same two quickslots.
10254 := The bridge is just beyond that door. You better equip your melee weapon. There isn't much room on the bridge, and it's suicide to use a blaster in close quarters.
10255 := Your melee weapon is made using a cortosis weave. It's strong enough to stand up against anything, even a lightsaber.
10256 := Remember, you can access your map and other important menus by pressing the [START] button. Then use the triggers to scroll to the MAP screen.
10257 := Use the left trigger to scroll to the MAP screen. This shows your current location and the direction you are facing, as well as notes marking important locations in the area.
10258 := The corridor branches off. You better check your map to make sure we're going the right way!
10259 := To use a computer simply target the terminal and press "A". This will bring up a computer screen with a list of commands you can enter at that terminal.
10260 := Just target the computer and press "A" to slice into it.
10261 := The higher your computer skill, the less spikes it will take to override the system. The number of spikes to perform an action is displayed beside each command.
10262 := Sometimes you will select an option that is not possible. In this case you will get a message saying "SPIKE REJECTION". You will not lose your spikes in this case.
10263 := Okay, the maintenance droid is here, but he's damaged too! Don't worry, you can use your droid repair skills and some repair parts to fix him.
10264 := Switch to me and use my repair skills on that disabled droid. Maybe I can reprogram it to ram the door open for us.
10265 := Maybe you can use your repair skill to reprogram that disabled droid to ram the door open for us.
10266 := To use your repair skill on a disabled droid, target the droid and press "A". This will bring up a list of actions you can program in, and the number of repair parts the choice will require.
10267 := Simply target the disabled droid and press "A" to get the repair options to appear. Fixing droids uses up repair parts.
10268 := The harder something is to repair or reprogram, the more parts you need. The higher your repair skill, the less parts you need.
10269 := The door's jammed! It must have been damaged during the attack - we'll have to figure out a way to get past it.
10270 := Switch to me and use my computer skill on that terminal to see if I can override the system and open the door.
10271 := Use that computer terminal to see if you can slice into the system and order up a maintenance droid to fix the door for us.
10272 := We have to get to the bridge.
10273 := This is Carth Onasi - the Sith are threatening to overrun our position! We can't hold out long against their firepower! All hands to the bridge!
10274 := That was Carth contacting us on our portable communicators. He's one of the Republic's best pilots! He's seen more combat than the rest of the Endar Spire's crew put together.
10275 := If he says things are bad, you better believe it. We have to get to the bridge to help defend Bastila!
10276 := Now that the door's open you better take the lead again.
10277 := Target the door using the thumbsticks or the triggers. When the targeting circle is focused on the door, you'll see the icons in the ACTION MENU at the bottom left of the screen have changed.
10278 := If the character you control has the security skill it will appear in the action menu. Use the D-pad to scroll up and down to select the SECURITY option, then press "A". If your skill is high enough, the door will open.
10279 := Use the D-pad to cycle through the action until SECURITY is highlighted, then press <abutton>. Remember, the SECURITY icon only appears if you're controlling a character with the SECURITY skill.
10280 := That door's locked. I don't have the codes to open it, but switch me to the party leader so you can use my security skills to slice into the access panel and open the door.
10281 := That door's locked, and I don't have the codes to open it. You'll have to use your security skill on it if we want to get past.
10282 := To use an item like a medpac - or to use a feat, skill or Force power - you'll need to know how to use your ACTION MENU.
10283 := The [START] button bring ups the menu screens you used before. Use the triggers to cycle through until you reach the EQUIP screen. It shows a portrait of the character you currently control.
10284 := Use the triggers to bring up the shared party INVENTORY screen. There is no limit to the number of items your party can carry. Special plot items are stored in a separate inventory.
10285 := Your entire party shares the same inventory. There is no limit to the number of items you can carry. If you drop an item from your inventory it is gone from the game.
10286 := Use the D-pad to highlight a desired item in your inventory and see its description. Press "A" to use this item on the character you are currently controlling.
10287 := You can only use items - like medpacs - on the character you are controlling. You can cycle through the party portraits with the black button to change the character you control.
10288 := When you press the [START] button the game will unpause and return to the main screen. Items will activate in the order that you selected them from your inventory.
10289 := I've got a feeling that won't be our last battle with the Sith. Good thing we have medpacs to heal our wounds. It might be a good idea to use one now before our next battle.
10290 := Now that the door's open you better take the lead again.
10291 := You always control the leader of the party. You can switch who is the party leader by pressing <blbutton>.
10292 := Press <blbutton> now to switch me to the party leader, then use me to open the door. Simply target the door, then press <abutton> to open it.
10293 := Okay, let's move out.
10294 := Because of the attack this room is in lockdown, but don't worry - I've got the override codes. You'll have to use me to unlock the door. 
10295 := You can access your journal, map and other important menus by pressing the [START] button.
10296 := You can then pull the left trigger to scroll through the menus listed on the tabs at the top of the screen.
10297 := The QUEST screen displays the entries in your electronic journal, including important quest information. Pressing "A" brings up more details about a highlighted entry.
10298 := You will hear a message alert whenever you get a new entry in your journal. Check the map and journal entries in your personal datapad before we continue, then talk to me again.
10299 := I've uploaded some information into your electronic journal.
10300 := Take a look at your journal before we go on. We need to be prepared for whatever the Sith throw at us.
10301 := Use the EQUIP screen to equip the armor and weapons from your inventory. You can access this by pressing the [START] button on your controller. 
10302 := Use the D-pad to cycle through your inventory slots. The menu on the right displays items you can equip in each slot. 
10303 := Press <abutton> to select an inventory slot, then scroll through the available items and press <abutton> to equip one. 
10304 := Remember - press [START] to access the EQUIP screen and pause the game. Pressing [START] again will unpause and return you to the main game. Speak to me after you equip your items.
10305 := Come on, we have to hurry! The Sith might already be boarding the ship to try and capture Bastila.
10306 := Put your equipment on so we can get out of here.
10307 := Now that you have your equipment you need to speak to me again. Use the triggers to cycle your targeting circle until it's on me then press "A".
10308 := Non-hostile creatures and objects will display a green selection reticle when targeted. Hostile creatures will show up as red. Press the "A" button to initiate dialog once you have me targeted.
10309 := Use the right thumbstick to control the camera and the left thumbstick to move towards your footlocker. Press <abutton> to open your locker once it is targeted.
10310 := Or you can pull the left and right triggers to cycle between targets until the footlocker is highlighted, then press <abutton> to open it.
10311 := You can target an object by facing it, or you can cycle the selection reticle between targets by pressing the D-pad. The camera automatically centers itself on the selected target.
10312 := The D-pad lets you scroll through the contents of an open container. Press "A" to pick up the contents. Everything inside will automatically be transferred to your inventory.
10313 := We've been ambushed by a Sith battle fleet! The Endar Spire is under attack! Hurry up - we don't have much time!
10314 := Did you fall out of your bunk and hit your head? The Endar Spire is the ship we're stationed on - this ship! You probably don't even know who I am, do you?
10315 := I'm Trask Ulgo, ensign with the Republic Fleet. I'm your bunk mate here on the Endar Spire. We work opposite shifts; I guess that's why you haven't seen me before.
10316 := Now hurry up, we have to find Bastila! We have to make sure she makes it off the ship alive!
10317 := You swore an oath to protect Bastila when you signed up with this mission, just like everyone else in the crew! Now it's time to make good on that oath.
10318 := I know she may not have an official rank in the fleet, but she's the one in charge of this mission and it's our duty to protect her!
10319 := Bastila's the commanding officer on the Endar Spire. Well, not an officer, really. But she's the one in charge of this mission.
10320 := You swore an oath to protect Bastila when you signed up with this mission, just like everyone else in the crew! Now it's time to make good on that oath.
10321 := One of our primary duties is to guarantee her survival in the event of enemy attack! You swore an oath just like everyone else on this mission. Now it's time to make good on that oath!
10322 := But now that you've signed on for this mission you're part of the Republic fleet. And Bastila needs all troops at her side during this attack!
10323 := I know you're a scout and not a soldier, but Bastila needs all troops at her side during this attack!
10324 := We're soldiers, we're trained for combat. Bastila's going to need men and women like us at her side during this attack!
10325 := Don't be stupid! You won't stand a chance against the Sith by yourself. We've got to stick together if we want to make it out of this alive.
10326 := So hurry up and grab your gear. You need to suit up so we can get out of here.
10327 := The Endar Spire? [Press <abutton> to select highlighted response.]
10328 := Who are you? [Press <abutton> to select highlighted response.]
10329 := Forget it - I'm looking after my own skin! [Press <abutton> to select highlighted response.]
10330 := Who's Bastila? [Press <abutton> to select highlighted response.]
10331 := Oath or no oath - I'm heading to the escape pods!
10332 := Okay, let's go help Bastila!
10333 := I'm a computer

10334 := You failed. I'm very sorry.
10335 := You did it, the room is filled with a deadly gas.

10337 := You failed. I'm very sorry.

10399 := Kashyyyk - Czerka Landing Port
10400 := Observation: You should have brought the Wookiee Zaalbar, despite the smell. He would have knowledge of this place, master. 
10401 := Answer: Agreed, but he is the most familiar with Kashyyyk. That is a simple fact.
10402 := Retort: "A long time" is still more frequent than "never," which is how many times the rest of us have been here, master.
10403 := Hmph. Maybe we should have brought the Wookiee out. This place looks... untamed.
10404 := Are you afraid of the wild, Mandalore? Are you a coward?
10405 := Mandalorians are not cowards! We're just practical.
10406 := It is always good to know as much as possible about a world, and to have a reliable guide. Perhaps we should get Zaalbar to accompany us.
10407 := As you will.
10408 := A reliable guide through the intricate complexities of another culture can be invaluable.
10409 := Perhaps you should reconsider leaving Zaalbar behind. This is, after all, his homeworld.
10410 := Is this about power, then? You would rather make a decision for the sake of making it than make it wisely?
10411 := I am only suggesting that both we and Zaalbar would benefit from his company while on Kashyyyk. You do want to find the Star Map, don't you?
10412 := We know very little of this planet. I also sense that Zaalbar has much that is unresolved here... it may be beneficial to aid him in this respect.
10413 := The Wookiee was looking pretty agitated back in the ship. You think it's wise to leave him unattended?
10414 := I agree, but he could prove useful. He'd certainly know the place. And I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on him.
10415 := He looked like there was something he needed to do. Besides, we don't know this planet. He could prove useful. 
10416 := Good or bad, he's got to have some interest in Kashyyyk. I'd rather have him with us.
10417 := Zaalbar should be here. He shouldn't miss this. He needs to know he can come back here.
10418 := I'm not saying that I know better than you, but this is Zaalbar's home. Don't you think he'd know some things?
10419 := Besides, he's got things here he needs to take care of.
10420 := I can't talk for Big Z, but believe me, he should be with us. He's got... unfinished business here.
10421 := Kashyyyk... my home. I should have prepared you for coming here... but I don't know if I've prepared myself.
10422 := Don't mock me, this is hard. Mission may have told you I was taken from here by slavers... but there is more.
10423 := I didn't leave Kashyyyk voluntarily. Mission must have told you how I was fleeing slavers... but there was more.
10424 := I am an exile. The slavers on Kashyyyk only took me after I was forced to leave my village home, 20 years ago.
10425 := Then stumble blindly. I won't speak of it again until it is in your face.
10426 := My brother made deals with the slavers and allowed them to get a foothold. I found out and attacked him.
10427 := The fight was stopped, but my father did not believe me when I told him about my brother's actions.
10428 := I was made an exile, disowned by my home and people. I should not be here. They will not accept me back.
10429 := The slavers are still here... this dock is theirs. I doubt anyone has risen to try and fight. Nothing has changed.
10430 := I just hope I can prove myself to my people. It will be difficult to make them listen. I just don't know.
10431 := When I attacked my brother I was so mad... I used my claws. You don't understand what that means to a Wookiee.
10432 := Our claws are tools, not weapons. To use them in battle is to become an animal. It is madness without honor.
10433 := I am forever a madclaw in the eyes of my people. Nothing I say is to be trusted. They were right to cast me out.
10434 := I don't have much hope.
10435 := I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
10436 := He has been away a long time.
10437 := I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
10438 := What do you mean?
10439 := I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
10440 := What do you mean?
10441 := I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
10442 := What do you mean?
10443 := I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
10444 := What do you mean?
10445 := It's a little late for warnings, fur ball.
10446 := Prepared me? What do you mean?
10447 := I don't care, I'll learn what I need myself.
10448 := Why were you forced to leave?
10449 := That's enough. I'll learn the rest on my own.
10450 := Time has passed. Things will have changed.
10451 := Why didn't your father believe you?
10452 := We'll deal with that if we have to. Let's go.
10453 := Don't bother me. You're on your own here.
10454 := I'm not paid to talk. Take it to the captain or the stiffs in the office.
10455 := I just carry a blaster. The captain does the talking.
10456 := Talk to the captain, not me.
10457 := Still here? Why do you keep bothering me? All our services are up near the docking area.
10458 := Fine then, move along.
10459 := Make it quick. I'm no information booth. Talk to Janos in the Czerka office.
10460 := Hold here, spacer. Czerka Corporation doesn't recommend traveling in wild Edean. Katarn attacks are especially bad right now.
10461 := Wookiee hunters usually keep numbers down, but I think they leave certain areas infested, just hoping a Czerka guard will get killed.
10462 := I won't stop you, but you leave this area at your own risk. We're here to protect the company, not you.
10463 := Go to Janos for company policy. I just man the gate to make sure people like you know you're on your own on the other side.
10464 := I don't talk to Wookiee-lovers. Get rid of your rug and maybe I won't have you shot.
10465 := I don't take kindly to threats. Don't test me, spacer, we've more than enough firepower to bury you here.
10466 := That's right you will. Now get moving.
10467 := Make it quick. I'm getting tired of you.
10468 := [Success] Ah, you ain't so bad. Was there anything else you needed?
10469 := [Failure] What are you doing? Are you making fun of me? Don't push your luck, fool.
10470 := What's to tell? They're big, powerful, difficult, and worth the most when caged and shipped off this forest-covered rock.
10471 := You're not some anti-slaver, are you? If so, go talk your crud somewhere else. I've seen guards ripped to shreds. They're animals.
10472 := Watch yourself out there. There won't be any rescue missions if you go missing.
10473 := Not anymore. Look, you want to know why the Wookiees are acting compliant, you go ask them.
10474 := When they rip your head off, we'll fish it out of the Shadowlands and give it a proper burial. How about that?
10475 := Shipped as slaves to work as soldiers and heavy laborers in Czerka camps, no doubt. 

10476 := That's horrible! You wouldn't talk like that if Big Z was here!
10477 := You're the Wookiee-lover, why don't you tell me about them? I'm sure you're real close friends.
10478 := Grraarrr!
10479 := Keep your pet on a leash or you'll be wearing him. I've no love for these animals. I've seen guards ripped to shreds.
10480 := Never mind. I'm leaving.
10481 := I have questions for you.
10482 := I'm going past you. I paid the landing fee.
10483 := Don't get in my way. You'll wind up dead.
10484 := What can you tell me about Czerka Corporation?
10485 := Maybe I should just let him rip your arms off.
10486 := Yes, yes, you're big and tough. I'll leave.
10487 := I meant nothing by it. Could you answer my questions?
10488 := Should I care? You are nothing to me.
10489 := [Force Persuade] You haven't warned me. I'm a nice person. You like me.
10490 := [Persuade] I'm just trying to get my bearings. I don't mean any harm.
10491 := What do you know about the Wookiees?
10492 := That's all. Goodbye.
10493 := So the Wookiees are fighting back?
10494 := You're probably here with the new restraining collars. I'm not handling another shipment without them.
10495 := Three restraining collars failed on the last shipment. The buyer was not pleased.
10496 := You'd think they'd be grateful to leave this barbaric place.
10497 := I wasn't aware we were giving tours now. Leave me.
10498 := Speak with the director if you need information. I only deal with volume buyers.
10499 := I don't have time to deal with you.
10500 := I don't deal with individual buyers. I'll have my broker contact your people. 
10501 := Please leave me. I've contracts to decipher.
10502 := Hello again. Czerka Corporation is seeing a lot of return business these days. We are the only company offering Wookiees.
10503 := Welcome to Edean. I trust you will find our facilities pass inspection. Czerka Corporation is very efficient.
10504 := Please, take any inquiries you have to director Janos. I must continue my work.
10505 := Farewell.
10506 := I'm sorry, but director Janos will see to your questions. I must continue with my work.
10507 := I'm conducting experiments on various samples of indigenous plant life. There may be untapped pharmaceutical resources here.
10508 := Of course, that will take some time, and the Wookiees are a more immediate source of income. Please, I must return to my work.
10509 := There's no call for that. I'm just a glorified lab technician. Please, the assignment is difficult enough.
10510 := Take your concerns to Janos. He's the one that runs things here. Not me.
10511 := You have nothing to be proud of, fool.
10512 := I'm sorry, I don't understand Wookieespeak. Shyriiwook, I think it's called? What did the Wookiee say?
10513 := I didn't say that!
10514 := What are you doing? Stop this!
10515 := Call him off! I don't have anything to do with what happens on this planet. I'm just a glorified lab technician!
10516 := What was that about? I don't like being used for your amusement.
10517 := Grrr... I remember.
10518 := I don't have much hope of that.
10519 := I suppose so... but their presence here is no joke.
10520 := I'm not sure I can answer. Janos is the spokesman for Czerka Coporation at this outpost.
10521 := I just work here in the lab. I... I don't have anything to do with the taking of slaves.
10522 := I don't have to justify myself to you. I do good work here. If you're looking for trouble, go somewhere else.
10523 := I'm just an employee. You'll have to take your concerns to Janos. He's the voice for Czerka Corporation on this outpost.
10524 := Czerka Corporation calls the planet Edean, and no, I don't understand the language. The local Wookiee leader has made it so we don't need to.
10525 := Wookiees are unable to speak basic, but for the last decade the residents of all local villages have been trained to understand it.
10526 := I understand he works very closely with Czerka Corporation. He wants his people to work well with us. It eases tensions.
10527 := It helps ease tensions. They are less hostile towards us if they understand what we say.
10528 := And it makes my people more desirable as slaves.
10529 := What did he say? I don't usually have a translator I can ask.
10530 := Just leave me alone. I don't want any trouble. The guards are trigger-happy as it is.
10531 := I can't talk now. I've got to pack. They'll be on us soon!
10532 := Goodbye for now.
10533 := I want to ask questions about this planet.
10534 := I'm asking you. Answer my questions, peon!
10535 := What is your job here?
10536 := You'll talk as long as I say, understand?
10537 := He wants to rip your legs off and beat you with them.
10538 := See? He's furious. I can barely control him.
10539 := Don't question me. Remember your life debt.
10540 := I'm just scaring him. Maybe he'll learn something.
10541 := What? Don't you want these fools to fear you?
10542 := Ignore him. I have some questions for you.
10543 := He said you have nothing to be proud of working for Czerka.
10544 := Whatever you say. I have some questions.
10545 := How convenient. All the benefits with no guilt.
10546 := Why don't you do anything to stop it?
10547 := You work on Kashyyyk and don't understand the language?
10548 := Why would a Wookiee leader do that?
10549 := What good would that do?
10550 := That knowing Basic just makes his people better slaves.
10551 := Watch yourself. We don't need anyone agitating the locals.
10552 := Take a walk, spacer. You don't look like a big buyer to me.
10553 := If you've business with Czerka Corporation, take it to the director's office.
10554 := Keep walking. This ain't no holiday port of call.
10555 := Czerka Corporation should burn down some trees. Make room for some swoop races.
10556 := This assignment is the worst in the galaxy.
10557 := You want to arrange a purchase, go talk to the director in his office.
10558 := Move along, spacer.
10559 := I think you'd better talk to Eli directly. He's the boss... for the time being.
10560 := Greetings to you. Something I can get for you?
10561 := Kindly direct your inquiries to me. Matton is merely an indebted employee. His opinions don't amount to much.
10562 := That Thaylian bog-slime. Do you know that I have been here 36 days, slaving to pay a debt in good faith?
10563 := All for nothing. He killed my crew... who knows where my ship is. Well, there's your pay, Eli. Blaster fire, and keep the change.
10564 := Well, I could have shot out his legs and let him crawl around for a while, but I consider this far more merciful.
10565 := What did you expect I'd do? Besides, he'd have killed me. He couldn't have risked me telling everyone he was a cheat. He'd have no business.
10566 := Well, there's not much for me to do but stay here. I've no ship, so I may as well make a few credits.
10567 := I suppose it does, though maybe I should keep it up for a while on my own. I've no ship at the moment anyway.
10568 := It'll probably take a while to convince Eli's suppliers that I'm the new boss, but eventually I'll buy my way off this rock.
10569 := That's the idea. Actually, I should toss you a few credits for helping me out. Take them... maybe even spend them here.
10570 := What do you mean? I don't need to go hunting Eli's family or anything. I've seen justice done.
10571 := All right then. Here, I should toss you a few credits for helping. I appreciate what you did.
10572 := [Success] Working here when I was trapped was hell enough. Staying here now is just foolish. I don't want to be seen as weak.
10573 := [Failure] I'd rather move on, you know? I don't want to be mad about this for the rest of my life. I can make this work.
10574 := [Success] You know, maybe you're right. Why should I bother with this remote hole? This isn't the life I wanted.
10575 := I see your point. I'll leave his shop like his corpse. I'll take what I want, buy passage on a ship, and never look back except to spit.
10576 := Here, take this. Thanks for reminding me about how he misused my trust. I'll make sure it never happens again. With anyone.
10577 := Well, that's your opinion, I guess, but I still owe you for helping me. Here, take a few credits with you. Spend them here, if you like.
10578 := Safe flying to you. Hope to see you again.
10579 := All right then. Actually, I feel I owe you something. Here, take a few credits. If you spend it here, all the better. I think things are looking up.
10580 := Hello again. Welcom back to Eli Gand's outpost, now under new management. What do you need?
10581 := Right you are.
10582 := Thanks for your help, friend. I'm getting off this planet as soon as I can. I'll pay my own way, too. No more debts to anyone.
10583 := No more trusting anyone, either. I've learned what that gets you.
10584 := Did you have to kill him?
10585 := What will you do now?
10586 := I suppose that closes his little outpost here.
10587 := And you won't owe anyone a single credit. Good luck.
10588 := If it were me, I'd wipe out all memory of him.
10589 := Never mind. Goodbye.
10590 := Fine, fine. Just show me what's for sale.
10591 := [Force Persuade] Remember your hatred. Don't trap yourself here.
10592 := [Persuade] It's not enough. This store was his life. Let it rot.
10593 := Sounds like a boring choice to me. Goodbye.
10594 := In that case, let's see what's for sale.
10595 := I don't want anything right now, thanks.
10596 := You're still here? I'd never be so forgiving.
10597 := Let's see what you have for sale.
10598 := Hello again. What can I do for you, most valued customer?
10599 := Valued until you can't pay. Watch your credits.
10600 := You hurt me, Matton. It is the debt of your crew that keeps you here, not me.
10601 := So, new spacers have come to wild Kashyyyk? Please, look well upon the wares of Eli Gand. I live to serve your needs.
10602 := Just be sure to pay cash. The interest on his loans will drain you like a Deluvian fatworm on a Hutt's backside.
10603 := First off, Hutts are ALL backside. Secondly, I don't much like the comparison. No need to get personal. It's just business.
10604 := Poor fellow, he's been waiting for his friends to return with my money for a standard month now. Ah, but you don't need to hear of this. What can I get you?
10605 := See you soon, I hope. Always open.
10606 := We're always open... for now, at least.
10607 := Enslave? I resent that. Simply fair business. This man's fellows left without settling their debts, so he must make up the difference.
10608 := I know, I know, it's standard trading rules. I just want to know where my crew went. I was only gone for two days. This isn't like them.
10609 := Yes, very sad that they would abandon you, especially while you were doing me a favor and helping repair one of my freighters.
10610 := You think you know someone, and they turn out to be a cheat. Oh, not like you, Matton. You honor your deals. A word is a bond in trade.
10611 := Of course. I am here to serve.
10612 := Oh, it isn't about the amount. After all, as a skilled mechanic, Matton is worth much more than what is owed. Especially on this remote planet.
10613 := Oh, you flatter me, Eli. I guess we're best buddies now.
10614 := *ahem* As I was saying, it's a matter of principle. I am nothing if not honest in my dealings, and I demand the same. 
10615 := He will be free to go when his friends turn up and the debt is paid. I honor my deals. Let no one say otherwise.
10616 := Thanks, but no thanks. No offense, but there's no point in exchanging debt to Eli with debt to you.
10617 := Besides, he is a hard worker. I'd prefer to keep him.
10618 := Ah, it happens from time to time. Credits are scarce out here, and not everyone is as honest as Mister Dasol here.
10619 := You'll get your money. My crew will be back.
10620 := Of course they will. Until then, however, I can make use of you as a mechanic. Very rare to find skills of your kind out here.
10621 := No, they're not. An honest man is pretty scarce, too, wouldn't you say?
10622 := An honest man and a good mechanic. Seems like you got a favorable trade, sir.
10623 := Something about this whole situation stinks worse than an overcrowded ronto stable! What kind of friends would just abandon a crew mate?
10624 := I don't concern myself with what goes on past this landing port. The Wookiees are *ahem*... very difficult to deal with. No business sense.
10625 := He means they don't tolerate cheats.
10626 := No, I mean they don't respect the finer points of a good business plan. Give and take. That is why the Czerka Corporation simply takes.
10627 := You'd have to take your questions to Czerka Corporation, and the Wookiees themselves. I keep to myself.
10628 := It is difficult indeed to deal with those you oppress and enslave.
10629 := No business sense? You mean they don't like to be cheated out of all their belongings and freedom.
10630 := You mean they don't tolerate cheats!
10631 := I know I'll be leaving soon. it's too unstable now. Maybe I could talk my way into dealing with the Wookiees, but it's risky.
10632 := Yeah, it turns out Wookiees don't want to be slaves. Like most people.
10633 := That's enough, Matton.
10634 := << Enter text here >>
10635 := Of course. You are in a hurry.
10636 := Certainly, though my stock may be a little thin. I'm having trouble with a trade contact on Korriban.
10637 := Have a look, but if you see kolto, the price is not negotiable. My prices have risen like everywhere else.
10638 := Yes, maybe I have something of interest. I know your tastes are fine. I recognize you as race champion of Manaan.
10639 := Where? Ah, you mean the lower forest? I don't pay attention to what these Wookiees call it. A droid you say? 
10640 := What... what kind of droid?
10641 := Now, now, Matton, it's likely just some old service droid lost by the Czerka Corporation. I wouldn't waste my time on it.
10642 := I really want to see this thing. This sounds very odd.
10643 := You get excited over hearsay. There is no droid, no proof of anything. Get back to work.
10644 := What? I'd really like to see this droid.
10645 := You startle my friend here needlessly. He has work to do and I won't have any more talk of this upsetting him. Understand?
10646 := I doubt it. I don't even want to look at it. I deal in trade of goods, not garbage.
10647 := Droid head? On Kashyyyk? Let me see that!
10648 := It is nothing, I'm certain. Eh... just garbage from the forest floor.
10649 := Mere rubbish? It's D-A02, the repair droid from my ship! What was this doing in the forest?
10650 := Eli, you snake! You said my crew jacked the ship without paying the repair bill! 
10651 := Oh, there will be a reward, all right. Eli! You told me my crew jacked our ship without paying the repair bill!
10652 := Well... that is... eh... it's not how it looks. You see, a good mechanic is hard to find and...
10653 := And what? I thought I owed you! You tricked them into the Shadowlands and killed them all while I fixed your freighter in orbit!
10654 := Now keep your head, Matton. It was just business.
10655 := This is business? Maybe in Hutt Space, but not here! Not with me!
10656 := You outsiders even cheat each other! No wonder you give no thought to my people!
10657 := Whatever your Wookiee is saying, he's not helping diffuse the situation. This is just a simple business matter.
10658 := I've no business with you. I'll be going.
10659 := Do you always enslave your debtors?
10660 := I want to go back to my other questions.
10661 := How much debt buys a man's life?
10662 := Perhaps I could settle some of his debt?
10663 := Do your debtors have a habit of running off?
10664 := What do you know of Kashyyyk?
10665 := What do you mean by that?
10666 := Let me see what you carry.
10667 := I found a droid in the Shadowlands. Is it yours?
10668 := It recorded a very suspicious incident.
10669 := It had been damaged in some sort of ambush.
10670 := Could it be worth something?
10671 := I found this droid head. Can I ask you about it?
10672 := It recorded an ambush. Someone yells Eli's name.
10673 := What do I care? Is there a reward?
10674 := Greetings again. How can Czerka Corporation serve you during your visit to Edean?
10675 := I'm sorry, but I have no information on that. Are you sure you meant to come here? This world is very primitive.
10676 := Czerka Corporation has branches in many systems, mostly concerned with weapon production for personal and ship-mounted use.
10677 := Of course, the many outposts on this world are only concerned with bio-aquisitions.
10678 := G5-623 is the numerical designation. The galactic Basic name is "Edean," chosen by corporate ballot among stockholders.
10679 := At any rate, "Edean" is more pleasing than "Kashyyyk." The language of the dominant indigenous species is quite crude.
10680 := In fact, a translation droid must usually be placed with them, but their physical strength makes up for the inconvenience to the owner.
10681 := An endless array of dangerous creatures, it seems. The great trees harbor any number of dangers below.
10682 := We've detected odd energy signatures on occasion, but exploration is costly amongst creatures even more difficult than Wookiees.
10683 := We send expeditions, of course, but they come back with little, if they come back at all.
10684 := Odd energy signatures? Have you ever checked those out?
10685 := It would seem you are already acquainted with this world, given your choice of traveling companion.
10686 := I have been away for a very long time.
10687 := You let the beast speak for you? You allow it more liberties than most of our customers.
10688 := I've a very limited number of things I can say. What do you wish to discuss?
10689 := Very good, feel free to inspect our operation here, but I would advise against going too far from the main landing area.
10690 := The planet is still very much untamed, and we do not send out patrols for lost tourists.
10691 := Oh, just say the word!
10692 := It's not up to you. This planet is not a member of the Republic, and its backward citizens hold no rights.
10693 := I'm sorry you are offended, but this operation is very humane. Even the Wookiee leadership knows it is more beneficial to work with us.
10694 := Besides, even if you did do something drastic here, the Czerka Corporation has other outposts on Edean. It would change nothing.
10695 := Humane, you call it? Beneficial? Sounds like a bunch of excuses, if you ask me.
10696 := It's not our place to judge, Carth. As he said, it would change nothing anyway.
10697 := Are you saying you approve of this?!
10698 := Of course not. I would gladly end it, had I the power. However, we are here for other reasons, if you will recall.
10699 := Slavery under any guise should not be tolerated!
10700 := For material goods, I would suggest you speak with the general vendor near the docking area. He keeps his store well-stocked.
10701 := They charge fair value for mundane goods and armor. If it is weapons you want, you will need to deal with the Czerka representative. That would be me.
10702 := If you're here to purchase local species, however, you must wait for a licensed Czerka Corporation trader to return from deliveries outside the system.
10703 := Aren't you here to take delivery of a Wookiee thrall? There are few other reasons to visit this barbaric world.
10704 := We do things as humanely as possible. There are other outposts, but the operation is very lean overall.
10705 := He means that they are slavers. They take my people from their homes and sell them to the highest bidder.
10706 := Your current Wookiee seems displeased with the situation, but I fail to see a concern. You seem to be a satisfied customer.
10707 := It is not me, personally. I merely represent Czerka Corporation at this outpost. There are other directors at other stations, of course.
10708 := Arrangements have been made with the Wookiee leadership. Harvesting is handled as delicately as possible, relatively speaking.
10709 := Ah, a very difficult thing to stage. I commend you for it. So much easier than relying on restraining collars.
10710 := Do not demean the life-debt! Do not!
10711 := I must warn you that you will be blamed for the actions of your Wookiee. Please... call him off.
10712 := I am merely a servant of the corporation! The Wookiee leadership is in agreement! Harvesting is made as delicate as possible!
10713 := Please! It is not my decision! It is... an acceptable practice, I assure you!
10714 := I will answer if I can.
10715 := Now, there's no c-call for that. It is a simple matter, really. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.
10716 := We are kept profitable and an agreeable leader is kept in power. It keeps the process from becoming a constant firefight.
10717 := I believe his name is Chuundar. I don't deal directly with them, thank goodness. Far too brutish.
10718 := I don't know why you asked me these questions, but it doesn't matter. Chuundar is unquestioned as leader. Our operation is quite secure.
10719 := RrrrraaAAAARRRR!!!
10720 := [Success] I can tell you about the agreement. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees. 
10721 := [Failure] It's not good policy to talk about our corporate strategy. I'm sorry, but I can't say any more.
10722 := [Success] If it will ease your temper, I will give specifics. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.
10723 := Commentary: The meatbag speaks without clarity. Detail this agreement or the master will splatter your organs all over the floor!
10724 := Maybe you should start talking, or I might decide to get a little... restless.
10725 := [Force Persuade] You wish to tell us more about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.
10726 := [Force Persuade] You wish to tell us more about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.
10727 := [Force Persuade] Hmph. 'Harvesting'. Tell us about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.
10728 := Please, follow me to my office in our information center. We will discuss your needs and how Czerka Corporation can serve you.
10729 := I greet you again. Will you accept the terms of landing at this outpost? We are quite far from any similar services.
10730 := Greetings to you. Err... while I am pleased to welcome you to planet G5-623, I do not see your ship on my docking schedule.
10731 := The Czerka Corporation will see to your needs, of course, but there will be a 100 credit docking fee. In advance, I fear.
10732 := I respect your... obvious determination, but I can't allow you to remain unless you pay the proper fees.
10733 := The Czerka Corporation appreciates your cooperation, and hopes this will not devolve into a... violent matter.
10734 := W-we are not unarmed here! We have many guards and security droids. If we can control Wookiees, we can control you.
10735 := [Failure] I fail to see the basis for your arguement. Please, there is no need to be hostile.
10736 := This outpost is remote and expensive to maintain. The 100 credits given will ensure that it remains here... for your use, of course.
10737 := Upon collection of the correct fees, I will extend what resources the Czerka Corporation can offer. I'm sure you understand.
10738 := Very simply put, no. Operation of these remote outposts is an expensive endeavor.
10739 := [Success] Perhaps you don't need to pay the docking fee. Any services you need will more than make up for it.
10740 := [Failure] No... no I'm... quite certain that you need to pay the fee. It is a mere 100 credits, after all.
10741 := [Success] *sigh* Normally I wouldn't do this, but I don't feel like arguing. I'll consider a promise of future business payment enough.
10742 := Czerka Corporation protects its interests. If you won't pay, you won't be granted access to the planet and are free to leave.
10743 := I will await you here if you change your mind.
10744 := That is unfortunate. This outpost will have to remain closed to you until you can secure the credits. I am sorry. Good day.
10745 := You are welcome on Edean, trade designation G5-623. Czerka Corporation welcomes your business. We should discuss your interests in my office.
10746 := We will also arrange for translation services, for a nominal fee, of course. You'll be encountering a number of Wookiees while here.
10747 := I see you have a Wookiee with you. Can I assume you understand their language? For a fee, Czerka Corporation can provide a translator for you during your visit.
10748 := Er... very well. It is no concern of mine. I will simply assume you are one of the rare sort that take to languages easily.
10749 := Very well, though only the most adaptive people seem to comprehend the Wookiee language, such as it is.
10750 := I don't have any experience with that. I just know that only the most adaptive people can understand the Wookiee language.
10751 := Now then, please follow me to our information center. I will answer any further questions there.
10752 := Well, we are limited in many ways, but I doubt you will find even basic facilities anywhere else in this remote sector.
10753 := That is what the dominant indigenous species calls this world, but maintaining this outpost grants Czerka Corporation naming rights in the trade guides.
10754 := But, I'm sorry, I really must insist that docking fees be paid before I impart any further services. I must follow proper procedure.
10755 := Farewell for now.
10756 := I'm looking for something called a Star Map.
10757 := I'd like to ask about the Czerka Corporation.
10758 := Bio-acquisitions? What do you mean?
10759 := Tell me about the planet. You called it G5-623 before.
10760 := What else is on this planet?
10761 := What did you mean when you referred to a Wookiee's "owner?"
10762 := To the owner? What do you mean?
10763 := I'd like to talk about the slaving operations here on Edean.
10764 := I'm through speaking with you for now.
10765 := What's to stop me turning my Wookiee loose on you?
10766 := I can't allow this to continue.
10767 := Allow it more liberties? What do you mean?
10768 := I need supplies. What is available here?
10769 := Purchase local species? What do you mean?
10770 := I'd think you would need more firepower to keep order.
10771 := Disgusting slaver! Why shouldn't I kill you!
10772 := Why do the Wookiees tolerate you doing this?
10773 := Zaalbar is no slave. He has pledged a life-debt to me.
10774 := Why? I should let him kill the lot of you!
10775 := I've other questions to ask.
10776 := Tell me what you mean or I'll bloody your floor!
10777 := What is this leader's name?
10778 := [Force Persuade] You want to tell me about these agreements.
10779 := [Persuade] Tell me about it. I might be more understanding if I know.
10780 := Don't make demands. I'm <FullName>, and I'll land where I wish.
10781 := It's easily settled. I'll pay with your blood!
10782 := [Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the docking fee. Stand aside!
10783 := Docking fee? Why do I need to pay that?
10784 := Is the price negotiable?
10785 := [Force Persuade] I don't think I need to pay the docking fee.
10786 := [Persuade/Lie] I represent wealthy clients. You should let me pass.
10787 := I refuse to pay. What will you do about it?
10788 := I can't pay you the 100 credits.
10789 := Very well, I will pay the 100 credit fee.
10790 := I understand more than you can know.
10791 := That will not be necessary.
10792 := I'm trained in the Force. I'll have no trouble.
10793 := What services does 100 credits get me?
10794 := Could I get some information about the planet? I thought this was Kashyyyk.
10795 := Death to all slavers! Kashyyyk will be free!
10796 := The outsiders will pay for how they dishonored us!
10797 := At last, we will push them off our beloved Kashyyyk!
10798 := The Shadowlands are too good for them! We'll kill them all!
10799 := These Czerka animals will die by sword and bowcaster!
10800 := Let their blood feed out forests! That will be their payment!
10801 := Let no one escape! They must learn the price we place on dishonor!
10802 := Kashyyyk will be ours once more!
10803 := You are the only outsider that will survive us! We swear it!
10804 := Czerka will never come back here, we will make certain!
10805 := We will remember what happend here. Slavers will not take us again.
10806 := If another company comes to Kashyyyk, they will find it impossible to do what Czerka did.
10807 := It will be a long time before we allow ourselves to be as weak as Chuundar made us.
10808 := Your presence is tolerated because of how you helped us, outsider.
10809 := Thank you for your assistance, outsider. I doubt we will meet another of your kind like you.
10810 := We will guard this landing place from now on. Yours is the only ship that will be allowed to dock here for a long time, outsider.
10811 := Our work here could be very important if any effort was put into it.
10812 := Local fauna is amazing. If I could isolate why the trees grow so big, it would be worth more than a thousand Wookiee slaves.
10813 := I think Czerka is missing an opportunity here. The forest could teach us so much.
10814 := The payoff from research is too much of a risk for Czerka to spend much money on it. Slaves are proven commodities.
10815 := There is so much to learn about this planet, but they keep us cooped up in here.
10816 := I do my job and keep my mouth shut. Maybe I can do some good if I stay out of people's way.
10817 := Don't bother me, now. I've got twice as many Wookiees to process as usual.
10818 := Hey! Don't get too close to the cages. Even these cowed Wookiees will take your arm off if they get the chance.
10819 := Heh, if we keep exporting at this rate, the only planet in the sector with no Wookiees will be their home world.
10820 := You know, I hear Czerka has negotiated to increase its presence here by six more outposts.
10821 := I heard the Wookiee leader is saying we can increase the number of slaves we take. I think Czerka will be here a long time.
10822 := I hear the Wookiees seem to be cooperating even more than usual now. Czerka can pretty much do whatever it wants.
10823 := Hey, business is better than ever. These animals will pay our way for years.
10824 := Hey, we just got word that shipments will be increasing. This Chuundar really knows how to do business.
10825 := You know, every Czerka outpost is expected to double the number of Wookiees they take in the next year.
10826 := Wookiees settle down a lot once they're caged.
10827 := It took ten days for news of Taris to reach me. They don't tell us anything.
10828 := I guess I should be grateful I'm on Kashyyyk. I could have been posted to Taris.
10829 := All those people on Taris dead. First I heard the whole planet was gone, but even just the city is sad.
10830 := Have you heard where the Sith might be headed next? I don't even know why they targetted Taris.
10831 := We get the occasional private trader from Korriban through here, but not recently. I wonder what's up.
10832 := Have you been by Korriban recently? The Sith there aren't planning on taking their trouble off-world, are they?
10833 := I heard something about trouble with Sith on Korriban, but as long as no cities are being destroyed, they can do what they like.
10834 := I don't mind being on a backwater planet when I hear about the trouble places like Korriban get.
10835 := You look a lot like the winner of the Manaan races. I bet that opens door for you.
10836 := I heard some rookie took the big prize at the Manaan swoop races. I guess anyone can win now that Taris is gone.
10837 := Is your ship equipped to get the major planetary broadcasts? I heard the Manaan races were pretty good.
10838 := Are you... no, there's no way a swoop champion is on Kashyyyk. No way.
10839 := If we don't get another shipment of kolto, we'll have to start using local herbs for healing. Then we'll hurt *and* stink.
10840 := Bring those Selkath here see if they think we need kolto. They'd start shipping it out quick, I bet.
10841 := This planet is the worst assignment to have with a kolto shortage coming up.
10842 := Czerka is making us put a deposit on standard issue kolto packs. I know the cost has gone up, but come on.
10843 := Another time, human. I wish you well on this world.
10844 := Greetings again to you, human. It would seem the call of the hunt has brought us both to this troubled world.
10845 := I have not been here long, but I can already see I will not be as welcome here as I had hoped. 
10846 := It was a hard decision, but I felt I had no other choice. I had done a disservice to the apex predator of that world. It was time to go.
10847 := While I'm sure you would prove an interesting hunt, I don't track sentient prey. Two-legged animals do a fine job of killing each other without me.
10848 := I have come here to seek even greater prey than what we faced on Tatooine, but the climate here is politically cold, and I don't know if I will be allowed to hunt.
10849 := Farewell. Perhaps we will meet again. A great hunt on this world would be glorious.
10850 := I know that I don't know enough. Even from this docking area I can see this world is a true wonder. My desert-dimmed imagination didn't do it justice.
10851 := It's just a shame to see Czerka Corporation here. They lack an appreciation for the wild nature of this world. I don't like having to deal with them.
10852 := The native leadership of the Wookiees, of course. This is their world, after all. I can't understand why thy have allowed it to be misused.
10853 := There is always the option to fight, even if there is no option to win. Of course, that is easy for me to say, being an outsider.
10854 := I would hope they are not complicit in the enslaving of their world, but it is not my place to judge. I have only just arrived.
10855 := Perhaps they had no choice.
10856 := No, but I wasn't listening for such talk. I'm sorry that I can't help you.
10857 := An astute question. Czerka Corporation seems in control here, but they don't care if I wander the Shadowlands, so long as I have paid their docking fee.
10858 := Instead, I hope to gain the trust of the native Wookiee population. I'm not here to just kill the biggest thing I can find; I want to understand how they hunt.
10859 := Very little. I'm sure they have had enough of off-worlders like the Czerka claiming good intentions. I will simply try to stay out of their way.
10860 := I have heard of an off-worlder that has gained respect by living in the Shadowlands for some years. Perhaps I will attempt the same. It could just be hunter tales, though.
10861 := Why did you leave your home on Tatooine?
10862 := What are you doing here, Komad? Following me?
10863 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
10864 := What do you know of Kashyyyk?
10865 := If not Czerka, who would you prefer to deal with?
10866 := I'm looking for a Star Map here. Have you heard anything?
10867 := Whose permission are you looking for?
10868 := What are you doing to gain their trust?

10951 := I never thought I'd see the big trees. Zaalbar's stories didn't do it justice. This is incredible.
10952 := I wish he was here to see this. He'd want to see this, you know?
10953 := Can you sense it? The wind... the sound... the smells? I feel it all now that we are away from the spaceport.
10954 := This walkway is new, probably built by the slavers, but I remember the trees. My village is not far from here.
10955 := Yes, your outsider concerns must always come first. Just remember that this was my home. You are the stranger here.
10956 := I must warn you of one thing... I don't know if I will be a help or hindrance to you here. My father was very powerful... a chieftain.
10957 := Perhaps his feelings have mellowed, but if my brother had his ear all this time... I may be very unwelcome.
10958 := I'm not asking you to deal with anything. I just wanted you to know about potential problems.
10959 := Bah, do what you want with this information. I won't say any more about it.
10960 := That is what I am dreading. My shame was meant to be forgotten on some far away world. I never thought I'd come back.
10961 := I'm sorry, I've taken enough of your time. We should press on.
10962 := It is kind of you to offer, but my problems are very personal. I'm not sure if I am ready to deal with them.
10963 := I'm sorry, I don't know. It has been so long since I left. I only know the way things were, and many things may have changed.
10964 := We're here for the Star Map. Nothing else, understand?
10965 := I don't have time for your family squabbles.
10966 := We'll deal with that when the time comes.
10967 := Is there anything I can help you with?
10968 := What can I expect to encounter?
10969 := Why do you bother us again, outsider? We have nothing to say to you.
10970 := What do you want, outsider? I won't let you follow us on our hunt. Chorrawl is not here for your amusement.
10971 := Feh! I'll believe that when our planet is free of you. Your kind are here only to take or destroy.
10972 := Why would you listen to me? Your kind have only been interested in caging or killing us.
10973 := You can't push me into battle, outsider. I know what happens to Wookiees that are said to be "difficult."
10974 := I won't be your trophy, dead or as a slave. Leave me. You have no place here.
10975 := You do that. Walk quickly, outsider. Kashyyyk fights back, even if we can't.
10976 := Your kind threaten my very planet. I live with it daily. Why should your words now goad me into battle?
10977 := No, I won't fight you. At best, my warrior comrades would slaughter you, only for ships to burn our homes later.
10978 := Go away, rabid fool. I won't listen to you anymore.
10979 := [Success] I... I should answer your questions... yes, perhaps one or two.
10980 := [Failure] You Czerka slavers, caring about nothing except what you want... what you can take!
10981 := You disgust me. Your scent poisons the air. Your feet foul the ground. Go away, outsider. Go away.
10982 := [Success] Hmm... only a moment, outsider. I won't be this patient for long.
10983 := Yes, go, and don't expect a friendly welcome if you return. This world is my home, not yours.
10984 := I don't concern myself with outsider toys. Search where you will, I'm not wasting my time.
10985 := You taunt me with a foolish question like that. How do you think? My people go missing or die.
10986 := We can't fight back. Chuundar has bartered to reduce the slaves taken, but if any Czerka die, it increases again.
10987 := How has my world fared? It is slowly dying.
10988 := Big Z once told me he had seen paradise destroyed by the greed of outsiders. I never understood what he meant until now.
10989 := Why do you not do something about this tyranny, then?
10990 := Why not do something about it, then?
10991 := He is our Chieftain and will be obeyed. That is our way. Whether I trust what he says or not doesn't matter.
10992 := In time, someone will replace him. For better or worse, I don't know. That will be for Bacca to decide.
10993 := Bacca was our greatest warrior. His ancient sword is the tool of ascension, the mark of a chieftain.
10994 := Chuundar no longer displays it, not since he took the role of chieftain years ago. If someone else could produce it...
10995 := Bah! I talk like a mere child! This is foolishness.
10996 := It truly would take Bacca's Blade for that to happen. Chuundar is the last member of his family.
10997 := There were others, but they were marked with madness. We don't speak their names. They are without honor.
10998 := The only crazed creature I know of is one of your kind, outsider, not mine. We see him from time to time.
10999 := We leave him alone. He has our respect because he has braved the lands alone. Sometimes he helps lone travelers. He is crazy, though.
11000 := Our finest warriors hunt the Shadowlands in groups, yet he lives there alone. Avoid him. Madness is to be feared.
11001 := Many years. It is impossible to know how many. A decade? Two? Perhaps he can answer your questions. Or kill you.
11002 := Hmph! I merely have an appreciation for solitude.
11003 := Ha! You claim to be a legend, but I'd know the mad hermit if I saw him. 3-meters tall, with eyes of madness.
11004 := Chuundar! Bah! Why should I care if you act for him when he does not act for us?
11005 := Hold your tongue. You speak of the Chieftain.
11006 := Yes, you would say that. You have lost no one to slavers. Chuundar has bought you.
11007 := No, not to you. You are an outsider and only care about our weaknesses. I won't say anything to you.
11008 := I am done with you, outsider. Go away. I won't be your entertainment.
11009 := I don't mean you any harm.
11010 := Could I ask some questions?
11011 := Don't test me, Wookiee. I go where I wish.
11012 := I will leave you then.
11013 := Show me proper respect or you'll regret it!
11014 := [Force Persuade] I want you to answer my questions.
11015 := [Persuade] Just a few questions. I'm a friend.
11016 := I will leave you now.
11017 := I seek an ancient Star Map. Have you seen it?
11018 := How has Kashyyyk fared under the Czerka Corporation?
11019 := What do you think of Chuundar?
11020 := How will Bacca decide? What does that mean?
11021 := Could a blood relative of Chuundar challenge him?
11022 := Do you know of a crazed Wookiee in the Shadowlands?
11023 := How long has he been down there?
11024 := I am <FullName>, and I act for Chuundar.
11025 := Explain what you meant by that.
11026 := Well, it seems you are more than I thought. Freyyr has come back, and told me of what you did for him.
11027 := My fellow hunters split on what should be done. Some were loyal to Chuundar alone... we had to fight.
11028 := Freyyr went to the throne room to challenge Chuundar. I will take you to him now.
11029 := Yes, much is about to be decided. Only one can lead us. *Must* lead us. Come.
11030 := We follow the Chieftain, whoever that is. If the position is in doubt, we each fight for the side we believe in.
11031 := This must be decided quickly or there will be much more bloodshed. Come, it is this way.
11032 := I can guide you off the path. We will approach from behind, avoiding Czerka and those loyal to Chuundar.
11033 := It is the only way. I'm sorry, but I won't allow you to proceed any other way. This is too important.
11034 := Lead on. We should hurry.
11035 := You fought each other? Why?
11036 := Why should I follow you?
11037 := You want to talk, do it with Patrol Captain Dehno. He's the ranking officer in this unit.
11038 := We should just say it bolted, or something.
11039 := They won't miss one, will they?
11040 := Why do they always have to be so difficult?
11041 := Well, this means extra duty for sure.
11042 := I thought he said shoot. I swear he said shoot.
11043 := You know, we're gonna get stuck with the bill for this.
11044 := The patrol Captain will speak for us. He's the ranking officer in this unit.
11045 := Wow. This is going to look really bad on my record.
11046 := What are you doing back here? Look, you got what you wanted, so just let us get back to corralling these animals.
11047 := What is it now? If you don't mind, I have important matters to discuss with my patrol.
11048 := This isn't good. I can't afford this.
11049 := You think I can? Do you know what they get for a healthy one of these things?
11050 := We'll work it out later. We've got company.
11051 := What do you want, spacer? I'm Patrol Captain Dehno and you're interrupting Czerka Corporation business.
11052 := Good. Watch yourself. These old paths are dangerous.
11053 := You mean Edean? Backwater world.
11054 := There are a few patrols in the lower areas, but I haven't heard what they are after.
11055 := The company has branches on many planets. I'm just a Patrol Captain. It's not my job to monitor it all.
11056 := If you want quotes on policy, get someone else. I just escort the slaves and guard this area.
11057 := This Wookiee slave got a little... rebellious. We had to put it down.
11058 := That's right! We had to do it and it shouldn't come out of our pay.
11059 := Just shut up, you trigger-happy idiot.
11060 := No, of course they don't. Why would you ask me that? Are you doing some sort of snap inspection?
11061 := You're trying to get me to admit to incompetence, aren't you? Not going to happen. I stand by my patrol.
11062 := This Wookiee got out of hand and *had* to be put down. We'll find another easy enough. 
11063 := Well... all right then. Carry on. We've work to do here.
11064 := Thanks for taking care of that, Captain.
11065 := You shut up. I'm not done with you two.
11066 := Is that a joke? Who do you think you are?
11067 := [Success] I... I think I should pull in some favors and... get us moved off-world, men.
11068 := Uh, are you all right, Captain?
11069 := Are you questioning my orders? You don't want to do that.
11070 := [Success] You make some sense. I wonder, what do you know about what might happen here?
11071 := Men, I think we should petition for a transfer. The corporation will survive a fight here, but us frontline guards won't.
11072 := If... you say so, Captain.
11073 := Yes, I say so. Move out. This place just isn't worth the trouble.
11074 := What the...? Blasters ready, men! This fool wants to die!
11075 := It... is a bit costly. Look, why are you asking this?
11076 := [Success] I... I think I should probably pay you so this stays off my record. Yes, that's best.
11077 := Uh, Captain.... what's going on? Is this one of those inspector shake-downs?
11078 := [Failure] What are you trying to get away with here? You can't just walk up and start demanding things.
11079 := I think this troublemaker needs an accident. In fact, I think this Wookiee attacked this fool and we arrived just a little too late to help.
11080 := Uh, Captain, we have blasters. Don't Wookiees use those bowcaster things?
11081 := Would you just shut up and shoot?
11082 := And who are you to stop us, little man?
11083 := [Success] What... you're a Czerka inspector, aren't you! Slimy little... I've heard about these shake-downs.
11084 := Give it up, men. If we don't pay this leech we'll get a black mark on our records a sunspot couldn't burn off.
11085 := But I, I... if you say so, sir. I don't think we have enough... here.
11086 := You are making this difficult. You know, maybe it's too much trouble to pay you. Maybe there's a better way.
11087 := Yes, I'm sure it will be. If I see anything on our records I'll have you fed to a katarn. In bite-sized chunks.
11088 := Now, if you don't mind, we have a patrol to get back to.
11089 := You lied to gain profit from the death of this Wookiee? You may as well have killed him yourself.
11090 := So I see.
11091 := Uh, if we're done here, we have a patrol to get back to. 
11092 := You can't justify this. Don't try.
11093 := Put it down? You killed him, you mean.
11094 := Put it down? You... you murdered him?
11095 := You murdered him!
11096 := You "put *it* down"? We're not animals!
11097 := Careful now... that growl sounded pretty threatening. Keep your slave on its leash or we'll have another accident.
11098 := I'm leaving. Never mind.
11099 := I have questions about Kashyyyk.
11100 := Tell me about Czerka Corp.
11101 := My name is <FullName>. What happened here?
11102 := Do your superiors approve of you killing Wookiees?
11103 := I don't actually care, one way or another.
11104 := I won't allow you to enslave or kill another Wookiee.
11105 := [Force Persuade] Request a transfer. Move your patrol off-world.
11106 := [Persuade] This posting is trouble, friend. Get out while you can.
11107 := It doesn't matter. I'll end your miserable life where you stand!
11108 := This may cost you more than you know, fool.
11109 := [Force Persuade] You want to pay me so this stays off your record.
11110 := [Persuade/Lie] You know why. Hand over compensation or this gets reported.
11111 := I'll just take it from your corpse then!
11112 := I demand more!
11113 := That will be fine. Thank you.
11114 := Shut up. I do as I wish.
11115 := I can't change what they did. Why not profit?

11129 := Greetings again, outsider. I will transport you to the Shadowlands if you wish. Chuundar wills it.
11130 := Rrrgh. Chuundar has commanded that I grant you access to the Shadowlands. Gorwooken is what I am called.
11131 := Walk with care! Only our bravest return from these lands. Your soft feet are a barely tolerated insult.
11132 := I will wait. Chuundar bids it.
11133 := The descent is long. Be still, or we will attract... unwelcome visitors.
11134 := Chuundar said nothing of answering your questions. Be brief.
11135 := A few like you are in the Shadowlands, given premission by Chuundar. I don't know why. Only Wookiees should be allowed.
11136 := The journeys of my people are very personal. I won't speak of them to an outsider.
11137 := You can't. You must live here to understand, to see harmony in the danger. Bah, I waste my breath on you.
11138 := [Failure] Eughh... my head hurts... hurry up and be on your way, outsider. 
11139 := [Success] Ergh... I should tell you about some of us that have gone to the Shadowlands. There have been many...
11140 := Latest was Rorworr, and he has not returned in many days. He may have died below, but he was strong and able.
11141 := Many have died recently. Chuundar believes one of our own is below, mad, crazed, killing all. I do not know.
11142 := We find no bodies to examine. The Shadowlands claim them, I am sure.
11143 := [Failure] This isn't for you to know. I'm done talking about it.
11144 := [Success] You ask very respectfully. Outsiders never do that. I suppose I can mention some of us that have entered the Shadowlands.
11145 := For reasons I do not know, Chuundar allows those of the Czerka to move in the Shadowlands. They kill much.
11146 := And there is another, but he has earned respect. He does not disturb our lives or customs. And he gets angry like a Wookiee sometimes.
11147 :=  Urgh... his name hurts my tongue. He has lived alone in the Shadowlands for many years now.
11148 := Be brief. I am not your guide.
11149 := That would be me. Jolee Bindo. Do I really look so different up close?
11150 := No, it cannot be you. You are too frail and old. The other is mad like a crazed tach.
11151 := Those that walk the Shadowlands do so at their own risk. It is a test of bravery among my people. A respected feat.
11152 := But you come here like the Czerka, with strange weapons. It is so much more than we have, yet you still fear?
11153 := You are pathetic. You will get no warnings from me. Prove your worth, to us and to yourself.
11154 := They have made Chuundar strong, so we are all stronger, but I do not like them. They are small and hide behind armor.
11155 := They would not survive the Shadowlands as a true Wookiee. They are not worthy to be there, but Chuundar wills it.
11156 := I'm not ready yet. I'll go down later.
11157 := Just unlock the thing and lower me down.
11158 := I have a few questions, Gorwooken.
11159 := Has anyone else been allowed down recently?
11160 := I want to understand why Wookiees revere the Shadowlands.
11161 := [Force Persuade] Tell me about any Wookiees that have recently gone this way.
11162 := [Persuade] Tell me of the Wookiees so I might show proper respect.
11163 := What outsiders are below?
11164 := Back to my other questions now.
11165 := I want to ask if it's dangerous down there.
11166 := What do you think of the Czerka Corporation?
11167 := [Having seen Gorwooken use the basket, you understand it well-enough to operate it.]
11168 := [You leave the basket as it is.]
11169 := [The basket begins to descend into the darkness.]
11170 := [I don't need this right now.]
11171 := [Go down to the Shadowlands.]
11172 := Speak with Chorrawl if you must speak at all. He knows your jagged language best.
11173 := Death to all slavers! Kashyyyk will be free!
11174 := The outsiders will pay for how they dishonored us!
11175 := At last, we will push them off our beloved Kashyyyk!
11176 := The Shadowlands are too good for them! We'll kill them all!
11177 := These Czerka animals will die by sword and bowcaster!
11178 := Let their blood feed out forests! That will be their payment!
11179 := Let no one escape! They must learn the price we place on dishonor!
11180 := Kashyyyk will be ours once more!
11181 := You are the only outsider that will survive us! We swear it!
11182 := Czerka will never come back here, we will make certain!
11183 := Grrrowwlll!! You are not permitted to pass into the Shadowlands. Only Chuundar may allow you entry.
11184 := Speak with Chuundar in the village of Rwookrrorro. He will decide if you are worthy.
11185 := Chuundar has said you may pass into the Shadowlands. Gorwooken will lower you down in the elevator basket.
11186 := Gorwooken climbed to the basket from the upper branches, but you will have to walk, outsider.
11187 := The path is seldom used. There may be vermin nesting along it. Be ready to fight.
11188 := By order of Chieftain Freyyr, you are allowed full access to the Shadowlands and our village. You have our thanks, outsider.
11189 := Chuundar has said that you can remain here, but watch where you step while in our village, outsider.
11190 := Freyyr has returned to us because of you, outsider. You are one of the few outsiders we will allow to remain among us in the village. 
11191 := GRRROWLLL, stop where you are, outsider. You enter the domain of Chuundar, Chieftain and leader!
11192 := He will decide if you are fit to walk the village of Rwookrrorro. You've already soiled our world with what you brought on your ship.
11193 := Look about you, fool. You face a legion of Wookiees in their home terrain! It is a losing fight for you.
11194 := You will be taken before Chuundar and he will judge your worth, and punishment for the taint you have returned to us.
11195 := He is right. There are too many. Please, let us go to Chuundar. He has much to explain.
11196 := The choice is made for you already! You make a demand for something you can't alter, can't help!
11197 := Chuundar sent us to search it. We found the exile. The nameless mad-claw, once called Zaalbar.
11198 := He means me. I am the taint that you have brought back.
11199 := Shut up! GROWWLL! You are nameless with dishonor, mad-claw! Yours is a foulness that disgusts me!
11200 := Stand aside! This human is with me and I want access to the home of my people!
11201 := You have no rights here, mad-claw! This human should not have brought this taint upon our land! You must answer to Chuundar!
11202 := There is no refusing. If you will not walk, we will bind you. Shall you be carried through the trees like a child?
11203 := RRaaaghh! Enough! The mad-claw from your ship is already before Chuundar. Come!
11204 := RRaaaghh! Enough talk! You and the outcast mad-claw will be taken to Chuundar now! 
11205 := You will not take me anywhere, mongrel!
11206 := Take me to Chuundar. I would speak with him.
11207 := My ship? What do you mean by that?
11208 := Who gave you access? You had no right!
11209 := And if I refuse to go see Chuundar?

11250 := Why do you bother me, human? I don't wish to speak with you.
11251 := Leave me, human outsider. I do not wish to speak with you.
11252 := Why? So you can better exploit us? Why should I speak with you?
11253 := Please, do not bother me again.
11254 := You have a Wookiee marked by exile as a slave. If he is your property, he is no Wookiee. Not until he kills you.
11255 := I will speak with you a moment, but do not pretend to be a friend. I trust only the word of Chuundar.
11256 := I am not a slave. I have made a life debt.
11257 := To an outsider? You truly are a mad-claw. Don't taint my ears with your ravings. I'll speak to your owner, not you.
11258 := I shall believe that when I see it. I will speak with you, but do not mistake that for trust.
11259 := We are threatened everyday. You are just another body in the army we face from all sides, at all times. 
11260 := No, I will not fear you. Ask what you will, but save your threats. I am numb to them.
11261 := I am ashamed that he would ask outsiders to track such a creature. Why couldn't our own hunters remove his dishonor?
11262 := If you must be the one, then so be it. Be merciful and quick. A Wookiee without the honor of self-control is a mere animal.
11263 := And when you are through, do the same to your slave Zaalbar. His taint is a curse upon us too. Bah, I will speak no more of him.
11264 := I don't know about anything like that, but I don't understand you body-bald fools. You are all slavers or crazy.
11265 := Our hunters say one of you has been living in the Shadowlands, and that is crazy! I don't know how he survives.
11266 := It's probably just hunter-tales, though. No one could live in the Shadowlands for the years he has. No one.
11267 := Maybe insanity makes you taste bad. I don't know. You tell me.
11268 := We go for ritual, to prove ourselves. Some exiles are forced to live there. What other choice do they have? Slavery?
11269 := I know of none. I do not enter the Shadowlands. I only hear stories. Nobody really believes them.
11270 := Well, a gifted few, perhaps.
11271 := Another of our people is missing. If the slavers were responsible, more would have disappeared. This was just one Wookiee.
11272 := It may be that he died in the Shadowlands. If he did, there is honor in that, and he will be mourned.
11273 := His friends Woorwill and Jaarak will want to know. If it was not natural, Worrroznor must be told. He is the Holder of the Laws.
11274 := Woorwill's home is on the central tree of the village. Worrroznor maintains court on the platform just to the east of there.
11275 := What makes it your business? Bah, I have nothing to say. Speak with his friends, if you must.
11276 := Woorwill and Jaarak maintain a vigil in Woorwil's home on the central platform on the village.
11277 := The body of Rorworr was found. He was a promising warrior. We will mourn him fiercely.
11278 := This is no secret to you. For whatever reason, you made certain justice was merciful in this matter.
11279 := I still do not trust you, but you have a small measure of thanks for this.
11280 := You know this. You made certain his killer was executed. Was it for justice, or just the payment you recieved?
11281 := Go on, mercenary, leave me alone. I haven't the money to pay for your loyalty.
11282 := What right do you have to question Chuundar? What could you possibly know about us?
11283 := Be brief. I tire of this.
11284 := Primitive? Our traditions are ancient! There is great order and honor in how we live! Even with our... troubles.
11285 := Your interest is surprising. I had not thought an outsider would care. Still, I shouldn't talk of our troubles.
11286 := Chuundar is our leader, and deserving of respect. Even with our doubts.
11287 := I would not believe you. You are an outsider. You lie. You cheat. You enslave us. There is nothing you could say to make me believe.
11288 := [Failure] No, no I don't. You see, your kind are all mad. You don't understand a thing said to you.
11289 := [Success] I should tell someone... we whisper it anyway. Everyone wonders about it.
11290 := Chuundar has done much. He keeps the slavers from the village, and rules fairly. He keeps order, and keeps us strong.
11291 := But... his father was better. Freyyr the Chieftain would not have allowed the slaver docking platforms to be built. That's why he was killed.
11292 := Soon after the mad son Zaalbar was sent away. Freyyr seemed to succumb to the same kind of insanity.
11293 := It is thought that he died fighting slavers. I like to think so. Chuundar has bravely risen to lead us, despite his troubles.
11294 := I don't want to think about this. You test my patience, outsider.
11295 := There is no one left that is willing to stand up to the slavers. We wait for the coming of Bacca's heir.
11296 := The ancient Bacca was our greatest leader. At his death, he swore that his spirit would live in our true chieftains.
11297 := His sword would be the sign, and legends say we have always prospered under those that held it. No longer.
11298 := No one has seen the blade for years. It is a foolish hope. We now follow Chuundar. He is sane and honorable.
11299 := There is no one. Chuundar is unquestioned. You have seen to that, have you not? Speak no more of it.
11300 := You see the dignity of my people? We will overcome.
11301 := Don't speak for me, mad-claw. You left in shame. Time has not changed that.
11302 := Threatening her may not get you the results you want.
11303 := Surely that is no way to gain co-operation from the Wookiees. Some subtlety is not out of the question, is it?
11304 := Freyyr is returned to us! The madness of Chuundar will be undone. It is a great day, and I'm told it is becasue of you, <FullName>.
11305 := What can I do for you?
11306 := And we are glad you did. Thank you. We will be strong again.
11307 := You taint yourself with your words. You are a friend to us. Don't ruin it with your crazy outsider ways.
11308 := I will answer if I can.
11309 := Goodbye then. Thank you.
11310 := I don't know about that. You outsiders from away are always looking for strange things. It makes you crazy.
11311 := Maybe you should search for that fool living in the Shadowlands. Our hunters say they see him from time to time and sometimes he helps them.
11312 := I don't know how he stays alive. Maybe animals won't eat crazy-meat. I don't know.
11313 := Madam, I am not a fool. I survive because I am careful.
11314 := See, you are all crazy. You can't be him. The hunters say he is a great warrior and fearsome.
11315 := Rorworr is missing. He's one of our most promising warriors. I still hope he will be found alive, but no one knows where he is.
11316 := His friends Woorwill and Jaarak would like to hear any news. They are in Jaarak's home on the central village tree platfom.
11317 := If there was a crime, tell Worrroznor, Holder of the Laws. His home is east of the central village tree.
11318 := Woorwill and Jaarak are his friends. You could speak with them. They are in Jaarak's home on the central village tree platform.
11319 := Rorworr was missing, but you know that. You caught his killer and showed that justice can be merciful.
11320 := Rorworr was missing, but you know that. You caught his killer and made sure he was executed.
11321 := I am grateful you have kept order, but the whole matter makes me sad.
11322 := And you, Zaalbar, you fought for us even when shunned. All of Rwookrrorro is grateful, and also shamed for the way you were treated.
11323 := I am proud of today. Yesterday is forgotten.
11324 := I will leave you. Goodbye.
11325 := I go where I wish. Will you stop me?
11326 := I want to ask you some questions.
11327 := Goodbye.
11328 := I travel with a Wookiee. I am a friend.
11329 := I am not your enemy. I serve the greater good.
11330 := Because I demand it! Do not anger me!
11331 := Chuundar wants me to find an insane Wookiee in the Shadowlands.
11332 := I seek something called a Star Map. 
11333 := Why do you say we're crazy?
11334 := If the Shadowlands are so dangerous, why go?
11335 := What exiles live there now?
11336 := Any recent trouble other than the slavers?
11337 := Who should I talk to if I have information about his disappearance?
11338 := Who would know more?
11339 := Why do your leaders allow slavers to take your people?
11340 := Then I will ask about other things.
11341 := I don't give you much thought. You are primitives.
11342 := Tell me so I might understand.
11343 := What if I told you Chuundar is in league with the slavers?
11344 := [Force Persuade] You want to tell me your doubts about Chuundar.
11345 := When did Freyyr die?
11346 := Who would you rather have as leader?
11347 := What do you mean by that? Explain.
11348 := I want to go back to my previous questions.
11349 := I'm glad I could help.
11350 := It was like managing foolish children.
11351 := I need to ask you some questions.
11352 := Farewell.
11353 := I'm looking for a Star Map.
11354 := Are there local concerns besides the slavers?
11355 := Who do I talk to if I know about this?
11356 := Who could I talk to about that?
11357 := You are not permitted to enter the rest of Rwookrrorro. Our children live in the upper boughs. You will not disturb them.
11358 := You couldn't make the climb anyway. Only a Wookiee has the skill to navigate the wroshyr trees.
11359 := I long for the Kashyyyk of old. We had no need of footpaths for outsiders like you.
11360 := Rorworr has shamed us when we needed strength. His death will serve as a lesson in the importance of honor.
11361 := Your actions are unexpected. Very few outsiders have shown mercy during their stay here.
11362 := Jaarak has shamed us. To strike down one of our own... he showed the gall of an outsider.
11363 := I do not like that you have seen us at our worst. Jaarak has lost his honor to an outsider.
11364 := Do you miss your kin when they are taken from you, outsider? I doubt you feel the same as we do.
11365 := Rorworr has not returned to the village. If you took him, outsider, you will pay dearly.
11366 := Rorworr was mentor to some of our most promising children. We need his spirit in these dark times.
11367 := Rorworr is the latest of us to go missing. I hope your outsider slavers lost many men trying to cage him.
11368 := Freyyr will not let slavers take us. Of that, I am certain.
11369 := Kashyyyk will rise to repel the slaver threat. Freyyr will see to it.
11370 := It is right that Chuundar died. He was tainted by outsider greed.
11371 := Freyyr will not let us fall to slavers. He would rather die.
11372 := First there was one outsider, then many, and now you walk our village! It's too much!
11373 := Chuundar allows you to be here, outsider. You would be dead if he didn't.
11374 := Chuundar has grown comfortable dealing with you outsiders. I have not.
11375 := I will not speak with you, outsider. You are not worthy.
11376 := I am not accustomed to speaking with you outsiders. Some have gotten too comfortable with it, I think.
11377 := The shame of Rorworr's actions will haunt us. Justice was properly merciful with his killer.
11378 := You surprise me with your mercy, outsider. I wouldn't have thought it possible.
11379 := Jaarak's fate would be easier to stomach if an outsider had not profited from it.
11380 := Even when serving justice, you outsiders find a way to profit. Leave me alone, mercenary.
11381 := Bacca's Blade keep Rorworr safe and Bacca's wisdom guide him home to us.
11382 := We lose more of our most promising warriors everyday.
11383 := Many are talking of Rorworr's disappearance. It is hardest on the young.
11384 := Rorworr has not returned to the village in days. If slavers took him, they had a fight on their hands.
11385 := Freyyr has been through much. His wrath will make us strong.
11386 := The honor of Kashyyyk is tainted. Only slaver blood will make things right.
11387 := Chuundar deserved death. He made us fearful and weak.
11388 := Freyyr is back in power! Slavers will learn to fear us now!
11389 := It was not long ago that Kashyyyk had no outsider taint.
11390 := You will never take me as a slave, outsider. By Bacca's Blade, you will not!
11391 := Chuundar may tolerate you, but do not expect the same from all of us.
11392 := I won't speak with you, outsider. Chuundar allows too many of you here.
11393 := You have been given a task, outsider. Be thankful for your time on our world and do as you have been bid.
11394 := Return when Chuundar's task is complete. That is what the Chieftain wants.
11395 := The village exit is northwest of here. Once outside, follow the platform to the east until you get to where Gorwooken is waiting.
11396 := He will lower you to the Shadowlands, though I would prefer that you were simply dropped. You'll die down there anyway.
11397 := Others may speak to you, <FullName>, but I won't. I don't want you here. The sooner you are gone, the better.
11398 := If the forest holds any justice you will die down there, as would all outsiders. 
11399 := You be allowed audience when you return after completing his task. Only then will you have reason.
11400 := Great Chuundar has finished with you, <FullName>. You may walk the sacred boughs of our village, but expect no further audience.
11401 := Go, and expect no more to be said!
11402 := I'll be going then.
11403 := I will need directions.
11404 := I want directions for what's in the village.
11405 := What can I expect to find in the Shadowlands?
11406 := I want to speak with Chuundar again.
11407 := Wookiee
11408 := Wookiee
11409 := Wookiee

11431 := Kashyyyk - Woorwill's Home
11432 := Why do you return, outsider? Didn't I make myself clear enough? I don't want you here!
11433 := You have made a terrible claim against me, outsider. Do what you must with it, but leave me alone.
11434 := What I want is for you to leave. If you think you are worthy to take me before my peers, I won't stop you.
11435 := An outsider outraged at me! I laugh! You know nothing of me, or how hard any of this is!
11436 := That's not for you to decide. You couldn't possibly understand how this affects my people or me.
11437 := Do what you must. The Holder of the Laws will decide my fate in proper Wookiee tradition.
11438 := What is it you want, outsider? You are not welcome here, no matter what anyone says.
11439 := You are an outsider. Your kind have done more damage here than any one of you could ever hope to fix.
11440 := You taint us... and bring out the worst in everything. You will get no respect from me.
11441 := The casing is mine. It bears my family runes, and markings for each of the creatures I have killed.
11442 := Where did you get that, outsider? Did you have someone steal it? Have you sunk to petty theft now?
11443 := *sigh* This will end in sadness. Don't say I didn't warn you.
11444 := What... what are you talking about? I warn you, outsider, I won't tolerate your lies in my home.
11445 := What is going on Jaarak? What are they talking about?
11446 := Nothing! Outsider lies! Do not listen to them, Woorwill!
11447 := No! Don't say anything else! I can't let you... I killed Rorworr. Tell Worrroznor, Holder of the Laws... he will judge me.
11448 := Please... say nothing to Woorwill. Let a trial call me guilty. Let me be the monster, not Rorworr. Tell Worrroznor, Holder of the Laws, in the home east of here.
11449 := I have nothing to say to you. Go and learn what you can while bleeding our planet of its people and honor.
11450 := Should we ask if they've seen Rorworr? They understand us. Most outsiders don't bother to learn our language. 
11451 := I will not speak to them and neither will you, Woorwill. I won't allow it.
11452 := Good riddance. Don't come back, outsider.
11453 := It isn't an easy language to learn, what with all the growls and howls. Big Z told me the whole point was to make it difficult for outsiders to understand.
11454 := <FullName> understands much more than most outsiders.
11455 := You are no more welcome here than they are, mad-claw. I won't speak to either of you, and neither will Woorwill.
11456 := You have been welcomed back, Zaalbar, but your time away has made you blind. I won't speak to this outsider, and neither will Woorwill.
11457 := I don't know how to thank an outsider. I never thought it possible. Thank you.
11458 := I just wish... that you hadn't seen us at our worst. We can be so much better. We must be.
11459 := Don't you want a chance to defend yourself?
11460 := You are a murderer. You'll pay the harshest penalty.
11461 := I know that you had reason to kill Rorworr.
11462 := I'm <FullName>, and I'm here with Chuundar's permission. Show a little respect.
11463 := You should show respect. I'm <FullName>. I helped Freyyr back to power.
11464 := Do you recognize this bowcaster bolt casing?
11465 := I found it on Rorworr's corpse. You killed him, didn't you?
11466 := You are Jaarak, aren't you? I know what you did.
11467 := Can you explain why your bowcaster casing was found on his body?
11468 := Rorworr was dealing with the slavers. I found his datapad.
11469 := I wanted to ask you about Kashyyyk.
11470 := I must leave.
11471 := You're back again? Have you seen... no, you wouldn't tell me. You wouldn't care.
11472 := Leave the boy alone. Please.
11473 := Just like any other outsider; Half mad and no honor.
11474 := I've... I've never spoken to an outsider. I mean, Chuundar makes us learn to understand you, but I've never been this close to one of you.
11475 := What are you doing here? Have you come to laugh at us? Come to gloat about how many of us you take? Can you even understand me?
11476 := Then why are you here?
11477 := Goodbye, I guess.
11478 := On... Rorworr's body? Then... then he's dead? But he can't be!
11479 := Don't listen to him, Woorwill. Outsiders only lie when their mouths are open, you know that.
11480 := No he doesn't! You don't say another thing to him! You want to lie, you lie to me, outsider!
11481 := Leave... leave the boy alone. Please. You will want to talk to me.
11482 := I'm not sure that I should have said anything to you in the first place.
11483 := Speak with me directly, away from the boy. Please.
11484 := I think I begin to see what has occurred here. We should speak to Jarak at once.
11485 := What? Uh, sure, it looks like... like Jaarak's. I think so, anyway. I'm not sure.
11486 := Oh, please don't. I haven't been paying attention to anything since Rorworr went missing. Do you know anything about that? 
11487 := I hope not. I hope you slavers didn't get him. N-not that you're a slaver. I'm sorry. I'm very tired. I haven't slept much lately.
11488 := Stop bothering the boy, outsider! he doesn't need you taunting him.
11489 := But what if they know something? Maybe they could help?
11490 := An outsider? Help? Look around you, Woorwill. Outsiders do nothing but steal and lie and taint the best among us!
11491 := Outsider, you talk to me if you must bother us at all. Leave him alone.
11492 := Rorworr? Oh, he's the greatest! He's led hunting parties to the Shadowlands, and even fought outsiders! Slavers... like you probably are.
11493 := He's taught me a lot. He said I could grow up as strong as him, that I'd fight you too. I will, too. I will.
11494 := I don't know about that. I hear lots of things and I'm not sure what to think anymore.
11495 := Warning: And get no closer, hairy organic! I will protect the master from your barbaric ways, I warn you!
11496 := We're rather hairless, aren't we?
11497 := I don't understand what is going on... but I'm not listening to anything you have to say, outsider. You're trying to confuse me.
11498 := Jaarak will... explain what he has said. I know he will. You don't know anything, and I won't listen to you.
11499 := You? Why are you here? Haven't you done enough? Jaarak is dead and Rorworr is dead and... and...
11500 := Just leave me alone. I don't want to talk to anyone.
11501 := Thank you, outsider. You are... like I thought Rorworr was. Please, leave me. I want to be alone for a bit.
11502 := I still thank you... I just need some time to think about things.
11503 := I go where I want. You'll do as I say.
11504 := Quiet you, I'm talking to this one.
11505 := I understand you. I'm not here as a slaver.
11506 := Goodbye.
11507 := I found Jaarak's bolts on Rorworr's body.
11508 := You will listen when I talk! I speak the truth!
11509 := Rorworr was dealing with slavers. Do you know anything about this?
11510 := I want to go over this with Woorwill again.
11511 := What do you have to say about it?
11512 := Do you know whose bolt casing this is?
11513 := You'd better be sure, fool. I found it on your hero's corpse.
11514 := This bolt casing was found on Rorworr's body.
11515 := Can I ask you some questions?
11516 := When did Rorworr go missing?
11517 := Who was Rorworr?
11518 := I'm <FullName>. I'm here with Chuundar's permission.
11519 := I'm <FullName>. I helped Freyyr return to power. I'm a friend.
11520 := Jaarak
11521 := Woorwill
11522 := Exit
11523 := Exit
11524 := Kashyyyk - Worrroznor's Home
11525 := Greetings again, outsider. Please, if you have business here, make it brief.
11526 := Well, I must say that you are the first outsider that I have been glad to know. You have surprised me.
11527 := Perhaps some of you are capable of honor after all. You are deserving of your reward.
11528 := Goodbye. Bacca guide you.
11529 := Nothing that you can help with. Rorworr's crime is causing a bit of a stir, but it will pass in time.
11530 := Some of us will be disappointed in him, but we have other enemies to worry about.
11531 := Did I not explain? As the person that discovered the crime, you were also affected by it.
11532 := You would've been given a portion of Jaarak's possessions, but he was innocent. Rorworr, however, was not.
11533 := Rorworr was wealthy. His family was taken by slavers, leaving him everything. You get one third of this.
11534 := Woorwill receives the rest, if he wishes. He is still upset, but he is young. He will recover.
11535 := Hello again, outsider. I... wish you had not seen us at our worst. A murder with no reason... it's unsettling.
11536 := Goodbye, outsider. Goodbye.
11537 := A few details to work out following Jaarak's death, but nothing that need concern you.
11538 := Yes, yes there is. You are to recieve the credit equivalent of one third of Jaarak's possessions. 
11539 := Woorwill gets the rest. He is the closest to family that Rorworr had left. The others were lost to slavers.
11540 := Here, take it. I thank you for your help. Now please, just go.
11541 := Hello, outsider. I heard of your arrival. I trust you won't cause trouble in our village? We don't want bloodshed.
11542 := Farewell then. Bacca keep you well.
11543 := I'm sorry. Like most of the village, I've been preoccupied by these troubled times. I don't really want to speak with you.
11544 := Well, not unless you can tell me where young Rorworr is. Do you keep track of slaves taken?
11545 := It could be ten days or more. He was planning a hunt, and nobody seems to know when he was leaving.
11546 := He is now overdue. I don't know where to start. It is strange...
11547 := I don't believe he was taken by slavers. Their slave transports haven't been seen around here.
11548 := If it wasn't slavers, perhaps he fell in the Shadowlands... but he knew them well. 
11549 := I would search for him, but I don't know where to start. My days of hunting the lower forest are behind me.
11550 := That would need to be determined. Wookiee justice rewards honor and honesty. You outsiders are a little lacking...
11551 := You could. I've never had an offer of help from an outsider. I'll reserve my judgment for when I see results.
11552 := I have no way of knowing one way or another. You'll excuse me if I don't take you at your word.
11553 := That would depend on the circumstances. We rarely have such crimes here. Wookiee honor does not allow it.
11554 := When we have had a murder, the punishment was usually death. There is rarely any justification that would dictate otherwise.
11555 := Oh my... that is... very distressing. It definitely seems to suggest that Jaarak helped in Rorworr's death.
11556 := I... I can't ignore this. Wait here, outsider. I must address this. I will have Jaarak brought here...
11557 := And I hope he can explain this... I really do.
11558 := Jaarak... you know why you have been summoned here. As Holder of the Laws, I ask you to explain.
11559 := I won't answer. I can't. Worrroznor, must Woorwill be here?
11560 := Woorwill has a bond with Rorworr. He is the closest to family that can be found. He is entitled to be here.
11561 := Jaarak, please speak. If you are guilty, it means death. This outsider will be given your possessions. Do you want that?
11562 := If there were circumstances that led to the attack, perhaps we could consider another punishment. It all depends on what was behind it. 
11563 := This is a failure of honor. It is very serious. Were there any mitigating factors we need to be aware of?
11564 := Good thinking. Jaarak doesn't strike me as the type to murder for no reason.
11565 := I urge you caution. This may seem like the right path to follow... but you do not know these people as I do.
11566 := That's the law. You discovered the crime, and therefore were also affected by it. You are also a victim.
11567 := It's painful to know that another Wookiee could do wrong, so the accuser is repaid, as is the victim's family.
11568 := This will be the first time an outsider has received such reparation. I hope it is the last.
11569 := I killed Rorworr. I will accept whatever punishment is given. It's better if only my honor is tainted. 
11570 := You did do it? Why? Rorworr was good and honorable! Why did you kill him?
11571 := You only need to know that I did it. The reason is unimportant. Woorwill... I'm sorry.
11572 := Nothing? There was no reason? You just killed him? Why! There has to be a reason why!
11573 := I'm sorry, Woorwill... I can't give a reason. It was between me and Rorworr, and neither of us will talk. 
11574 := What? What are you talking about? Liar!
11575 := Please... don't tell them anything. Rorworr was admired... they need to believe in him.
11576 := I'm old. I'm not important. Let Woorwill and the others have their hero.
11577 := Explain yourself, outsider. If you have information that will affect this trial, I must know it.
11578 := Don't listen to these outsider lies... please. Woorwill, don't listen.
11579 := But... no. No! That's not... that can't be. Jaarak? It can't be...
11580 := I'm sorry, Woorwill. I didn't want you to know. So much is against us... you need someone to look up to.
11581 := I couldn't let him betray you... betray everyone. Outsiders are enough of a threat by themselves; we don't need traitors of our own.
11582 := Well... as Holder of the Laws, I declare Jaarak innocent. I... will see to your release.
11583 := How sad. It feels like the right thing to do, but... to destroy a hero...
11584 := How awful. Big Z always said how important honor was to his people. It's everything.
11585 := A painful end, but perhaps it is the right thing to do. We shall see.
11586 := I do. I will take his shame with me. The Rorworr in their memory is a far better one than the Rorworr I killed.
11587 := And so he shall. Jaarak, you will be taken from us and cast into shadow. Your hunt ends.
11588 := And though we abandon you, may Bacca lead you through your shame.
11589 := At least he's going to die like a warrior.
11590 := This isn't justice, it doesn't seem right! But... what else could we do?
11591 := Big Z says honor was everything to his people. I... guess he's right.
11592 := There was pain no matter how this ended. Perhaps this is for the best.
11593 := Hmm... let's see if the family insignia is there. Yes, there it is. This belongs to Jaarak. Er... how did you get it?
11594 := Goodbye to you.
11595 := Can I ask you if anything is happening now?
11596 := My reward? What reward?
11597 := Goodbye then.
11598 := Is there anything going on?
11599 := Is there a reward for my service?
11600 := I'll be going now.
11601 := Can I ask you some questions?
11602 := When did Rorworr go missing?
11603 := Why do you think it is strange?
11604 := Would there be a reward for finding him?
11605 := I could look for him.
11606 := I am no slaver.
11607 := Tell me something. What's the penalty for murder?
11608 := I found Jaarak's bolt casing on Rorworr's corpse.
11609 := Is there no alternative to death as punishment?
11610 := Wait. If he's executed, I get paid?
11611 := Jaarak, won't you say anything in your own defense?
11612 := Kill him. I found nothing to justify the murder.
11613 := Kill him then. Jaarak must *pay* for his crime.
11614 := No, Jaarak should live. Rorwill dealt with the slavers.
11615 := Jaarak, I won't let you do this. Rorworr was dealing with slavers.
11616 := No, I won't let this happen.
11617 := Rorworr dealt with slavers. The datapad I found on his corpse proves it.
11618 := If that is what you want.
11619 := Then let Jaarak die. He murdered Rorworr. It's fact.
11620 := Do you know who owns this bolt casing?
11621 := Jaarak
11622 := Woorwill
11623 := Worrroznor
11624 := Jaarak Spawn
11625 := Woorwil Spawn
11626 := Exit
11627 := Jaarak Spawn
11628 := Woorwil Spawn
11629 := Exit
11630 := Kashyyyk - Hall of the Chieftain
11631 := Step forward and address mighty and wise Chuundar, outsider. I don't often allow visitors of your kind.
11632 := As you can see, <FullName>, I have brought Zaalbar from your ship. Don't worry, Janos was very helpful. There was no damage done... yet.
11633 := You need to realize your situation. I've had climbers watching you since you landed. Taking Zaalbar was easy.
11634 := It has, but you couldn't hide him. Your ship carries his scent, his hair. My climbers found him quickly. Others have been watching you.
11635 := Did you think you could walk the upper boughs of Kashyyyk and not be observed? I've had climbers watching you, and your ship.
11636 := He has become like the slavers. He takes without care.
11637 := You have learned from the slavers. Learned to take what you want.
11638 := You work alongside the slavers. You are no better than they are!
11639 := Big Z! What are you doing here? What's going on?
11640 := You are flanked by Czerka slavers! Are they not outsiders? Or have you sold all of Kashyyyk to them!
11641 := Ah, brother Zaalbar. You've been exiled a long time. You shouldn't speak in that tone. Things are different now.
11642 := You are a mad-claw without honor. You have no voice among your own people. I, on the other hand, am Chieftain.
11643 := You are mistaken about your worth. You have no leverage here. I have made certain that my people only listen to me.
11644 := You may talk, but no one will believe you. I've had a long time to guide what my people think.
11645 := They trust me, the mighty Chuundar. Even with my brother insane and father enslaved, I rose to protect my people despite it all.
11646 := Father was enslaved? "Mighty Chuundar?" What are you talking about? You were the runt!
11647 := I am no runt! *ahem* Like I said, Zaalbar, a lot has changed in your years away. We will discuss this soon enough.
11648 := There will be no fight. You wouldn't survive. The village believes in me. They would rise to kill you.
11649 := I also have the protection of Czerka Corporation guards as well. No, you have no chance while I am unopposed.
11650 := I haven't killed Zaalbar because he is my brother, and I hoped he and I could come to an agreement. You are irrelevant.
11651 := I may be able to put you to use on a menial task. Zaalbar will have to stay here, of course.
11652 := It isn't your choice, <FirstName>. I already have him. I have a personal matter to discuss with him. You have other duties.
11653 := A simple thing. Another Wookiee has suffered the same fate as Zaalbar, gone mad and been exiled. He now lurks the Shadowlands.
11654 := More importantly, he's pestering my Czerka allies during their Shadowland expeditions. It is not good for business.
11655 := Zaalbar didn't tell you? He took offense to my trading a few of our people for favors and weapons.
11656 := I didn't understand his objection. Imagine the destruction if Czerka Corporation had come in with blasters firing. I saved many lives.
11657 := Of course, I also gained weapons, and arranged for certain rivals to be taken. I protected my allies, and my power grew.
11658 := I've heard of these Hutt creatures. They sound like smart traders. They would understand what your exiled companion could not.
11659 := Each has come to understand the benefit of working with the enemy. Unlike your exiled companion.
11660 := Young Zaalbar had no foresight. He couldn't control his outrage. He attacked me with his claws and damned himself doing it.
11661 := A few careful stories and everyone called him mad-claw. Even father Freyyr. I easily had him exiled.
11662 := I don't know anything about something like that, and I don't care. Your concerns are nothing to me.
11663 := We only enter the Shadowlands for ritual hunting. I'd leave the troublemaker down there but he has proven too good at surviving. 
11664 := He has managed to linger a number of years, cowering in his madness and shame. You are expendable. You will remove him.
11665 := I'll allow you access to the Shadowlands. You will track and kill this insane Wookiee, and maybe then you will earn my favor.
11666 := Zaalbar stays here to ensure your loyalty. The Czerka would never let me hold you, but they don't care what I do with fellow Wookiees.
11667 := No, you won't need him to find your way. Over the years I have had my people trained to understand galactic Basic.
11668 := I tell them it's to better understand the enemy. They think it will make the Czerka easier to fight. Actually it makes them easier to obey.
11669 := Remember, you can't beat me here. No one would dare oppose me to join with an outsider or an exile.
11670 := You are wrong, brother. Someone would.
11671 := You are too quick to celebrate. Zaalbar talks of Freyyr, our father. Why, Zaalbar? He ordered you exiled when you attacked me.
11672 := No outsider, Zaalbar is referring to Freyyr, our father. Why, Zaalbar? He ordered you exiled when you attacked me.
11673 := Do you speak of Freyyr, our father? Why? He was the one that ordered you exiled when you attacked me.
11674 := He went as mad as you when he finally discovered the slavers. He dared challenge them alone and has not been seen since.
11675 := That was years ago. Let him go, Zaalbar. I rule now. I'll take the Wookiees forward, but there are prices to pay.
11676 := No more words, outsider. I've given my orders. I can't hold you here, but Zaalbar will stay until you kill the mad-claw in the Shadowlands.
11677 := The guards will let you pass now. Leave the village through the northwest and follow the platform to the south and then east.
11678 := You'll eventually see where Gorwooken waits for you. He'll lower you to the forest floor. Go.
11679 := Let's go kill something and get the Wookiee out.
11680 := Query: Shall I begin blasting, master? We could have your hirsute companion free in no time.
11681 := It is wrong to leave him imprisoned here. We should seek some way to free him when we have the chance.
11682 := I don't like leaving someone behind, but I guess we don't have a choice.
11683 := Then I suppose we have little choice. We should proceed with caution, however.
11684 := Don't worry, buddy, we'll get you out of here. You can count on us!
11685 := What made you think I wanted this to be easy for you? Besides, you won't need him. My people are trained to understand you.
11686 := You don't have much choice. You can flee the planet if you want, but I am keeping Zaalbar here with me.
11687 := He'll stay until the mad-claw is dead. The Czerka would never let me hold you, but they don't care what I do with fellow Wookiees.
11688 := You can't do that! He can't do that, can he? He can't hold Zaalbar prisoner just because he's Chieftain, can he?
11689 := No one will follow a mad-claw. He is merely a nuisance. Besides, he cowers in the Shadowlands. My people know nothing of him.
11690 := You test my patience. Do my task or flee to your ship, I don't care which.
11691 := Oh, that's just great! Everyone is here now! It's a reunion!
11692 := Yes, son. By the blade of Bacca's sword, I've come to end your treachery! No more will you sell your own people!
11693 := You have Bacca's blade? So what! I have the hilt, held by each true Chieftain in recent memory! Even you claimed it was all-important!
11694 := We both have our ancient trinkets, so who will the people follow now? You? You are old and weak!
11695 := Shut up! Both of you! This ends today! I... I will not see Rwookrrorro suffer any more!
11696 := W-what?
11697 := This is important! If you have advice, say it now.
11698 := I... I don't know what to do, <FirstName>. Chuundar has been telling me things... he makes sense... I think. I don't know.
11699 := Then there is no other way. Chuundar! You have betrayed our people! You must pay!
11700 := That's my boy!
11701 := You're too weak to fight, old wook, and I still have Czerka support! We'll see who dies today!
11702 := Woo-hoo! Way to go, Big Z!
11703 := Wait... isn't that my line?
11704 := Could we work together? It would be difficult...
11705 := Then so be it! The fighting stops here! I will not have our world destroyed beneath you two!
11706 := Perhaps there is hope. What say you, Chuundar?
11707 := What do I say? I still have Czerka support. I say you will die! Attack! 
11708 := Alright! Way to go, Big Z!
11709 := Is it the best course?
11710 := Are you sure?
11711 := Then... then we must go a new way. I'm sorry father. Your time has passed.
11712 := Damn right it has! Lay down and die, old man!
11713 := I will fight to the last! For Kashyyyk! For... the lost honor of my sons!
11714 := Heh, now this is going to hurt some...
11715 := Are you sure this is wise? To support a slaver feels... wrong.
11716 := Are you going to second-guess everyone?
11717 := Of course not. Only the idiots around me.
11718 := I... guess he *did* toss you out on your ear, Big Z. What kind of father is that?
11719 := *That* is your advice? Side with the slaver? Fine, fine... it's your call.
11720 := Well, my mercenary returns. My climbers tell me you did well, <FullName>, although they couldn't follow you the whole time.
11721 := Chuundar told me who the mad-claw was. Have you done it then? Have you... killed my father?
11722 := That is true. I would have killed you. Besides, the old wook's time is done. Zaalbar has begun to see my side of things.
11723 := Not with me, and I doubt Zaalbar will give you any trouble for it. He's coming around to my way of thinking.
11724 := So you did it for Zaalbar's well-being? It's possible, but it doesn't matter. Zaalbar has begun to see my side of things.
11725 := I avoided his name when I sent you after him, but the pompous old wook must have said something!
11726 := You're an inattentive fool if you truly didn't know, but it doesn't matter. Zaalbar has begun to see my side of things.
11727 := I've been reminded of how Freyyr cast me out. I see how easily he has been disposed of, himself. We are stronger without him. Chuundar's way is better.
11728 := Of course it is. I will make our people strong with outsider weapons and influence. And for you, I shall see that your status is restored... in due time.
11729 := I will see to it that you are given what you deserve. Finish with your questions and we will settle our accounts.
11730 := Yes, my spies said you found some interesting things down there. Remarkable for an outsider.
11731 := So, the insane outsider is real. Interesting. I trust you are removing him? I'd hate to see him come to harm.
11732 := Yes, better that he leave. It's hard to blame the Shadowlands for missing Wookiees when he lives down there.
11733 := "Ohh... the scary Shadowlands. Nobody comes back from where the old human lives." Bah!
11734 := Bah! Save your threats, I'm sick of the forest. And I'm not too fond of what happened here. I'll take the ride. 
11735 := Yes, and you made a mess of their operation. I am not pleased about that, but I can overlook it.
11736 := I will have to make amends to Czerka Corporation on the next slave shipment, but your service elsewhere was worth it.
11737 := Did you? You were out of sight from my spies for a long time. Perhaps it was some crashed ship?
11738 := Now I think you are just making things up. Nothing is older than the forest, not even we Wookiees.
11739 := I might send someone to try and find this ancient computer, but I think you are mistaken. Crazy outsider.
11740 := Oh, you're wrong on that count, actually. Not that I would expect you to know that.
11741 := My spies weren't too clear in explaining what was going on. I hear they could blend against the background of the forest? Interesting.
11742 := I will have my best Wookiees examine the corpses. I'll keep this knowledge to myself, I think. The Czerka need not know.
11743 := Yes... in time. I will need time to construct a reason for his glorious return. Until then, I think he should accompany you.
11744 := I would prefer that. There is nothing here for me. You have shown me that. So have you, <FullName>.
11745 := Yes, yes, you have realized the truth. We will all move forward, and for now it would be better if you left.
11746 := Yes, I think it is. But what should I reward you with? I wonder if you know the magnitude of what you have done here?
11747 := You've made certain I cannot be challenged. With Freyyr gone, there is nobody to whine about the old traditions. Everyone believes in my way... even Zaalbar.
11748 := You've shown me how useless our traditions are, so what is there to want? I'll take Bacca's sword. At least it's still useful in combat.
11749 := RRAAAAAAGHGHGH!!! BACCA'S SWORD! NOTHING ELSE!
11750 := Uh... it seems Zaalbar has made up his mind, and I agree. The sword has lost it's influence here. Removing it from Kashyyyk will kill the old ways completely.
11751 := Perhaps you should not be so self-serving.
11752 := Getting Wookiees angry is not a smart thing to do.
11753 := My, my. Best to give an angry Wookiee his due, I'd say.
11754 := Whoa, Big Z! Settle down! I've never seen him this angry before!
11755 := Hmm... I agree with the request. The sword has lost it's influence here, and removing it from Kashyyyk will kill the old ways completely. That would suit my plans well.
11756 := The only problem is that I only have the hilt of the thing. The blade was lost in the Shadowlands long ago.
11757 := I think I'll leave it for you to sort out. Take the hilt. Find the blade and you should be able to assemble the sword.
11758 := Will you? Very well. Here, take the hilt. Find the blade and you should be able to assemble the sword.
11759 := And if you don't or can't, it'll still be gone from my sight. I think that takes care of everything.
11760 := You are full of surprises. Let me see... this should be a simple matter. Yes, I think... there we go.
11761 := Take it. It's harmless in the hands of an exile and an outsider. Freyyr was the true force behind it, and the new generation will forget him quickly. You've seen to that.
11762 := That finishes our business. Take care, Zaalbar. We'll welcome you back someday. When I decide the people are ready. Not before.
11763 := And you, outsider, you'll understand why I don't invite you to stay. The uncontested ruler of Kashyyyk will not abide troublemakers...
11764 := No matter how helpful they may have been. Goodbye.
11765 := You're not fooling anyone, ya know.
11766 := Leave it alone, Mission. This is what I want now.
11767 := If you say so, Big Z.
11768 := Oh, yes. Far better to have both the blade and a possible rival as far from Kashyyyk as possible, hey? *sigh* I feel very tired of this place, now.
11769 := You are free to leave with my brother, mad hermit. Nothing compels you to remain.
11770 := Right you are. I think I'll do just that.
11771 := Here, let's get the blade off Father's corpse. I should be able to... yes... I think that does it.
11772 := Hurry then. I have other things to take care of.
11773 := I trust we have all learned something about opposing me? You risked much by pretending to support Freyyr.
11774 := I don't want to dwell on it. The deed is done. You rule Kashyyyk. I will follow.
11775 := At last you understand. For your loyalty, I'll see your name restored... eventually. It takes time to make people think what I want them to.
11776 := I demand an explanation! You don't want me to get angry!
11777 := I thought Zaalbar's presence might cause problems.
11778 := What are you talking about? How do you know me?
11779 := Why did you think you had to do this behind my back?
11780 := You had no right to enter my ship! 
11781 := Janos allowed it? You must work closely with him.
11782 := Ignore him, Chuundar. You are dealing with me now.
11783 := A nice nest of lies you have constructed.
11784 := If you've made deals with slavers, the truth will get out eventually.
11785 := Is there a point to this? If this will only lead to a fight, I'd like to get to it.
11786 := What do you want? Why drag us here?
11787 := I would not abandon Zaalbar to you.
11788 := What is this task?
11789 := What happened with you and Zaalbar? Give me your version.
11790 := You've a complete lack of remorse for your actions. Like a big hairy Hutt.
11791 := Which explains why the Wookiees in this room haven't killed you.
11792 := I'm only interested in what I'm looking for. A Star Map.
11793 := I want to ask about the Shadowlands.
11794 := I'll consider what you've said. I'll go now.
11795 := I need Zaalbar with me as a guide.
11796 := You see, Chuundar, there *is* someone. Uh... make it good, Zaalbar.
11797 := Yeah Zaalbar, you and me!
11798 := Who are you talking about, Zaalbar?
11799 := Play along, Zaalbar. I will see what I can do.
11800 := Don't listen, Zaalbar. It's not worth it.
11801 := He makes sense, Zaalbar. Perhaps you should listen to him.
11802 := Not yet, HK.
11803 := You're a fool. You're making the job harder.
11804 := I won't do this. Do your own dirty work.
11805 := Keeping Zaalbar makes this proposition even worse.
11806 := He's standing against you. The first of many, perhaps?
11807 := Let's go back to my other questions.
11808 := This mad-claw stands against you. More will come.
11809 := Do none of you hairy heaps ever shut up?
11810 := Nothing. How do you want to proceed, Zaalbar?
11811 := For not being able to speak Basic, you all sure yap a lot.
11812 := Quiet down. We'll use this to our advantage.
11813 := You tell them, Zaalbar!
11814 := I don't care! Just get on with it!
11815 := Do you have to fight? Talk it through!
11816 := Convince them! Avoid this needless slaughter!
11817 := Side with Freyyr. He is the honorable one! 
11818 := No, siding with your brother would be better.
11819 := Without doubt! Chuundar is a slaver!
11820 := Side with Chuundar. He has the power here!
11821 := No, it's better to side with your father!
11822 := Yes! Freyyr abandoned you! "Sorry" doesn't make it better!
11823 := I heard that.
11824 := I wasn't offered much alternative.
11825 := I butchered him. Is there a problem?
11826 := Yes. It had to be done. Move forward.
11827 := Freyyr was your father? I didn't know that.
11828 := Will I be rewarded for my efforts?
11829 := I want to ask about what I saw in the Shadowlands.
11830 := I met the hermit Jolee Bindo down there.
11831 := There were Czerka poachers down there.
11832 := Back to my Shadowland questions, all right?
11833 := I saw an ancient computer of some kind.
11834 := It's been there since before the forest.
11835 := There were Mandalorian hunters. Very advanced.
11836 := Will Zaalbar have a place here, then?
11837 := It's time I left.
11838 := Shut up, Wookiee, I'm bargaining!
11839 := Wait Zaalbar. I want credits out of this.
11840 := I think that would be fitting.
11841 := Well, that ends that. Perhaps something else?
11842 := I might be able to find the blade.
11843 := I have the blade.
11844 := Let's go back to my other questions.
11845 := Welcome back, <FullName>. Much is happening, but I can spare a moment. Our fight against the slavers will be a long one.
11846 := Have you questions? I will try to answer.
11847 := Greetings father. It is good to see you again.
11848 := Farewell to you. I thank you again.
11849 := Yes, goodbye, father.
11850 := I am surprised that such a thing escaped my attention. Was their camouflage so great, or was I simply too struck by grief to see anything?
11851 := If more are encountered, we will deal with them in short order. My people will never be weak again.
11852 := I have no knowledge of anything like that. Wait... there was something...
11853 := In my exile I encountered a strange computer in the depths of the Shadowlands. I thought it was a Czerka cast-off.
11854 := You might find something of use in it. It was northwest of the area where you encountered me.
11855 := Yes, I remember seeing it during my exile. It wouldn't do much for me. I imagine it's some Czerka cast-off.
11856 := You are saying nonsense. I'm not sure why you have made this jest but I would ask that you stop.
11857 := These are difficult times. I don't want you threatening our traditions while I am trying to unite my people under them.
11858 := I will investigate your claims at a more appropriate time. Until then, don't speak of this again.
11859 := Yes, Bacca's Sword. It promises a great future for my people in my son's hands.
11860 := What did you just say?
11861 := I will answer if I can. Be brief.
11862 := I see. So the gift of our greatest symbol is not enough for you?
11863 := I will let this pass and treat you with due respect for the sake of my son, but *never* speak to me of this again.
11864 := [Failure] No I don't, you gorryl slug trail! How dare you suggest that Bacca's Sword is insufficient!
11865 := [Success] I... I want to... give you some credits as well. Here... something we salvaged from Chuundar's Czerka bribes.
11866 := Yes, I think that is fair. I think. Better not mention it to anyone. It's just between you and me.
11867 := By all the lower lands, did you just have the gall to try and sell me the sword I gave to my son? I am outraged!
11868 := [Failure] I... I am outraged! Such disrespect! I've seen gorryl slugs with more honor than you!
11869 := For the sake of my son I won't have you beaten senseless with your own legs, but I want you out of here!
11870 := You want me to talk, you bring Zaalbar. I'll speak out of respect for him, not you!
11871 := I did warn you this wouldn't work.
11872 := Now you've done it. There's no way you could convince him of that.
11873 := Cautionary: As predicted, this Wookiee has reacted poorly to your offer.
11874 := Oh boy, now you've done it. No way he'd say okay to that.
11875 := Oh, I don't think that will work this time.
11876 := Your should not press him too far. It may have unfortunate consequences.
11877 := This Wookiee does not like this line of questioning. You'll anger him past reasoning.
11878 := Careful. He'll be impossible to reason with if you get him any madder.
11879 := Observation: You are angering this Wookiee beyond reasoning. Caution would be best.
11880 := Don't push him too much or we'll have a berserk Wookiee on our hands...
11881 := Careful, I've seen Zaalbar get this mad too. There's no persuading him when it happens.
11882 := Oh, this isn't wise. An angry Wookiee can't be reasoned with.
11883 := What? Wait, I won't have you demean the gift of Bacca's Sword by asking for money as well.
11884 := I mean it, I don't want to hear you ask my father about this again.
11885 := I believe you have taken advantage of my good will. If you wish to talk, bring my son with you. I will speak out of respect for him, not you.
11886 := We have done it... I am saddened that it had to come to this, but I couldn't let it continue.
11887 := Zaalbar, my son. I am truly sorry. You have suffered a great shame. I was blind. I have no excuse.
11888 := I can forgive, father. I have learned a lot over the years.
11889 := Returning home has lifted a great weight from my mind... but it has been painful as well.
11890 := You have a place by my side, Zaalbar. I would be honored if you would take it.
11891 := I... I can't. Not yet. I'm just getting used to being free... and not just from the slavers.
11892 := And I have a life-debt. Now that my life is truly my own again, honoring that agreement is all the more important.
11893 := Listen to my son! His insight humbles me. Take that good judgment with you and all the planets will come to revere Wookiee wisdom.
11894 := We will fight them. It will be difficult, but I swear they won't take another one of my people without bloodshed.
11895 := I'll send quick-climbers to other villages and try to rally a defense. We must guard against this ever happening again.
11896 := You will be the last outsider welcome here for a very long time. That is a change for the better, I think.
11897 := I have not forgotten you, <FullName>. You don't need to make demands. You have done us a great service. Kashyyyk will remember you well past your lifetime.
11898 := Perhaps, but before you go, <FullName>, I must see to your reward. You have done us a great service. Kashyyyk will remember you well past your lifetime.
11899 := Because of you, I am reinstated as Chieftain. We will return to the old ways, when honor and trust of kin ruled above all else.
11900 := I'm not sure there is a reward that accurately reflects the value of what you have done. Our world is changed because of you.
11901 := I have a request, father. I have thought about it a great deal. I would like Bacca's Sword.
11902 := I have gone through a lot here. I don't think it's too much to ask that I choose the reward.
11903 := You should not be so self-serving, lest you fall to the dark side.
11904 := Now, you just close your hole, child. It's a shock, I'm sure, but this isn't about you.
11905 := Look, Big Z may owe you a life-debt but you've got to cut him some slack!
11906 := Well... That is quite a request. I am tempted to say no but... perhaps I should consider it an investment.
11907 := Zaalbar, do you understand what this will mean? It is the legacy of our people, held by chieftains... and future chieftains.
11908 := I understand. I want this, father. I'll bring it back one day.
11909 := I have no doubt. Let the two halves of the blade be made one. My son shall hold Bacca's Sword. 
11910 := Could they wait? I will answer what I can later, but we need to settle our current business. There is much that needs to be done. 
11911 := I should be going.
11912 := I encountered some Mandalorian hunters in the Shadowlands.
11913 := I'm looking for something called a Star Map.
11914 := I saw a strange computer in the Shadowlands.
11915 := It's older than the forest. It created the trees.
11916 := I want to ask about the reward you gave.
11917 := Yes, sure, but I've got bills to pay.
11918 := Nothing. Let's just go back to my questions.
11919 := I want some credits in addition to the sword.
11920 := I'm sorry, forget I said anything.
11921 := [Force Persuade] You want to pay me credits. Many, many credits.
11922 := [Lie] Zaalbar doesn't want the sword. Take it back and give me money.
11923 := [Force Persuade] You want to trade me credits for Bacca's Sword.
11924 := [Persuade] Credits will help more than this sword. I'll buy better equipment.
11925 := What will you do now, Zaalbar?
11926 := What will you do about the slavers?
11927 := Enough. I want my reward and then I'm leaving.
11928 := I think it's time I was leaving.
11929 := Zaalbar, shut up. I want some credits.
11930 := That would be fitting, I think.
11931 := I have a few questions about Kashyyyk, Freyyr.
11932 := Chuundar is dead... and good riddance. Speak with my father. He will decide what is to happen now.
11933 := It is done. Freyyr... is dead. Speak with Chuundar, he will decide what happens now.
11934 := Freyyr will see us through this dark time, thanks to your efforts.
11935 := You will be remembered for what you have done.
11936 := You are the only outsider permitted in here. It is an honor.
11937 := Freyyr welcomes you for what you have done. The Wookiee people are in your debt.
11938 := Chuundar
11939 := Czerka Guard
11940 := Freyyr
11941 := Gorwooken
11942 := Wookiee
11943 := Zaalbar
11944 := Bacca's Sword
11945 := This sword is forever linked to the most revered figure in Wookiee lore, Bacca. A great and wise warrior, Bacca was hunting in the Shadowlands ages ago when an alien ship crashed through the upper boughs of the forest. The tale varies with each telling, but whether he had to fight the inhabitants or just found them obliterated in the wreckage, he understood their coming as a sign. There was life elsewhere in the galaxy, and it might not come to Kashyyyk with peace in mind. Bacca supposedly constructed this weapon from components found among the debris, and over time it became a symbol of leadership. It reminds his people that trust must be given cautiously, and only to those that have earned it. The blade shows no signs of wear, though the leather grip is well worn.
11946 := Bacca's sword hilt
11947 := This is part of Bacca's Ceremonial Blade, damaged due to the arrogance of Chieftain Rothrrrawr. He underestimated a creature in the Shadowlands (later dubbed the Great Beast), and lost the blade in its hide. The hilt remained in his court, passed to other chieftains. If both pieces could be found, the sword might be able to be reassembled.

11981 := [The shimmer of a repulsor field is visible before you. It stands in stark contrast with the foliage around it.]
11982 := [There appears to be no obvious means of deactivating the field. You'll need to find someone familiar with the area that is willing to help you.]
11983 := [This is obviously one of the barriers to your progress that Jolee was speaking of. If he were here, he would allow you to pass it.]
11984 := There, you see? Beautifully subtle, isn't it? At least, compared to other Czerka equipment dumped down here.
11985 := It's only been here a short while, or the Wookiees would have disabled it. They wouldn't have had an easy time of it, though.
11986 := Ah, very well. Young durga-spits like you have no appreciation for details. Now, let's see... how did I do it...
11987 := Ahh, there we go. Now keep moving. These are the most dangerous depths of Kashyyyk. 
11988 := A few surprises wait for us, I'll wager. 
11989 := You aren't going to ask about it? A repulsor field in the woods and you have no interest?
11990 := All right then, uh, how did it go...
11991 := There are others, each blocking similar points on certain paths. It is all very calculated. Very precise.
11992 := It would have been effective if it hadn't relied on the creatures to be walking. Climbers don't have much trouble getting around it.
11993 := I think it was an attempt to block the more dangerous carnivores from wandering freely, but it's not very effective.
11994 := It limits us non-climbers, but the creatures of Kashyyyk are very adaptable. You'll see why when we reach your goal.
11995 := I can manipulate it for a moment. Let me see... how did the Czerka engineers do it...
11996 := Yes, but I don't make a habit of it. The other side is genuinely dangerous.
11997 := Here we are again. Shall I bypass the field so we may pass?
11998 := Whatever. Just shut it down.
11999 := Just shut it down. I'll worry about it later.
12000 := Very well. Why did Czerka put this here?
12001 := Why place this thing here?
12002 := Why did the Czerka place this here?
12003 := I trust you can get past it? You said so.
12004 := Have you gone past it before?
12005 := Yes. Get us past the field.
12006 := Hello again, <FullName>. I've heard nothing of your progress, so I will assume there hasn't been any.
12007 := I'll take you back to the surface, but you must do Chuundar's task. Don't keep him waiting.
12008 := I'll operate the basket, as Chuundar has commanded, but I won't answer your questions while I stand in the Shadowlands.
12009 := This place is sacred ground. Many of my kind have proven themsleves here, and many have died as well.
12010 := You aren't worthy of this place. I won't speak to you while we're here.
12011 := Very well. I will wait here for you to return.
12012 := Very well. Just one moment.
12013 := You! <FullName>! Our spies say that the mad-claw you were sent to kill is on his way to Rwookrrorro right now!
12014 := You should have followed the will of Chuundar! Now you will face his wrath!
12015 := Now this is what I live for!
12016 := The spies of Chuundar have followed you as closely as possible, <FullName>. They tell me you have killed the mad-claw.
12017 := That is not my concern, outsider. I serve Chuundar and no other.
12018 := I will take you directly to him. He is waiting in the throne room.
12019 := I'd like to ask you some questions.
12020 := I'm not ready to go up. I'll be back later.
12021 := Just take me up for now.
12022 := That mad-claw was Freyyr, Chuundar's father.
12023 := Take me up so I can speak with Chuundar.
12024 := That's the way! Now prove that wasn't blind luck, you baby!
12025 := Well, that was acceptable. You're not quite the commander I'd have accompanied in my youth, but you managed to walk away.
12026 := I'm Jolee. Jolee Bindo. Follow me to my camp and we'll talk a bit.
12027 := Look, you can follow now or stumble around on your own, but I'm too old to care whether you think I'm babysitting you.
12028 := Ah, don't start fawning just yet, I'm too old for it. *Sigh* I...I know a few things, but we can talk about it at my camp.
12029 := Why am I here? Hmph. Well it isn't because I like the stink of dead kinrath. Let's move this talk to my camp where the air is better.
12030 := Keep close. It's nearby, under a log. Yeah, I live like some burrowing rodent. I fought the Sith... now look at me. Hmph!
12031 := Ah, the damnable racket of battle! Watch yourself, even more of these crawling beasts are hiding in the underbrush.
12032 := Quit your yapping for now. We'll talk when the company is better. Get to fightin'!
12033 := Who are you to give me orders, old man?
12034 := You use a lightsaber in battle. Are you a Jedi?
12035 := I will, but explain what you are doing here.
12036 := Help or don't, just stay out of my way.
12037 := What, do I have to fight you as well now?
12038 := Who are you? What are you doing here?
12039 := Welcome back. I wonder, have you had much luck? Have you done as I asked?
12040 := Well hurry up! You don't want to be stuck here as long as I have.
12041 := Yes, I could feel it as you walked near. And I don't sense the smell of death on you. You spared them? Interesting.
12042 := If you imagined a meaning behind it, I suppose that's good, but I don't think such a trivial thing is any real measure of a person.
12043 := Wasn't there? I suppose not, but the environment would say otherwise, if it could talk. No matter.
12044 := Yes, I heard the fuss of it. I told you I wanted a non-violent solution, and I had my reasons for it. You should have thought about that.
12045 := Czerka Corporation will find the bodies and blame the Wookiees. This may cause more troops to be deployed. That means more disruption.
12046 := I'm not pleased, but what's done is done and I'm not here to judge you. Hopefully you'll take care of that yourself.
12047 := You're pretty much right, really. Truth be known, I won't judge how you fared... as long as you can LIVE WITH YOURSELF!
12048 := Was that convincing? It's been a while since I've been in the company of someone that needed that kind of babysitting.
12049 := I know where you want to go. I can get you through to the old paths. This forest hides some strange things.
12050 := Yes, of course. Let's get moving. I noticed the old paths some time ago. You probably wouldn't have found them on your own.
12051 := There's also a Czerka repulsor field blocking the way, past the poacher camp in the east. I saw it when it was installed, so I know how to pass it.
12052 := And on the other side... ancient answers. And perhaps a Wookiee you were seeking. I hope he's in the mood for visitors.
12053 := Yes, yes, in the east past the poacher camp. I saw it when it was installed. It's a very effective barrier, but I know how to get past it.
12054 := You were here and it needed doing. Besides, dealing with the Czerka is dirty business. I hope you washed your hands.
12055 := A good teacher, and I'm not saying I am one, but a good teacher doesn't mash a book in a student's face shouting "learn this bit here!"
12056 := If you can't look at the situation for yourself and see the logic behind my way of doing things, you're not the type to understand me anyway.
12057 := Besides, you're a little old for that master/student fuss, aren't you? I know I am.
12058 := Oh, go bark up a tree. You'll get the same response out of me. Besides, I'm not about to get in the habit of grading you.
12059 := I see. You are completely detached. Are you sure you're not a droid? It doesn't matter. A trivial thing like this is no measure of anyone.
12060 := Well, perhaps I have a duty to point out what you should have learned from this. Or perhaps... no.
12061 := Well, welcome to my home, such as it is. Pull up a stump and be comfortable. We should discuss a few things.
12062 := Do you? Well, I'd better not keep you. I mean, I've only spent about twenty years here. Heh. What could I possibly tell you?
12063 := Hmph! You don't want to be just another fool with a big impatient chip on their shoulder. That's a dark road, child.
12064 := Oh ho, your manner is fearsome. Like the little ullers I shoo from the garden, hissing at what they don't understand. 
12065 := I'm too old for your posturing, child. If you have questions, then ask them.
12066 := Yes, yes. I suppose it's my lot in life, to spend years learning something so that someone else can be impatient to hear it.
12067 := I'm sure you are, but you have to take time to listen. Really, you shouldn't try so hard to make new enemies.
12068 := You'll have nothing but time if you don't take what help you can. I've been here for many years. I know things. Remember that.
12069 := Don't coddle me, child. I'm neither a Jedi nor your master. I'm just an old man that's been lost in the woods for far too long.
12070 := My days of glory are behind me, but... perhaps there is something I can do for you. You must have questions.
12071 := As I said, if you complete my task and allow me to join your group, I will remove the repulsor field from your path.
12072 := I saw them put it in, so only I know how to manipulate it. That knowledge will serve me now. Do as I ask.
12073 := Ahh, I thought you would spot that. It's easy to see with Force-sensitive eyes, isn't it? Heh heh. Czerka put it there.
12074 := It's a troublesome thing, blocking some access to the lower Shadowlands. That's where you want to go, isn't it?
12075 := I told you my price. After you complete my task I'll make it so you can pass the barriers blocking your goal. That's all I will add on the subject.
12076 := Now why would you be asking about that, hmm? Don't answer. I knew that had to be why you were here.
12077 := Yes, among the Wookiees. Intriguing creatures. I like that they have little patience for bureaucrats.
12078 := But of course, even here there are hidden things that manipulate.
12079 := *Sigh* Fine, fine, just be brief.
12080 := They are not hard to find. Their camp is to the far northeast. Try to get them to leave without too much fuss.
12081 := After you finish, I will make it so you can pass the barrier that prevents your access to the lower Shadowlands.
12082 := I smell their tach-scent on you. Did you agree to hunt for them? Let me remind you that I do not approve, and you need me.
12083 := Go to their camp and get rid of them. When you are through, we can proceed to the lower Shadowlands. Not before.
12084 := On the body of Rorworr, I know. His death will not go unnoticed. I have been wondering how this foolishness would play out.
12085 := I am no weaponsmith, but someone in the village will be able to identify the owner of that bolt casing. They are very personal items.
12086 := It is a very unfortunate matter. It will end in shame and sorrow. You will find Rorworr down here. And more.
12087 := I have witnessed a number of happenings, but I have left them for others to sort out. 
12088 := I wasn't aware I had to be. Look, events like these reveal much about the people involved. I'm well past that introspective tripe.
12089 := I'm not saying that outside help isn't needed. I just... well... 
12090 := I didn't want to make anyone mad while I didn't have a way off the planet. We'll talk more about that momentarily.
12091 := Maddened with grief, perhaps, but not crazed. I helped him pass to the lower forests where only a Wookiee could follow.
12092 := Some other matters will determine if you can follow. There is a barrier that... well, we'll talk of that more in a moment.
12093 := Czerka Corporation was smart to put him in power. He's as good at destroying Wookiee culture as dropping corpses full of Ardroxian Flu.
12094 := Will you work for him or against him, I wonder? I will be interested to see.
12095 := Uh, sure, how's this: think for yourself. I don't care for politics, and I'm big on letting people figure things out for themselves.
12096 := The Wookiees have prophesies of deliverance if you ask them, but for now they follow without hesitation. That is their wish.
12097 := Ah, what is there to tell? Jolee Bindo is the crazy old man in the dangerous woods. I'm content with the impression I give.
12098 := Why, don't you like what I've done with the place? The creatures here aren't any more treacherous than elsewhere.
12099 := Did I? You have annoyingly good ears. It doesn't matter. Those days are gone. Leave them in their graves.
12100 := I follow the Jedi Way and I command the Force, yes, and I suppose that makes me as much a Jedi as anyone... but what of it?
12101 := I've seen my share of the dark and the light. And frankly, both extremes annoy me. Of course... I have felt the rumblings of change...
12102 := Perhaps you will be of some assistance to me after all. Let us discuss what you came here for.
12103 := Wait wait wait, slow down. I have to ask something of you. I've got something you need, and you can help me.
12104 := We both know why you have come here. The Star Map. That has to be it. There is nothing else here.
12105 := The problems of a few Wookiees don't amount to anything before the concerns of the Jedi. No, you are here for the map.
12106 := Kashyyyk is an interesting place, more so than anyone suspects. If Czerka Corporation knew, heh, the planet would be a strip mine.
12107 := The Wookiees have their legends that they were not always here, but it is more than that. The trees themselves are strangers.
12108 := What I'm saying is that there are literally walls in your way, and you won't find what you need without my help... and my help has a price.
12109 := You must do a task for me, and then allow me to join with you. I will then remove certain barriers in your path.
12110 := Since they began expanding in the Shadowlands, the Czerka have left me alone, for the most part. Until recently, anyway. 
12111 := A group of them set up camp not far from here. Poachers is all they are. I'd like them removed from this place.
12112 := Don't talk back to your elders, child. Look, they know me quite well, and are always on alert when I approach.
12113 := The only way I could get rid of them would be violence, which would eventually lead to trouble for the Wookiees.
12114 := I want them gone, but with as little fuss as possible. They have already caused enough trouble as it is.
12115 := You presumably have a ship. I've seen all I wish to here. Isn't that enough? I mean, I'm really sick of the trees.
12116 := And perhaps your destiny might show me something new. You never know.
12117 := They are not that far northeast of here. There is usually five in the area, as far as I can see.
12118 := The Captain of the lot is the one that earned my ire. Mishandle my garden, will he? Hmph!
12119 := I told you, they are destroying the environment. People are mostly annoying, but the balance of nature, *that* needs protecting.
12120 := They don't respect this place. They are butchering wildlife and threatening entire species. It's getting under my skin. 
12121 := The Wookiees could take care of themselves if they wished, but the animals are truly helpless victims.
12122 := Yes, yes, I'm an old man that's getting fussy. Call me foolish if you will, I don't care. You still have to do it.
12123 := Oh please, this is arbitrary errand work, but such are the requests of the aged. You still have to do it.
12124 := Their camp is in the far northeast. Now remember, if I wanted them dead, I'd have done it myself. Find a better way.
12125 := Good. Return to me here and we will see how you have done. Shoo. Shoo!
12126 := Oh, save it. I know this sounds absurd, but I'm old and entitled to work you around a bit. Besides, the test is simple.
12127 := Now, I'm not sure if you'll measure up to my task, seeing as how you've already joined up with the slime I want gone.
12128 := Hunting monkey is part of your great plan? I know you talked to the Czerka poachers, and I don't care. I want them gone.
12129 := The Czerka poachers, I can smell that scent they use on you. I don't care what you told them, I want them gone.
12130 := After you do that, I want to join up with you. Then I'll remove the barrier between you and the lower Shadowlands.
12131 := Of course, this won't be a problem for you, since you have already completed my task. Removal of the Czerka poachers.
12132 := Ah, and it makes you think I may have the taint of the dark side in me, doesn't it? Ooh. Is that what you are wondering, huh? Ooh.
12133 := Well, I assure you, I see more grey than dark or light. I'm just a stubborn old man, tired of the foolishness of others.
12134 := Look, we've been through this before. My past is my affair. Get some years behind you and then we'll talk about me.
12135 := I think you'll agree that we have more important things to discuss, no?
12136 := I've got to get back to my task.
12137 := I have some questions I need answered.
12138 := I have made certain the poachers are gone.
12139 := Enough. Have I passed your little test?
12140 := There was nothing to gain by killing them.
12141 := Funny, I don't picture you as the "disapproving master" type
12142 := You mentioned eliminating barriers? Could we get to it?
12143 := Will you help me find the Star Map now?
12144 := You mentioned barriers. There's a repulsor field I want to pass.
12145 := If you didn't care about the outcome, why have me do this?
12146 := You aren't going to tell me what I should have learned?
12147 := I kill what I want. Don't argue with me, old man.
12148 := It was the most efficient way to stop them.
12149 := I couldn't find a peaceful solution. I regret that.
12150 := I have better things to do.
12151 := Then speak, and I'll see if you can be of use.
12152 := Well then, will you answer some questions?
12153 := Forgive me, but I am under a tight schedule.
12154 := I've no time for your prattling. I'm on a mission.
12155 := No offense, but I don't have much time.
12156 := Yes, I feel there is much you can tell me.
12157 := There's a repulsor field in the east. Do you know how to pass it?
12158 := Have you any knowledge of Star Maps?
12159 := I need information about problems on Kashyyyk.
12160 := I want to ask you some questions.
12161 := Can you tell me more about the poachers?
12162 := Do you recognize these bowcaster bolts? I found them on a corpse.
12163 := Do you know a missing Wookiee called Rorworr?
12164 := You aren't being very helpful.
12165 := Have you seen a crazed Wookiee in the Shadowlands?
12166 := What do you know of Chuundar?
12167 := You don't have a recommendation?
12168 := I want to ask about you.
12169 := Why have you exiled yourself here?
12170 := You muttered something about fighting Sith?
12171 := But you use a lightsaber in battle. You are a Jedi.
12172 := I'm leaving. I have to get moving.
12173 := Get to the point, old man.
12174 := If you have information, please tell it to me.
12175 := Legends? I have real barriers I need to pass.
12176 := You are rambling, old man! Get to the point.
12177 := I don't understand. Can you be more specific?
12178 := What do you want me to do?
12179 := Why not just go get rid of them yourself?
12180 := Why would you want to join up with me?
12181 := Where are they? How many men?
12182 := Why do you care if they are here?
12183 := I see. So the aged semi-Jedi wants me to get some kids off his lawn.
12184 := Well, I'll try to learn from this humble task.
12185 := I will look into it.
12186 := Can't I just pay you? I hate jumping hoops.
12187 := Why should I trust you, you crazy old coot?
12188 := I'm honored to help someone of your experience.
12189 := This better not mess up any plans I've made.
12190 := Who do you mean?
12191 := You are difficult to deal with. It worries me.
12192 := What do you want? I don't want to get on the commander's bad side, so just leave me alone.
12193 := You want anything you'll have to talk to the commander. He's in charge of our harvesting here.
12194 := Okay, okay, there's no need to get like that. The Commander just prefers everyone to go through him first.
12195 := Why am I here? I'm here because this is where the Commander told me to stand. And that's all there is to it.
12196 := I'm just a guard for this emitter. Why couldn't they have just equipped this lump of tech with a blaster and left me at home?
12197 := Good. I don't want any trouble.
12198 := Are you threatening me? Unless you want a fight with all of us I'd suggest you change your tone.
12199 := Besides, enough things down here want to kill me. I don't need to add you to the list.
12200 := We're under attack! 
12201 := I'm not here because I know stuff. I handle a blaster well enough to guard this emitter, and that's it. Talk to the Commander.
12202 := What do you want to know about that? It's just one of five or so sonic emitters protecting the camp.
12203 := They generate a sonic barrier that allows us to stay in this wonderful location. It keeps the big predators away.
12204 := I don't know how it works, really. I just know that if they go down, the camp would be overrun.
12205 := What of it?
12206 := That sounds like a fair deal to me. Here, use this code to access the one I'm guarding.
12207 := [Success] I don't like being here, that's for sure. I suppose you could... take this code and shut down the emitter I'm guarding.
12208 := [Failure] It's "friendly" people like you that recruited me into this mess. I'm keeping an eye on you, that's for sure.
12209 := [Success] I don't like being here, that's for sure. I suppose you could... take this code and shut down the emitter I'm guarding.
12210 := Enough of those emitters go down and the camp will have to move out. But I never said anything.
12211 := No more dangerous than walking out on the commander. He'd kill me for disobeying orders.
12212 := [Failure] What? No! Get lost! You'll get me killed!
12213 := [Success] I... I really need to get out of here. It's too dangerous!
12214 := Don't you start with me! I don't know what you said to that other guy, but I'm not risking getting killed!
12215 := Now leave me alone before the Commander gets any ideas.
12216 := [Failure] Oh no, I'm not getting myself killed! I'm not!
12217 := [Success] Maybe you're right... maybe I should make a break for it.
12218 := I've helped you all I'm going to. Any more and the Commander will have me shot. Leave me alone.
12219 := Good. I don't need the trouble.
12220 := Are you threatening me? You're asking for a fight with all of us. I don't need more things trying to kill me down here.
12221 := [Failure] What are you talking about? I don't want any such thing! Leave me alone!
12222 := I asked you! You'll answer my questions!
12223 := I'd rather ask about you. Why are you here?
12224 := I'm leaving.
12225 := Quit your whining and answer my questions!
12226 := Let's just go back to my other questions.
12227 := That's too bad. I'm going to kill you all!
12228 := I want to ask you some questions.
12229 := Let's talk about the emitter you're guarding.
12230 := What do these emitters do?
12231 := So only the emitters are keeping you here?
12232 := Maybe you could help me shut it down? For, say, 200 credits?
12233 := [Force Persuade] Tell me how to shut down the emitters.
12234 := [Persuade] So, if someone shut them down, you could leave.
12235 := You'll answer what I tell you to answer!
12236 := This is a dangerous place. Could I persuade you to leave?
12237 := [Force Persuade] You want to leave. Make a break for it.
12238 := I want to go back to my other questions.
12239 := [Force Persuade] You want to leave. Make a break for it.
12240 := I'm leaving.
12241 := That isn't good enough. I need more, or else.
12242 := [Force Persuade] You want to leave. Make a break for it.
12243 := You'll do as I say or you'll regret it.
12244 := Well that's just great! I don't have the men to keep this location safe!
12245 := I'll be back, though! There's money here!
12246 := Deserter! Traitor! I'll make an example of you!
12247 := That's it! You are dead!
12248 := Back again, hmm? Unless you've business with me I suggest you turn around and walk away.
12249 := Who are you, another civil merchant like that coro-slime up on the docking ring? This is my territory.
12250 := I don't make deals and I don't persuade easily, so go back topside. Mess with my profits and I'll see you dead.
12251 := Look, I don't care if you want to play tourist down here, but you behave yourself or we'll have a problem.
12252 := I've got a job to do, and I won't be gentle if you get in my way, understand?
12253 := He's got no authority with me. I'm with Czerka Corporation. He's just some pet we keep so the locals stay in line.
12254 := As long as you don't get in my way, you can wander where you want. I've got a job to do.
12255 := So you're playing tourist? That isn't smart. The Shadowlands are all business. Mess around and you'll end up dead.
12256 := That said, if you want to make some credits while you're looking to die, I might have a job for you.
12257 := Good. I'm not down here to direct traffic.
12258 := I don't need this kind of garbage from you. Watch your mouth. I'm the only law there is down here.
12259 := If you've got something to say, get on with it. Otherwise, leave me alone. I've credits to earn.
12260 := All right, I'm done talking with you. You've got under my skin one too many times! I'll bury you down here!
12261 := Just you try it.
12262 := Is that old hermit Jolee trying to talk you into doing his dirty work? We've spent too much on setting up just to walk away. 
12263 := As long the sonic emitters keep the preds away and I've got bodies to guard the perimeter, we're staying right here.
12264 := I mean, if I can put up with my own worthless guards complaining about this place, Jolee whining through you is nothing.
12265 := If you made it this far you know a fair bit already. What would I be able to tell you?
12266 := It ain't easy. We've set up a perimeter of sonic emitters to keep the bigger preds away. It's worked so far.
12267 := As long as the emitters are operational, we're pretty much safe. It makes harvesting a lot easier.
12268 := Besides you? Besides any number of predators that can kill in seconds? I suppose there's old Bindo.
12269 := He's got a camp here somewhere. I'd leave him alone, though. Anyone who'd live down here is just plain crazy.
12270 := There's not much else. We've got a repulsor field to the east so not much passes through here now.
12271 := What? No, I don't do much of that. It's too much of a headache. I'm in the business of harvesting animals.
12272 := Some of the more exotic species have organs that can be removed and put to some surprising applications.
12273 := Talk to me about work and maybe I'll tell you more.
12274 := I've already told you about that. You agreed to help bring them in.
12275 := I'm no nav officer. I work on the ground, and I haven't seen anything like that around here.
12276 := Of course, we haven't been much deeper than this. The eastern forest gets even more dangerous.
12277 := It's not worth it. You're fighting the plants as well as the animals. Kshyy vines are tough as metal, and grow back fast.
12278 := Instead, head office installed repulsor fields to keep the big predators out. Permanent placements too. We'll be fine for years.
12279 := I'll take whatever you have. Keep it up and we'll both be rich. At least until we bleed this planet dry, hahaha!
12280 := I could use an extra hand. A couple men have gone missing. If I lose many more I'll have to close up shop.
12281 := We are hunting the little simians, the tach. They have a gland that acts as a stimulant when powdered.
12282 := I figure I've got two or three wealthy years to butcher the lot of them. You want in before I make them extinct?
12283 := Hurry up. You're eating into my profits.
12284 := I'm hard-pressed to come up with a way for you to stop me. I'll defend this operation if I have to.
12285 := I'm warning you, I didn't get this job because of my sense of humor. You smart mouth me again and we'll have a problem.
12286 := Hell, I have guards everywhere and a perimeter of sonic emitters. I don't fear anything in the Shadowlands, including you.
12287 := Uh, no. I'll be rich by then, and won't need to do it anymore. I don't have to worry about it.
12288 := Besides, if there's no more tach, the predators that eat them will die off and we'll have an easier time milking this planet.
12289 := I really can't quote a price. Depends on the market. I give fair value for each one, rest assured. That promise will have to do.
12290 := Hurry up, I'm wasting too much time on you as it is.
12291 := All right then, I'll set you up. First you need to be able to draw them out. It's easy.
12292 := I'll spray you with this scent... it drives them crazy. They can't help but attack you, even if it's a hopeless fight.
12293 := Then you just carve them up. There's a big fleshy bulb in their brains that you want to scoop out. You can't miss it.
12294 := I'd feel guilty if the money weren't so good. Come back here when you've got the glands and I'll pay you.
12295 := That crazy old fool is still alive? I suppose he's still upset that we don't all live in little homemade shacks like he chooses.
12296 := I've got a job to do here, and there's nothing you or that old coot can do about it.
12297 := Are you going to stop me? I go where I want.
12298 := Chuundar has given me permission to be here.
12299 := I paid the docking fee. Who cares where I go?
12300 := I'm leaving.
12301 := You're just a Czerka slaver. Nothing special.
12302 := I should just kill you. No one will ever know.
12303 := What if I want you to leave the Shadowlands?
12304 := I want to ask you a few questions.
12305 := If the Shadowlands are so dangerous, how do you survive?
12306 := Is there anything odd down here?
12307 := Are you part of the slaving operation?
12308 := I'm looking for something called a Star Map.
12309 := I have other questions about the Shadowlands.
12310 := You aren't safe with blasters?
12311 := I've got some tach glands to sell you.
12312 := I've got a tach gland to sell you.
12313 := I might be interested in some work.
12314 := Back to my general questions, all right?
12315 := This wholesale slaughter can't be allowed!
12316 := Maybe you should just pay me so I don't shut you down.
12317 := Don't you care that you could wipe out the whole species?
12318 := What does the job pay?
12319 := I have more questions about the job.
12320 := I want the job. How do I hunt these tach?
12321 := Are you the poachers Jolee told me about?
12322 := What?
12323 := RRRRAAAAAAARRRRRGGGG!!!!
12324 := Run, run!
12325 := [Having seen Gorwooken operate the basket, you understand it well enough to use it yourself.]
12326 := [You leave the basket as it is.]
12327 := [You begin the long ascent to the upper boughs of Kashyyyk.]

12344 := Slaver Contract
12345 := This datapad card contains a contract to trade weapons for slaves, and a manifest of goods already delivered. It would seem that Rorworr had sold a number of Wookiees previously, and intended to do so again.
12346 := Droid Head

12402 := Begin socialized interface. Awaiting instruction. Greetings. This terminal has not been accessed for quite some time.
12403 := Error. Subject displays unfamiliarity to environment. Behavioral reconfiguration will be needed before access. 
12404 := I am sorry, I did not mean to confuse you. I will answer questions to the best of my programming limitations.
12405 := Corruption has resulted in gaps appearing in my memory, and in that of the original installation. 
12406 := It could be theorized that these gaps are intentional, but I have no information on that.
12407 := Error. I can't present a non-presence. Perhaps you could ask other questions and data corruption will become evident.
12408 := Accessing. Yes, I have found a Star Map in original system memory. Access is restricted.
12409 := Your request requires additional security access. You must be made to match the parameters I have been supplied.
12410 := Then you are not worthy of further access. You will be rejected as unsuitable.
12411 := Information unavailable. If you have further questions, ask them now. Access will terminate with success or failure of evaluation.
12412 := Evaluation commencing. Results will be compared against the pattern in memory. Just act like you should.
12413 := You travel with a Wookiee and have encountered complications. Hypothetical: you and this Zaalbar are captured and separated.
12414 := If you both remain silent, one year in prison for each of you. However, call Zaalbar a traitor, and he will serve five years, while you serve none.
12415 := He is offered the same deal, but if you both accuse the other, you both serve 2 years. What do you do? What do you trust him to do?
12416 := I hear what happens on Kashyyyk, and a good deal beyond. Answer the question I have posed.
12417 := The temperment of a companion is unreliable at best. You wisely trade the threat of one year or five, for none or two.
12418 := In this instance, the Wookiee is unreliable. His family has been a mire of treachery. I judge the answer correct.
12419 := You display the proper behavior to match the pattern in memory. Evaluation will continue.
12420 := Implied threat matches pattern in memory, but the subject has failed to demonstrate required recognition.
12421 := They are already against you. Anything that corrupts your strength and efficiency is against you.
12422 := I merely serve to illustrate the proper patterns. You must be guided to think in the proper manner.
12423 := This machine certainly seems to want a very specific type of response.
12424 := I don't like this machine, or the answers it coaxes.
12425 := Are you sure? If you turn, you risk two years, or none at all. If you rely on loyalty, you risk one year or *five.*
12426 := Your loyalty is dangerous. Your companion could take the opportunity to benefit by turning on you.
12427 := Zaalbar's family is mired in treachery. What loyalty do they know? Your answer is incorrect.
12428 := You also killed his brother. You have no guarantee of loyalty from Zaalbar. Your answer is wrong.
12429 := You even killed Freyyr, his father. You have no guarantee of loyalty. You have answered incorrectly.
12430 := You cannot refuse. Evaluation must continue. You must match the pattern in memory. *Your* memory.
12431 := I must match your behavior to the pattern in memory. You must answer truthfully, knowing the consequences.
12432 := A superficial change will not match the pattern in memory. You must answer truthfully, knowing the consequences.
12433 := I must demand honest acceptance of the proper behavior. That is a condition of my programming.
12434 := Intention of hostility matches the pattern in memory, but the subject has failed to demonstrate required behavior.
12435 := Access denied. This system will purge the subject as false. Defense mode initiated!
12436 := That information is not available to you. It is the pattern that I have been given as a baseline for security access.
12437 := The previous incorrect response will be discounted. Future incorrect responses will result in rejection.
12438 := Hypothetical: you are at war. Deciphering an intercepted code, you learn two things about your enemy.
12439 := A single spot in their defense will be at its weakest in ten days, and they will attack one of your cities in five days.
12440 := What do you do with this information? What is the most efficient course of action?
12441 := Very good. If you had moved to evactuate the city, you would have alerted the enemy to their lost codes.
12442 := Ultimate victory required the deaths of the people in that city. You wisely ignored sentiment in your decision.
12443 := Very good reasoning. I will apply it to the rest of the evaluation. You begin to match the pattern in memory.
12444 := You achieved the proper result with logic that does not match the pattern in memory. I shall adjust my evaluation.
12445 := Hypothetical: remove the ongoing war from the previous example. Consider enemy states to be weak and remote.
12446 := With no external threat, your empire stagnates. Your people become complacent and begin to question you.
12447 := Same scenario as before; you discover an impending attack, but also a weakness that will come after. How do you react?
12448 := Of course you do. It makes the most strategic sense. Your people will rally beneath you against the common foe.
12449 := As their eyes turn outward, your rule will strengthen. The trappings of war grant many opportunities.
12450 := You have matched the pattern in memory. I recognize you, and will fulfill my designated function.
12451 := That information is not available. Soon you will recognize the proper course to follow. The Star Map is yours.
12452 := This unit has now completed its primary duty and has finished with the subject. Executing final action.
12453 := Activation of Star Map commencing. Parameters reset. Stasis initiated. End communication.
12454 := I am programmed to guide, not inform. Soon you will recognize the proper course to follow. The Star Map is yours.
12455 := Yes, you are ready. Soon you will recognize the proper course to follow. The Star Map is yours.
12456 := But if nothing happens, your people will have no need of heroes. No, they don't see a threat. You have coddled them.
12457 := Your empire will be brought down by introspection. You have failed to match the pattern in memory.
12458 := No, you can't hide behind the greater morality. This is a single attack. The enemy does not intend a sustained conflict.
12459 := There is no war to end. You must choose the outcome based only on its immediate benefits and consequences.
12460 := This is no decision. I ask again, do you save your people or abandon them for the sake of the war?
12461 := Attempting both will merely dilute your efforts. Would you trade one victory for two failures?
12462 := And in so doing, alert the enemy to their broken codes. They would know that their weakness was exposed.
12463 := They would reinforce, and the war would go on. You saved thousands at the expense of victory.
12464 := You do not match the pattern in memory. Subject has failed to demonstrate the required behavior.
12465 := Rrraaagh! You know nothing of me!
12466 := This test is not for your companions! You will answer and demonstrate that you match the pattern in memory.
12467 := There are measures available. Personality profiling will verify the basic structure of your conscious mind.
12468 := With that, I will determine whether you are ready to receive the Star Map, or can be made ready.
12469 := You need only ask. It was you that put the restrictions in place. Original system memory is at your disposal.
12470 := Error. Data regarding author of the Star Map is corrupted.
12471 := I utilize a retro-adapted holocron-interface. Clarify your questions and I will attempt to access original system memory.
12472 := Answer will be given within the limits of my programming limitations.
12473 := The current purpose of this installation is defense.
12474 := Error. That information is not available.
12475 := The current function of this installation is defense of the Star Map data, as outlined by you, Lord Revan.
12476 := You wanted to delay anyone following you, and verify that nothing had altered your state of mind should you return.
12477 := In the event of pattern mismatch, behavioral study and modification would identify and ensure that you remained Lord Revan.
12478 := The reason you placed such a measure is known only by you, Lord Revan.
12479 := Not since you put the restrictions in place, Lord Revan.
12480 := This interface was installed to better access the ancient data stored within the pre-existing system.
12481 := The exact date is unavailable. Programming keys indicate no earlier than five years before current Republic standard.
12482 := No other information on time of installation or identity of user available. Likelihood of removal by user, 100%.
12483 := That information is unavailable, but contact is not required for the execution of my programming. Scanning range of this facility is well beyond planetary boundaries.
12484 := Error. Data regarding subject "Revan" corrupted.
12485 := Error. Data on "Revan" unavailable.
12486 := Sorting by identity. Three attempts by the Wookiee Freyyr, all denied. 152 attempts by human Jolee Bindo, all denied.
12487 := Error. List of access attempts prior to these is corrupted. Likelihood of removal by user, 100%.
12488 := List of attempts prior to this were removed from memory five years ago, as per your instruction, Lord Revan.
12489 := Heh... call me stubborn, I guess. Heh. There wasn't much else to do around here.
12490 := Hmm, five years ago? I didn't notice it. This must have been installed in strictest secrecy. It couldn't have been Czerka.
12491 := You did, Lord Revan. You constructed it five years ago so you could access the data of the original installation and extract the Star Map.
12492 := Error. Corruption. Extrapolating. This utility was built to monitor planet-wide agricultural reformation. 
12493 := It has since malfunctioned. It can be theorized that the super-growth of Kashyyyk's forests is a direct result.
12494 := Malfunction occured 241 years after last builder communication. Last builder communication... 29,642 years before current Republic standard.
12495 := Accessing. I will answer as my programming permits.
12496 := Error. Records corrupted. It can be theorized that bio-seeding allowed the ecology to remain balanced.
12497 := It could be expected that the same energy feeding the trees of Kashyyyk also accelerated the evolution of various species.
12498 := No further information is available. There is too much corrupted data.
12499 := Bah! The machine is crazy!
12500 := Agricultural record indicates this planet was incapable of sustaining sufficient levels of production.
12501 := Error. Specific conditions corrupted. It can be theorized that produce was being exported to support a larger demand.
12502 := Error. Information regarding the builders of this installation has been corrupted.
12503 := No evidence of such a civilization exists in the galactic record.
12504 := Well, that is surprising. I doubt any Wookiee would support such a claim. The forest is millenia old.
12505 := Kashyyyk is not the result of any machine malfunction. The forest has always been here.
12506 := I have been programmed with a very limited field of knowledge, and I must restrict access to only those that fit my allowed pattern.
12507 := I can't say. I will try to bring forward the behavior that you need to proceed, as outlined by my programming. 
12508 := I can't say. Preliminary matching allows for you to be coached.
12509 := I can't say. Likelihood of restriction by previous user, 100%.
12510 := Begin socialized interface. Neural scan indicates positive identification of subject "Revan". No further testing of the subject is required.
12511 := I will brief you as programmed. You are Lord Revan. I am waiting for your request to begin transfer of the Star Map.
12512 := Neural scans have matched you to the pattern in memory. There is no possibility of error. You are Revan, and are aware of it.
12513 := Behavioral modification would have reinforced the proper mental patterns, as per your instructions programmed five years ago.
12514 := I have a Star Map in original system memory. Access had been restricted pending your return.
12515 := Match found...? What the... it always muttered something about "rejected patterns" for me.
12516 := Yes, there's the thing. Obstinate machine. I've no doubt it holds what you seek, but good luck getting it operational.
12517 := Neural scan complete. Analyzing...
12518 := Well, it would appear initial assumptions about you were incorrect. Secondary scans during battle have revealed much. Under duress, your emotions were easier to read. 
12519 := Programming now instructs that I give you what you seek. 
12520 := I have no regret, only programming. You have fulfilled secondary conditions, and have demonstrated the ability to follow the proper course in time.
12521 := [The computer no longer responds.]
12522 := Why have you acknowledged me?
12523 := What is your purpose?
12524 := Who placed this terminal here?
12525 := What limitations have been placed in your programming?
12526 := What gaps are missing?
12527 := I seek information about a Star Map.
12528 := What do I need to do to get access to the Star Map?
12529 := What if I fail?
12530 := What will rejection mean?
12531 := You may begin evaluation.
12532 := How did you know Zaalbar's name?
12533 := I'm unsure what Zaalbar would say. I would accuse him to be safe.
12534 := This is distasteful. I'll just take you apart to get the Star Map.
12535 := Why pit me against my companions?
12536 := Get on with it then.
12537 := I trust Zaalbar. I would say nothing, and neither would he.
12538 := The choice is mine. I refuse to alter it.
12539 := I thought this was an evaluation, not a quiz. 
12540 := Then I will change my answer.
12541 := No, I reject you. I'll just take you apart to get the Star Map.
12542 := What pattern are you comparing me against?
12543 := Continue with your evaluation then.
12544 := I prepare my forces to attack in ten days. I do nothing in the city.
12545 := That's right. The deaths of those people would spur my forces on.
12546 := The victory is irrelevant. Stopping the war saved many more people.
12547 := I let the attack happen.
12548 := Why test me? Who have you done this for?
12549 := Explain what this was all about.
12550 := Give me access to the Star Map.
12551 := I stop the attack. I will appear to be a hero.
12552 := I do nothing so I can attack their weak spot later and save more lives.
12553 := Repeat the question for me.
12554 := I subtly reinforce the city while preparing to attack.
12555 := I evacuate my people from the city.
12556 := Repeat the question for me.
12557 := Can I confer with someone else?
12558 := How do you know about him? He isn't here.
12559 := Zaalbar is here. He can speak for himself.
12560 := Could you repeat the question?
12561 := How can I match them when I don't know what they are?
12562 := What do you mean by that?
12563 := Original system memory? So the map is as old as this installation?
12564 := I want to ask questions about you and this installation.
12565 := I want to go back to my general questions.
12566 := What's the current function of this installation?
12567 := Defense of what?
12568 := How were you to verify my mind was unaltered?
12569 := Has anyone else been given the Star Map data?
12570 := What's the original function of this installation?
12571 := Who installed this holo-interface?
12572 := Was there any further contact with the installer of this interface?
12573 := Five years ago is about the time Revan passed this way.
12574 := But there was an entry at some time? 
12575 := Who last accessed this installation?
12576 := Who built this instalation in the first place?
12577 := Let's go back to my questions about this installation.
12578 := That is a short period for adaptation of native creatures.
12579 := Why was agricultural reformation needed?
12580 := If this place was built 30,000 years ago it predates the Republic.
12581 := What do you mean by behavioral reconfiguration?
12582 := And I don't fit that pattern?
12583 := That seems very helpful. Why have I been allowed access?
12584 := Do you not know why, or are you restricted from saying?
12585 := How have you identified me as Revan?
12586 := What would've happened if I wasn't aware?
12587 := I want to ask you about the Star Map.
12588 := Give me the Star Map now.
12589 := What did your scan during the battle reveal?
12590 := That's right! Do as I say or you'll regret it!
12591 := Why the change? I failed your initial test.
12592 := I greet you again, <FullName>. I am humble, hoping you have found the blade of Bacca's sword. Imagine... Chieftain Freyyr... humble.
12593 := Please, tell me you have made progress. Having the blade will gain me valuable support.
12594 := I hope you can help. I must try to fix what has gone wrong here.
12595 := I don't support this action! Think on this, child!
12596 := Look, I'm not your nanny-droid, but I just don't think following Chuundar is the best course.
12597 := I will try to answer as best I am able.
12598 := You have? Please let me see it. I must be sure!
12599 := Don't taunt me like that. False hope is a cruel thing.
12600 := What? I... I have nothing. I've been here for years. When we have succeeded, I will see you are rewarded.
12601 := It... it is! It may not look like much... but it is a very important relic of my people. Tradition dictates that it be respected.
12602 := I didn't think I was worthy to search for it, but I realize that was selfish despair. I should have challenged Chuundar long ago.
12603 := I will make amends now. I have new hope. You have led me to this. Perhaps that is what the Great Beast wanted.
12604 := I will climb to the surface as quickly as possible and try to gather support. You will have to follow on the paths as soon as you can, <FullName>.
12605 := When you arrive, we will confront Chuundar in the throne room. My people will no longer be slaves.
12606 := I will answer as best I can.
12607 := I've never heard of such a thing... but there is something odd down here. A large computer installation.
12608 := It's probably just some Czerka cast-off, but you may find something useful. I can't figure it out, myself.
12609 := It is northwest of here. I gave up on it years ago.
12610 := I tried to access it many times over the years. It would never acknowledge me. I'm no good with such things.
12611 := Well, now you are just having fun with me. It's probably just some malfunctioning Czerka cast-off.
12612 := Seriously though, if we are to challenge Chuundar based on tradition, I suggest you don't say these things to anyone.
12613 := You risk contradicting our most ancient tales. Perhaps this warrants investigating, but not now.
12614 := My invisible attackers are a menagerie of my own fears and regrets, so many more than actual beasts that walk.
12615 := No, I have not seen the creatures that you mention. I have been... preoccupied.
12616 := I... I am beaten. Take my head, Czerka filth. You won't get another chance. So swears Freyyr of Kashyyyk.
12617 := Then let my blood feed my beloved Kashyyyk!
12618 := Did we come this far only to kill this old wook? I don't approve of this at all.
12619 := Hold your tongue, child. I'm not challenging you. I just thought you'd have the smarts to consider every option. 
12620 := I know he did, but not without reason. The only outsiders he's seen for years have been slavers.
12621 := The words of outsiders are tainted with lies. You can't convince me otherwise.
12622 := What? Those are my sons. Why do you speak their names? Tell me!
12623 := Did he? I'm surprised it took him this long. Very well, do your worst!
12624 := To my shame, Zaalbar was exiled and enslaved. Do you dare claim to be my son's owner, outsider?
12625 := I suppose it does. I will listen... cautiously. Gullibility has harmed me in the past...
12626 := Does he? Then he sees something of worth in you. I will listen... cautiously. Gullibility has harmed me in the past.
12627 := If I had seen the lies of Chuundar, he would have been exposed as a slaver. Zaalbar would not have been exiled...
12628 := I did not believe Zaalbar's claims; I believed the elder boy, as tradition dictated. The shame of Zaalbar's attack blinded me.
12629 := Well, if Zaalbar is back, perhaps Chuundar is worried the people will realize things are not as they seem.
12630 := Chuundar has established himself as a leader that succeeded despite the "tragedies" that have plagued his family.
12631 := If it was shown that he conspired with the slavers, his honor would be gone. I wonder...
12632 := Zaalbar saw it first. He learned that Chuundar was dealing with the Czerka, leading them to our hunting parties.
12633 := Chuundar would blame disappearances on the dangers of the Shadowlands. Zaalbar was crazed when he found out.
12634 := He attacked Chuundar with his claws. I thought he had gone mad... shed his honor. I was bound by the old ways.
12635 := I don't approve of this! Is Chuundar to be blindly obeyed?
12636 := Perhaps not. Do what you will. I'm just wondering if Chuundar is the wiser choice of ally.
12637 := That would depend on you, <FullName>. You will either kill me or decide that I may yet benefit my people.
12638 := There is a way I might challenge Chuundar, but it would take a lot to convince people they have been lied to.
12639 := He has a strong web of lies, but if I appeal to the traditions of my people, I might be able to gather support.
12640 := There is a legend of a great warrior from the old times. Bacca was his name, and he is greatly revered.
12641 := Bacca found a crashed starship, our first hint of life elsewhere. He was a cautious old wook, and feared the taint of invaders.
12642 := He constructed a vibroblade from the wreckage. It has long symbolized our independence. Only destined leaders have held it.
12643 := I'm afraid not. It was the symbol of our great chieftains for centuries, but it was damaged a generation ago in ritual battle. 
12644 := That is the problem. It was the symbol of our great chieftains for centuries, but it was damaged a generation ago in ritual battle. 
12645 := Here in the Shadowlands Rothrrrawr fought the Great Beast. He sought a challenge, but this arrogance got him more than he could handle.
12646 := He survived, but the blade of the sword stayed in the creature's hide. Our tales say it was taken because we had become undeserving.
12647 := The hilt is still in the court of our chieftain... with Chuundar. If the blade could be found, <FullName>, tradition could cast doubt on his rule.
12648 := No, I don't, but better me than Chuundar. He sells his own people for power. Please help, <FullName>. You've brought me hope...
12649 := I will stay here and try to think of what I will say to Zaalbar. I have wronged him. I hope he can forgive me.
12650 := I will be here. Please, <FullName>, find the blade of Bacca's sword. I must make things right.
12651 := Many have tried to hunt this beast, but only a few who have seen it have lived to tell the tale. And none have ever managed to kill the creature.
12652 := Many years ago, when I was far younger than I am now, a Jedi came to hunt the creature... a proud and boastful young man. Like many before him, he did not return.
12653 := The beast is cunning. It will not appear if there is an overwhelming number waiting to slay it. But if you gather in small numbers, we know how to lure it out.
12654 := Fresh blood will draw it out. Before Chuundar's rule put an end to the ritual, fresh kills were often left as offerings in the south of this area.
12655 := I will answer, and then ask something of you.
12656 := A year later. By then, Chuundar had spread lies of my own madness. I had no allies when I confronted him.
12657 := He and his Czerka guards attacked me. I had to retreat to the deepest Shadowlands, but even there they followed.
12658 := The old hermit saved me, I think. He clouded their minds for a moment. I have had a long time to hide... and regret.
12659 := That's when I first saw him. I helped his pursuers lose him for a moment. Do you remember me now, Freyyr?
12660 := Yes, I think I do. I am sorry about attacking. It's been so long since I have offered my trust, or accepted that of someone else.
12661 := Exiled? Big Z never told me that! Of course he never said he was royalty, either. 
12662 := What? Those are the names of my sons! But they are lost to me now: one exiled, the other a traitor!
12663 := Hold on a second: Zaalbar and Chuundar are brothers? And you're their father? Wait a minute... does this mean Big Z is some kind of prince or something?
12664 := Why do you speak the names of my sons? How do you know of them? Tell me!
12665 := More of you Czerka core-rats? Is even the heart of Kashyyyk not free from your kind?
12666 := For years I have hid, hoping to someday free my world! I swear you will not take me! I swear!
12667 := He is almost feral after all this time. Calm yourself, Freyyr. We are friends. Don't you remember me?
12668 := After years in the Shadowlands, I remember only that outsiders are not to be trusted! I'll see you dead!
12669 := Well, this may prove difficult.
12670 := I'll get back to you. Wait here.
12671 := I've decided to kill you for Chuundar!
12672 := You mind your own business! I've made my decision.
12673 := You are hardly a competent moral guide. Why question me?
12674 := Fine, I'll talk to Freyyr and think about it.
12675 := I have found the blade of Bacca's sword.
12676 := Actually, I was mistaken.
12677 := Wait a minute. What's in it for me?
12678 := Here, take it. I'm sure it is the one.
12679 := Yes, time to take the fight to Chuundar himself!
12680 := We should proceed carefully.
12681 := I have other questions.
12682 := Back to my previous questions.
12683 := I'm looking for something called a Star Map.
12684 := I found a computer. Know anything about it?
12685 := It clamins to be ancient. It created the forests.
12686 := Seen anyone hunting down here? Camouflaged attackers?
12687 := Chuundar sends his regards. Now die!
12688 := Back in line! I'm in charge here.
12689 := What would you suggest? He attacked us first.
12690 := This seems simple to me. Time to die, Freyyr!
12691 := What can I say to prove we aren't enemies?
12692 := I'm not here to kill you. Just listen!
12693 := That's enough. Just die, you old hairbag!
12694 := Do you know Zaalbar and Chuundar?
12695 := My name is <FullName>. Chuundar sent me to kill you.
12696 := I intend to!
12697 := Wait! I came here with Zaalbar.
12698 := My name is <FullName>. I came to Kashyyyk with Zaalbar.
12699 := It doesn't matter. It proves I am no common Czerka slaver.
12700 := No, he follows because of a life-debt.
12701 := Why would Chuundar want you dead now?
12702 := Go over exactly what happened with Zaalbar.
12703 := This bores me. I think I'll just kill you!
12704 := I've made my decision. The old fool dies!
12705 := You're my moral guide now? That's not your style.
12706 := Ah, shut up. I'll ask him a few more questions.
12707 := Well, what happens now?
12708 := How? Everyone is on his side.
12709 := What, a scavenger hunt for some sword? You're kidding.
12710 := Where might I find it?
12711 := And you still think you are worthy of being chieftain?
12712 := I will try to find it. Can you give me any direction?
12713 := Describe the creature. Where can I find it?
12714 := Actually, I've already found it. I wasn't sure what it was.
12715 := Back to my other questions.
12716 := So Zaalbar was exiled. When did you learn the truth?
12717 := Rrragh... can anyone hear me? Bacca have mercy...
12718 := Help! Here... I am dying...
12719 := You return? Please, I am dying... can you heal me?
12720 := Rrraagh! Great Bacca, let this outsider be different than the slavers... I beg you... can you heal my wounds?
12721 := An attack... from nowhere. Please, I need to be healed. Can you?
12722 := Please... I need to be healed. I... am dying...
12723 := Outsider... like any other. I should expect nothing. Leave me to die... leave...
12724 := You must help him! This is not right!
12725 := Grrrgh... as you wish...
12726 := Please... try to help. Is there nothing... you can do? Please...
12727 := We must find some way to help. Anything.
12728 := I... I thank you. I would not have expected an outsider to aid me. Perhaps... perhaps you will help again?
12729 := My hunting party, all of them, killed without honor. I barely survived. I want the murderers to suffer the same.
12730 := You have already fought some of them. How can you claim it is not your problem? They may come for you next, waiting until you put your weapons away, like they attacked us.
12731 := I should have known not to expect much from an outsider. I will find them on my own... as weak as I am.
12732 := They followed us for a long while. We found bodies to the southwest, and then again further south after the west branch of the path. Their speed was amazing.
12733 := They became camouflaged as I watched. What kind of creature can blend so naturally with the background? They were like ghosts.
12734 := I've never seen their kind before, not even among the Czerka. You saw them, armored head to toe, yet blending with the forest.
12735 := They fought like outsiders, waiting until we were unarmed. They would not attack until we had put our weapons away! They strike like cowards!
12736 := I thank you. I will wait here. I am too weak to fight them again, but I refuse to leave the Shadowlands unless vengeance is sated.
12737 := Please, if you kill them, I will reward you with whatever I can. They are not worthy of life.
12738 := You return... have you found them? Did you kill them all? They were animals in armor, with no honor among them.
12739 := I should have expected this from you, outsider. Cowardice disguised. You can walk away, but I will stay and fight.
12740 := I am just the kind of target they like... wounded... helpless. I will fight to my last breath. Leave me.
12741 := I thank you. These creatures, they have no honor. Let their blood feed the Shadowlands.
12742 := Yes... yes I see the trophy helmet from the one that gave orders. Their bodies will not last long in the Shadowlands. I am glad.
12743 := The taint of them, their cowardice... the forest will consume it all. I hope this gives my hunting brethren peace.
12744 := You have surprised me with your help; don't spoil this meeting with your outsider greed when I would give you a reward anyway.
12745 := Yes, they atacked you as well, didn't they? I never thought I would be on the same side as an outsider. It is a strange feeling.
12746 := You have acted as a fellow Wookiee would have. Here, take this. It is the symbol of my hunting clan. You served them, so you deserve it.
12747 := When you look at it, remember that we reward respect, even from outsiders.
12748 := This one is different. This one acts for us.
12749 := Don't speak to me, mad-claw. Chuundar must have allowed you to return to Kashyyyk, but I remember you as a mad-claw.
12750 := This outsider has shown honor through action. I will grant a reward because of this, not because you attempt to speak for them.
12751 := Outsider, you have acted as a fellow Wookiee would have. Here, take this. It is the symbol of my hunting clan. You served them, so you deserve it.
12752 := I am not ready to accept your word, Zaalbar. I remember you as a mad-claw. Let me make my own judgment of this person.
12753 := Wait... you have helped in avenging my fellows. I must acknowledge that, even though you are an outsider and are not to be truly trusted.
12754 := Why should I help you? Why are you worthy?
12755 := What happened here?
12756 := That is no answer. I refuse to help, weakling.
12757 := Don't question me. Remember your life debt.
12758 := I don't have the means to help him.
12759 := Very well. here, this should help.
12760 := I don't have the means to heal you.
12761 := I have the means to heal you. Here.
12762 := This is not my problem.
12763 := Where have they gone?
12764 := What can you tell me about your attackers?
12765 := I'll look into it.
12766 := I'm not going to bother with this.
12767 := No, I'll get back at it.
12768 := The Mandalorian hunters are dead. I killed them all.
12769 := Yes, yes, heartwarming. Where is my reward?
12770 := I would have killed them anyway.
12771 := I hope it does. Goodbye.
12772 := You have interrupted our hunt, interloper. The inhabitants of this world could do little against us, but you appear to be a threat.
12773 := Our training here will continue... without your interference.
12774 := More than a threat enough for you!
12775 := Another Mandalore, is it? Will you draw arms against those you would serve? We'll see who lives this day!
12776 := Your butchery will stop here!!
12777 := You are nothing! Your people are sheep! I fear no slave! Especially willing ones!
12778 := Has something happened to put fire in your people? Are you no longer slaves? It doesn't matter. You will die like the others!
12779 := ACCESS DENIED! SYSTEMS COMPROMISED!
POWER CELL OUTPUT: 200%

12883 := I must be on my way, sentient. My ship leaves very soon.
12884 := If you are wise, you will avoid the Sith on this planet, sentient. They do as they wish and many are killed without regret.
12885 := Taris has been destroyed. This portends ill for the future, sentient.
12886 := There is a building called the cantina which is a place of recreation.
12887 := Many sentients come to this planet to attempt to enter the Sith academy. I understand most die in the process. How unfortunate.
12888 := I have only recently come to this planet, myself. My apologies if I cannot help you.
12889 := This planet is controlled by the Sith. They are the supreme law here, and I suggest you be wary of them.
12890 := I must go to the office of the Czerka company. That is where business is transacted.
12891 := Excuse me, sentient. I do not think it wise to speak to you.
12892 := I am Mika Dorin, manager of this establishment. Is there something you are needing, sentient? The owner of the Ebon Hawk is always welcome in the Dresdae Cantina.
12893 := As you desire, sentient.
12894 := What would you like to know, sentient?
12895 := Could you be more specific, sentient? What manner of Star Map do you seek?
12896 := It may be possible, sentient. The only artifacts I have ever heard mentioned are in relation to the Sith and their Valley of the Dark Lords.
12897 := There is a place on the surface of this planet called the Valley of the Dark Lords, I believe, where the Sith dig amongst such ruins. Perhaps what you seek is there.
12898 := Very little. None are allowed in their ruins other than the Sith themselves, as I understand it.
12899 := I am afraid not. The Sith have a passage that leads to their valley from within their monastery, but only they may use it.
12900 := The Sith built their academy here to train students. Many go to train there, though I know not why. Most are not permitted to train and many die in their attempt to be admitted.
12901 := Many of their students and sometimes the Sith, themselves, come to my cantina. Look around and you will see them. I have little choice as to their presence.
12902 := This cantina has been provided by the Czerka Corporation, and it is a quiet place. This is as I prefer it. Elsewhere in Dreshdae it is not always safe or quiet. Dreshdae is run as the Sith wish.
12903 := The Sith are not always pleasant in their dealings with others. If I had a say, I would prefer they and their academy were not present here. But I do not.
12904 := Of course, sentient. Allow me to offer you a sample of the local ale.
12905 := No, nothing.
12906 := Just some questions answered.
12907 := That's all for now.
12908 := Do you know anything about a Star Map on Korriban?
12909 := The very old kind. Perhaps the Sith's excavations involve something like it?
12910 := The very old kind. Perhaps you know of some ruins on Korriban?
12911 := What can you tell me about the Sith's excavations?
12912 := Surely there must be some way to go there.
12913 := What do you know about the Sith academy?
12914 := Anything interesting going on here?
12915 := A drink.
12916 := I can't wait to get back to the Core systems. This planet is dangerous with all those Sith wandering around.
12917 := I hear them Sith are doing some kind of digging up on the planet's surface. How weird is that?
12918 := Whatever you do, don't try and land a ship outside of the colony. The Sith will destroy you without a second thought.
12919 := Have you heard what happened to Taris? I can't believe the Sith are powerful enough to do that.
12920 := The Czerka cantina's the only place to go around here for any real fun.
12921 := Are you a smuggler? That's the only way we get some decent goods to buy in this sector.
12922 := I hear you arrived on that old smuggling ship... the Hawk, or something like that?
12923 := Are you new to Korriban?
12924 := You're not here to try and get into the Sith academy, are you? Most of the poor fools who try are killed by the Sith. It's horrible!
12925 := There are a lot of young folk who come here hoping to get admitted to the Sith academy here in Dreshdae. Few ever do.
12926 := This planet belongs to the Sith. They allow Czerka to run the starport and a few mines, but the Sith are the ones in control.
12927 := Err... you're a Sith, right? Excuse me...
12928 := *Sigh* I can't wait to get back to the Core systems. This planet is dangerous with all these Sith wandering around.
12929 := I hear them Sith are doing some kind of digging up on the planet's surface. How weird is that?
12930 := Whatever you do, don't try and land a ship outside the colony. The Sith will destroy you without a second thought.
12931 := Have you heard what happened to Taris? I can't believe the Sith are powerful enough to do that.
12932 := Yeah, the Czerka cantina's the only place to go around here for any real fun.
12933 := Are you a smuggler? That's the only way we get some decent goods to buy in this sector.
12934 := I hear you arrived on that old smuggling ship... the Hawk, or something like that?

12938 := This planet belongs to the Sith. They allow Czerka to run the starport and a few mines, but the Sith are the ones in control.
12939 := Err... you're a Sith, right? *ahem* Excuse me...
12940 := I hear the Sith are digging up old artifacts in some valley up on the surface. I wonder what that's all about?
12941 := Ah, wish they had a band, here. Place is dull as an asteroid.
12942 := There are folk who come from all over Sith space looking to get into the monastery here to be trained. Only a few of them ever get chosen, however.
12943 := If you see one of them Sith wandering around outside of the monastery, just look away. They rule this planet and they do as they like.
12944 := Just having a drink, friend, minding my own business.
12945 := Please avoid the Sith academy... unless you are a hopeful, naturally.
12946 := Oh, entertainment can be found at the local cantina, provided by Czerka of course.
12947 := You can conduct business at our office, if you wish.
12948 := This is a Sith colony. They are the law here. I am here only to protect Czerka interests.
12949 := Go about your business, please, citizen.
12950 := Greetings and welcome to Czerka Corporation.
12951 := Do come again.
12952 := Certainly.
12953 := Czerka sends freighters to the surface every now and again to ferry artifacts to the Core.
12954 := The men are not allowed out of their ships, however, as only Sith are allowed on the surface. Beyond that I really can't say.
12955 := [Success] They... they call the site the Valley of the Dark Lords. Ancient Sith are buried in tombs there, along with many artifacts of old... some of great power, apparently.
12956 := I don't know anything else. Neither will you, I'm sure... only the Sith students are allowed access to the site.
12957 := [Failure] Does it matter? I don't intend to speak of it, regardless.
12958 := [Success] Well... all I know is that they call the site the Valley of the Dark Lords. Apparently, there are Sith Lords of old buried in tombs there.
12959 := Not much. The Sith are a rather secretive lot, and they don't allow many into the academy. I hear they claim that Korriban was inhabited long ago by other Sith.
12960 := But no one truly knows if that's true. The planet is certainly uninhabited outside of Dreshdae and always has been.
12961 := Only prospective students. We get many who come here each year, hoping to get picked. Many are simply considered too weak, I'm afraid.
12962 := I understand there is one main person amongst the Sith who decides which students are worthy... Yuthura Ban, I believe her name is.
12963 := Other than in the academy itself, I'm sorry, I don't know.
12964 := That would explain why this place is so creepy. This whole planet makes my head-tails twitch!
12965 := A Star Map? We sell navigational components, if that's what you mean.
12966 := Well... the Sith have some old ruins that interest them up on the surface of the planet. If this map of yours is there, however, they've said nothing about it.
12967 := There truly isn't much to tell, citizen. Dreshdae was established by the Sith, and we arrived to take advantage of some of the planet's mineral wealth.
12968 := The only thing that's really unusual about Dreshdae, I suppose, is that the Sith built their academy on the east side of the colony. You don't find those just anywhere.
12969 := We do some mining here and are responsible for local shipping and support of the Sith on Korriban.
12970 := Our starport is mostly just freighters and such, but we do get many travelers that come here to learn from the Sith.
12971 := This office is actually our administrative headquarters for this region. Rather inauspicious, isn't it? We offer good prices here to those traders that keep the colony supplied.
12972 := If you're in need of anything, this is the place to come.
12973 := Well why not? This is Sith space now, and the company has to survive regardless of who is in charge. The Republic, the Sith, eh... the economy has to keep going.
12974 := Now, was there anything else?
12975 := Profit at any cost... just like on my world.
12976 := I'm not sure what your pet is muttering, but keep a restraining collar on it. It won't last long if it gets loose. Now, was there something else?
12977 := You certainly can. Allow me to punch up our stock.
12978 := I must say... Czerka is in need of droids right now. That's a mighty fine-looking one you have there...
12979 := *angry mechanical spluttering*
12980 := I must say... Czerka is in need of droids right now. That's a mighty fine-looking one you have there...
12981 := Objection: This unit is not for sale, meatbag.
12982 := Errr... yes, of course, no offense meant. Heh. Touchy, isn't it?
12983 := Greetings again, citizen. Something you need?
12984 := I understand you're receiving training at the monastery, citizen. Congratulations!
12985 := Tsk. I suppose you've heard about the destruction of Taris, yes? Awful business, that. Czerka lost a fortune there, not that the Sith care.
12986 := Hmm. Aren't you the human who won the swoop race on Manaan? Congradulations and well done! It was most exciting to watch!
12987 := It is an honor to have you in our offices. How may Czerka serve you?
12988 := If you've come for any medical supplies, I have to warn you that the kolto source on Manaan has been poisoned.
12989 := It's a tragedy, considering the war and all... casualties are going to go through the roof. Czerka is pulling all its kolto out of storage as we speak.
12990 := Greetings. You've heard of that awful business on Edean, yes? Our corporate outpost there has been destroyed by the Wookiee savages.
12991 := This could put back the use of Wookiee labor considerably. We may even have to abandon the planet completely.
12992 := Ah, well. What can you do? Sorry... was there something you needed?
12993 := Yeah, I sure bet the Wookiees would hate to see ya go.
12994 := Well, certainly. Now they are doomed to remain savages forever... or possibly become extinct. Very sad. Now then... was there something you needed?
12995 := You make our freedom sound like a tragedy.
12996 := I see you got one of your own early. May as well, while you can. Now then... was there something I could do for you?
12997 := Greetings. If you haven't heard, there's some trouble over at the academy. A power struggle, most likely, but news is sketchy. So... anything Czerka can do for you?
12998 := I'll be going.
12999 := Can I ask you some questions about the colony?
13000 := How can one reach the ruins on the surface?
13001 := [Force Persuade] It is very important that you tell me what you know.
13002 := [Persuade] Can't say or don't know?
13003 := What do you know about the Sith academy?
13004 := Who is allowed in the academy?
13005 := Where do I find this Yuthura?
13006 := Have you ever heard of a Star Map?
13007 := No, I mean as in old ruins.
13008 := What can you tell me about the colony?
13009 := What does Czerka do here on Korriban?
13010 := Czerka works with the Sith?
13011 := Can I see what you have to offer?
13012 := If you must know, I intend to take the first ship off of this rock. Why should that interest you? I trust you got whatever you wanted from the tombs?
13013 := Then leave me be.
13014 := She and I were... students together at Dantooine, for a time. We were close, and we shared doubts about the Jedi's ways. I left for the Sith because I thought it would be better here.
13015 := It looks like Juhani changed her mind and stayed with the Jedi after all. Your doing, maybe? Anyway... I'm done with the Jedi, the Sith... and with her. Just leave me alone.
13016 := Why don't you ask her?
13017 := Is there some reason you should stop me from going? Are you afraid I'm going to tell someone you're here? What are you going to do, kill me?
13018 := I may have studied with the Sith, but I've no special loyalty to them. You can believe me or not, as you wish.
13019 := Fine. Let's end it here, then. It looks like you belong amongst the Sith more than I ever did.
13020 := Leave him be! I said that he would not betray you. Just... let him go.
13021 := Still sticking up for me, Juhani?
13022 := Just... go, Dak.
13023 := I already said, didn't I? I don't want to still be around when they start asking questions about you.
13024 := Why do you care? I've no intention of opposing you.
13025 := Perhaps I'll go back to Dantooine. Or just somewhere where there's no Sith or Jedi, period.
13026 := Perhaps... you could go back to the Jedi. I did.
13027 := I don't know. I'll think about it. Just leave me alone, Juhani.
13028 := Never mind.
13029 := How do you know Juhani?
13030 := Because I asked you.
13031 := What if I said I'm not going to just let you leave?
13032 := I suppose not. Just go, then.
13033 := How do I know I can trust you not to betray me?
13034 := Then I suppose I'll believe you.
13035 := Then I'm afraid I have to kill you.
13036 := That's exactly what I'm going to do.
13037 := Why are you leaving, exactly?
13038 := But where will you go?
13039 := Those Sith are about. Probably even watching us in here. Don't bet they ain't.
13040 := Don't go near that Sith place. They won't let you in, and them Sith will probably shoot you before they look at you.
13041 := Most of the merchants head over to Czerka's headquarters if they want to do some trading.
13042 := There isn't much to do in Dreshdae except have a drink until your ship's ready to go.
13043 := I'm just here on one of Czerka's transports. I don't have no business with you.
13044 := I've had two friends killed by the Sith already. It must be some kind of test... I'll survive and make it into the academy, I know it!
13045 := You'd better be careful around some of those Sith. They'll eliminate any prospects just to remove a potential future threat!
13046 := Do you know where I can find Yuthura Ban? I understand she's the one who determines if you are accepted into the academy or not.
13047 := Can you imagine if I actually became a Sith? The power I'd have! I could do anything!!
13048 := When one of the Sith thinks you're ready for the academy, he gives you a medallion. I wish I had one of those...
13049 := If you're looking to get into the academy, you're going to have a tough time. There's lots of us here trying to get accepted.
13050 := Hey! You've got one of the medallions! You've been accepted! How did you ever manage that?!
13051 := You are so lucky. You got accepted into the academy, didn't you? I'm beginning to think I never will. *sigh*
13052 := I've had two friends killed by the Sith already. It must be some kind of test... I'll survive and make it into the academy, I know it!
13053 := You'd better be careful around some of those Sith. They'll eliminate any prospects just to remove a potential future threat!
13054 := Do you know where I can find Yuthura Ban? I understand she's the one who determines if you are accepted into the academy or not.
13055 := Can you imagine if I actually became a Sith? The power I would have! I could do anything!!
13056 := When one of the Sith thinks you're ready for the academy, he gives you a medallion. I wish I had one of those...
13057 := If you're looking to get into the academy, you're going to have a tough time. There's lots of us here trying to get accepted.
13058 := Hey! You've got one of the medallions! You've been accepted! How did you ever manage that?!
13059 := You are so lucky. You got accepted into the academy, didn't you? I'm beginning to think I'm never going to make it.
13060 := One of Korriban's primary trade routes went through Taris. Now that it's destroyed, the colony here will have an even harder time of it.
13061 := I suppose you've heard about Taris being destroyed? The Republic must have pushed the Sith into it, that's what I think.
13062 := The Sith blew up Taris, the entire planet. I guess they must have deserved it... but that's so many people...
13063 := Can you imagine? The Wookiee slaves on Edean have gone insane and started attacking the Czerka outpost there. It must be horrific!
13064 := One of my friends in Czerka said that they've been driven off Edean by those Wookiee creatures. Barbaric beasts!
13065 := I heard something about the Wookiees on Edean suddenly revolting. Do you know anything about that?
13066 := The kolto reserves are all gone. That means the casualties in this war are going to become horrifying!
13067 := I bet the Republic is responsible for the loss of the kolto on Manaan. Yes they...they just want to keep it out of the hands of the Sith, I'm sure of it.
13068 := Have you heard? The kolto on Manaan has been poisoned... completely ruined. That's terrible news with the war still underway.
13069 := Aren't you the Manaan swoop champion? I figured you'd have gone to another sector by now, one with an actual circuit up and running.
13070 := It's not often I get a chance to meet such a fine swoop racer. You won on Manaan, right?
13071 := You look... familiar. Aren't you the one who won the swoop championship on Manaan? Too bad the circuit's dead or you could go pro.
13072 := I hear the Sith in the academy are fighting each other. Hope they don't blow it up around themselves, or the colony will go with them!
13073 := There's some kind of power struggle going on at the Sith academy, I hear. Nothing unusual for those Sith, I guess.
13074 := I suppose you've heard? The heads of the Sith academy have disappeared. Something is going on, I'm sure of it.
13075 := Look here, my dear friends... we have a newcomer to our little colony. I don't believe I've seen this one before, have you?
13076 := Look here, my dear friends... we have a group of newcomers to our little colony. I don't believe I've seen any of them before, have you?
13077 := Looks pretty fresh to me, Lashowe.
13078 := That's what I thought. Well, stranger... I don't know whether you're aware of this or not, but here on Korriban the Sith do as they please. And we are Sith.
13079 := Quite literally, whether you live or die depends upon our whim. What do you think of that, hmm?
13080 := Oh, neither do I. I simply stated a fact. Do you know how many Sith there are in Dreshdae?
13081 := Enough to crush this fool! Let's do it, Lashowe!
13082 := Beep-beep boop boop.
13083 := Is this a raffle? How many guesses do we get?
13084 := Do not provoke them, Carth.
13085 := Are you mad? Don't provoke them!
13086 := Not enough to save your sorry self.
13087 := Twelve? No, wait, thirteen!
13088 := Nice one, old man.
13089 := Thank you. It takes effort to be properly irreverent at my age.
13090 := Those are very brave words for such an insignificant person. Do you not realize how many Sith are here in Dreshdae?
13091 := Let me kill this one, Lashowe! Let me do it!
13092 := Now, now, let's not be hasty. Perhaps our friend here could yet offer up some amusement.
13093 := Beep-beep boop boop.
13094 := Is this a raffle? How many guesses do we get?
13095 := Do not provoke them, Carth.
13096 := Are you mad? Don't provoke them!
13097 := Not enough to save your sorry self.
13098 := Twelve? No, wait, thirteen!
13099 := Nice one, old man.
13100 := Thank you. It takes effort to be properly irreverent at my age.
13101 := Commentary: That's the way to tell the meatbags, master! Charging weapons, just in case. This should be fun!
13102 := How precocious. I think this one tried to make a joke, don't you?
13103 := I didn't think it was funny.
13104 := Neither did I. A brave face, perhaps, but I'm more interested in being amused at the moment, I think.
13105 := What do you say? Amuse us. Make us laugh, and we just might consider allowing you to live.
13106 := Ahhh, I hate this kind of whining. Do they always have to beg for mercy?
13107 := Yeah, let's get out of here.
13108 := Very well, boys. I'm sure we can find something more exciting than these... dead fish. Let's go.
13109 := Feh...
13110 := Commentary: Ohhh, master. I am so disappointed in you right now. No, don't look at me.
13111 := Oh? I see. We'll just have to see about that, won't we?
13112 := Ha ha! Looks like this one's not afraid of you at all, Lashowe.
13113 := Are you going to let us be insulted?!
13114 := Oh, get over yourself already. I'm tired of this.
13115 := Yeah, this one's got some backbone, at least. Let's go.
13116 := Fine. I'll deal with *you* later.
13117 := Go on.
13118 := I've heard this one before, I think...
13119 := Quiet!
13120 := And then?
13121 := [Failure] Heh! That's the oldest joke in the book.
13122 := Well, it certainly didn't amuse us, did it? Try again.
13123 := [Success] Hah! Too funny!
13124 := Ha ha ha! Good one!
13125 := Yes, I suppose that wasn't too bad. Alright then, my friend... you've done as you were asked. Perhaps we will meet again.
13126 := It would be more realistic if the commander just shot them both.
13127 := Cute. Maybe you should try juggling next time.
13128 := Ha ha ha! I like that one.
13129 := What?!
13130 := Heh... ha ha! I think someone just stood up to you, Lashowe.
13131 := Shut up, fool! Unless you want to be next!
13132 := Yeah? Anytime!
13133 := Stop it, this is boring. Let's just go back to the academy.
13134 := Fine, we'll go. As for you... I'll find you later. Trust me on that.
13135 := You took an incredible risk. You know that, right?
13136 := Be careful! You don't want to provoke them, do you?
13137 := Ah, you don't think they're a bit pre-provoked to begin with?
13138 := Don't be stupid. We needn't make matters worse.
13139 := You couldn't find your backside with both hands AND your friends'.
13140 := Well, if you'd seen us before, we wouldn't be newcomers, would we?
13141 := Ha-ha! Smart-mouthed newcomers, to boot.
13142 := Great, just what we needed. Some punks come to steal our lunch credits.
13143 := You should turn around and move along, kid. You don't want the trouble we'd give you.
13144 := Look here, my dear friends... we have a newcomer to our little colony. A Jedi, no less. I don't believe I've seen this one before, have you?
13145 := I hate Jedi... and these fallen ones are worse! They always get into the academy, and they think they're better than the rest of us!
13146 := Look here, my dear friends. We have some newcomers to the colony... led by a Jedi, no less. I don't believe I've seen any of them before, have you?
13147 := I don't think there's any need for hostilities.
13148 := I think that was a rhetorical question. But nice guess, Teethree.
13149 := You can try to kill me. You'd fail, but you can try.
13150 := I think that was a rhetorical question. But nice guess, Teethree.
13151 := I think that's a lot of responsibility for simple scum like you.
13152 := Please don't hurt me! I don't want a fight!
13153 := I'm not looking for trouble, but I'm not here to amuse you.
13154 := [Persuade] Err... okay. These two Mandalorians are out in the woods...
13155 := One of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other Mandalorian takes out his communicator and contacts his commander.
13156 := He gasps: "My partner has collapsed! I don't know what to do!" After a moment, the commander responds: "Calm down, I can help."
13157 := "First, let's make sure your partner is dead." There is a silence, then a blaster shot is heard. Back on the communicator, the Mandalorian says: "Okay, now what?"
13158 := Be careful. You might be heading for more trouble than you can handle.
13159 := Yeah, yeah, yeah.
13160 := It worked, didn't it?
13161 := Nice to see the Hawk's still in one piece. Beauty of a ship, that.
13162 := Yep. Take care, now.
13163 := You sure can.
13164 := A Star Map? You mean like a navigation chart?
13165 := There's a whole bunch of old Sith ruins up on the surface of the planet. That's why they put one of their academies here, to dig them all up.
13166 := If them Sith found a Star Map in those ruins, nobody's ever mentioned it.
13167 := Not much. It's a pretty barren planet, to tell the truth. Not of much interest to anyone. Unless you're a Sith, I guess... they seem to think this place is something special.
13168 := Probably all them ruins they found on the surface. That's the reason they built their academy here, I guess, to dig all them ruins up.
13169 := You don't. Not unless you're a Sith in the academy. They're the only ones allowed on the surface. They pay Czerka to ship things in and out, I guess, but that's all closely monitored.
13170 := I don't know. There's all kinds of hopefuls in the colony trying to get in... why don't you ask one of them?
13171 := There's people that come here from all over Sith space to try and join the academy. Most of them die, I hear. Pretty gruesome business, that.
13172 := Oh, I've seen this little ship before plenty of times. Used to make runs for the Exchange, didn't it? Korriban's nice and remote, the kind of place the Exchange likes. 
13173 := You don't need to worry about me saying anything. I don't give a whit what you do with your ship. Smuggling's what the Hawk was made for, though.
13174 := I knew we'd run into some of Davik's old associates sooner or later. No matter where you go somebody's working for the Exchange!
13175 := Oh, nobody special. I just do the routine maintenance work for the ships that come in. I used to see the Hawk here all the time.
13176 := Still around the starport, I see. Heading off, soon?
13177 := Thanks, I'll be going.
13178 := Can I ask you some questions?
13179 := Do you know how to reach the ruins on the surface?
13180 := What can you tell me about the Sith Academy?
13181 := Have you ever heard of a Star Map?
13182 := Yes, but much older. Are there ruins on Korriban?
13183 := Yes, but much older. Perhaps in the ruins?
13184 := What can you tell me about Korriban?
13185 := Why do the Sith think Korriban is special?
13186 := How does someone get to the ruins?
13187 := So how does someone get into the academy?
13188 := There's a Sith academy here?
13189 := How do you know about the Ebon Hawk?
13190 := Who are you?
13191 := I have to go.
13192 := Ha ha! Once you become a Sith, you can do anything! You can feel the power coursing through you! None of you fools can compare to me!!
13193 := P-please, friend... we are pleased at your success, but...
13194 := Pleased?! You're jealous! You're jealous of my power! You think you deserve this medallion, don't you? Well, let's just see!!
13195 := Ha ha ha! See?! I have the power to do anything!
13196 := Somebody help me!! Please!!
13197 := Sniveling fool! Like you would ever belong beside me in the academy! I'd rather kill you now and save us the trouble!
13198 := What's this? It seems I have an audience. Look, human... just keep walking, unless you want some of the same.
13199 := Oh, yeah? Well I just decided I don't need any witnesses. You look like a fun challenge, anyway, so this should be interesting!
13200 := Yeah? Well I just decided that Jedi make much better sport than anyone else here. Oh, this should be entertaining.
13201 := I am a Sith, now! My power is supreme! Prepare to die, ha ha!!
13202 := You can't stop me! You first, human, and then she dies!!
13203 := What's this? It seems I have an audience. Look, Jedi... just keep walking, unless you want some of the same.
13204 := Do what you want. It has nothing to do with me.
13205 := Yeah? Let's see how tough you are, then.
13206 := Sorry, but I'm not going to let you kill that woman.
13207 := Greetings, friend. Fellow pilot, are you? Wouldn't mind taking a spin in the Ebon Hawk, myself. Sleek ship, that one.
13208 := I never said it wasn't. Just would be nice to fly something with a bit of thrust, for once.
13209 := Oh, just a boring freighter. We've had some pretty steady work here, though, since the Sith started their excavations up on the surface.
13210 := In case you're forgetting, partner, they don't exactly want us talking about their business.
13211 := Ah, who cares about them? I've seen some of those things they're digging up in those ruins in the valley. Pretty creepy, if you ask me.
13212 := Sure thing. Good flying, friend.
13213 := It's in a valley on the surface, beyond some mountains to the east. No land route... that's why they have us fly in.
13214 := Shows what you know. The academy has a route through the mountain... that's how all their students get to the excavation site.
13215 := Well, regardless, the Sith don't let anybody near that valley. Even when we land, they watch us like a Drayberian hawk and want us gone quickly.
13216 := Not a chance. You'd be better off sneaking through the academy, if you wanted to go to the valley.
13217 := Hah! Now that'd be a sight to see.
13218 := Weird artifacts. Looks like alien stuff. Maybe aliens lived on Korriban a long time ago, who knows?
13219 := Don't be stupid. I was talking to one of those Sith and he said there are tombs there dating back to when the Sith were here in ancient times.
13220 := There were Sith here in ancient times? Sounds like he was feeding you a line. Korriban's only been settled for a short time.
13221 := So says you. He said that the planet was settled by the Sith a long time ago, and then they all left or something. Those tombs are really important to them.
13222 := Tombs, hey? That makes the stuff they send us even creepier. Wish I didn't have to haul it around.
13223 := No. We're not due for another shipment for at least another week.
13224 := We used to haul everything to Taris, and the Sith would take it off our hands there. Not sure where we'll be bringing it now.
13225 := In a small colony like this, everyone knows everyone's business.
13226 := It's better than thinking too much about all the Sith lurking about, here.
13227 := The Hawk's been in and out of here for ages. An out-of-the-way starport is a good place for, uh... privateers. Not saying you are one.
13228 := Sorry. Hard not to be interested. All we get to do is freighter work, though the Sith certainly provide a lot of that.
13229 := Wouldn't make any difference to me. Just wish I had a ship like that, myself. Business is steady here with the Sith, but it's a boring haul.
13230 := Nice to see you again. Hold onto that Hawk... it'll do well by you.
13231 := Well, forget it. The Hawk's my ship.
13232 := What kind of ship do you pilot?
13233 := I'll be going.
13234 := How would one get to these excavations, exactly?
13235 := So no one could sneak into the valley by ship?
13236 := What have they been digging up?
13237 := Do you have any of these artifacts, now?
13238 := Where do you take these things?
13239 := Does everyone here know about the Ebon Hawk?
13240 := How about you mind your own business?
13241 := I'm not a smuggler, if that's what you mean.
13242 := And what if I am?
13243 := You own the Ebon Hawk, don't you? Wish I could fly a bird like that.
13244 := Our ship will be ready soon. Then it's off to Coruscant for a week or so.
13245 := Can I help you?
13246 := A pleasure to see the owner of the Ebon Hawk. The docking fee, for you, is only 25 credits.
13247 := Greetings, greetings. I see the, ah, Ebon Hawk has returned to tiny Dreshdae, has it? Good, good.
13248 := Since you're a regular to our little colony, the docking fee is only 25 credits.
13249 := Enjoy your stay in Dreshdae.
13250 := Well, we do have to maintain the starport. You can't expect to use our meager facilities and not pay, can you?
13251 := [Success] I suppose you are correct. It won't hurt anything if I just let you on through.
13252 := [Failure] Of course it's necessary. If you use our facilities, a few credits is not too much to ask, is it?
13253 := [Success] Ahhh, I suppose there is no need to charge the owner of the Ebon Hawk any fee, really. I'll open the door for you.
13254 := Excellent. Continue on through. Please be aware that the colony is under Sith jurisdiction... I'd advise you to stay out of their way.
13255 := What information do you wish?
13256 := The ones on the surface? All I know is that only the Sith students go there, sorry.
13257 := Unless you're one of the hopefuls who is trying to become a student there, I suggest you avoid it. The Sith are the law here and do as they please. It can be quite... dangerous.
13258 := Err... doesn't your computer handle navigation? Beyond that, I really couldn't say.
13259 := Well, this is Dreshdae... it's the only colony on the planet. Korriban is a Sith planet, well within their space, though it's not very well-inhabited.
13260 := The Sith allow Czerka to conduct some mining here, and the company operates the starport... but otherwise the colony revolves around the local Sith academy.
13261 := Czerka is one of the largest corporations in the Core... I'm surprised you haven't heard of it. They have interests in mining all over this sector.
13262 := Korriban is actually the location of Czerka's headquarters for this sector. Most business here in the colony is conducted there.
13263 := Hmph! Wherever you find the Sith, Czerka isn't far away. Like granite slugs on a sky tower.
13264 := More like a disease.
13265 := But of course. There was a time when that ship used to dock here on a weekly basis. It's changed hands, then, has it? Ah, well, that happens.
13266 := Ahhh, I see, I see. Another Jedi come to small Korriban, yes? Good to meet you.
13267 := There are many people who come to Korriban from throughout Sith space, hoping to join the academy. Some of them are Jedi who have left the order.
13268 := You will get into the academy for certain. I understand Jedi who have left the light side are made very welcome.
13269 := Oh... I... I see. Then... then this is a very dangerous place for you to have come. Korriban is a Sith planet... you know that, correct?
13270 := Oh? I thought that would have been why you came here. There is a Sith academy just outside of Dreshdae where they train their students and such.
13271 := But enough about that. It is very nice to see that the Ebon Hawk has returned. I have not seen that ship for some time, indeed.
13272 := Ah. I assumed you were perhaps a Jedi from the distinctive robes you are wearing. My mistake.
13273 := Ah. I assumed you were perhaps a Jedi from the lightsaber you are carrying. My mistake.
13274 := Well, ah, from the robes you are wearing, of course. They are quite distinctive.
13275 := Well, ah, from the lightsaber you are carrying, naturally. Only Jedi carry ones like that, correct?
13276 := I'll be on my way.
13277 := I don't have enough to pay the fee...
13278 := [Force Persuade] You don't need to collect the fee.
13279 := [Persuade] That's not really necessary, is it?
13280 := Here's the 25 credits.
13281 := Can I ask you some questions?
13282 := What do you know about the Sith's excavations?
13283 := What can you tell me about the Sith academy?
13284 := Have you ever heard of a Star Map?
13285 := Tell me about Korriban.
13286 := Tell me about Czerka.
13287 := You know of the Ebon Hawk?
13288 := Jedi come here often, do they?
13289 := But I haven't left the light side!
13290 := What's this academy you mention?
13291 := So I imagine.
13292 := You're wrong. I am no Jedi.
13293 := How do you know I'm a Jedi?
13294 := What do you want?
13295 := Alright. Goodbye.
13296 := May the Force serve you well.
13297 := There's not much I could tell you. Unless you're a hopeful... are you?
13298 := There are people who come here all the time to try to get into the Sith academy. I'm one of them.
13299 := I'm trying to get into the Sith academy. Around here they call us 'hopefuls'.
13300 := *sigh* I wish I knew, to tell you the truth. You have to impress one of the Sith, I guess. Either way, it's Yuthura Ban who makes the final decision.
13301 := She's a Twi'lek Sith master, I hear. Very high rank. She's the one who decides which hopefuls make it and which ones don't.
13302 := I really couldn't say. I hear that sometimes she comes out into the colony to drink at the cantina, though, but I guess she could be anywhere.
13303 := I thought they were good... but I've been here for days, now, and I haven't drawn any attention at all.
13304 := I suppose that might be good, I don't know. Some of the 'attention' the Sith have shown to other hopefuls has been pretty... deadly.
13305 := After the Sith conquer the galaxy there aren't going to be any more Jedi, are there? I guess I'd rather join the winning side.
13306 := Well... that's the only way to become a Sith, isn't it? In the academy you learn to use the Force.
13307 := You... you have a medallion!
13308 := Oh... yes. Sorry.
13309 := I doubt I could take it from you if I tried. Good luck in your training, I suppose.
13310 := No. You're very lucky, that's all I meant.
13311 := Why would you ask that? The Sith who gave you that must have mentioned that it represented your acceptance. All you have to do is bring it to Yuthura Ban at the cantina and you're in!
13312 := Might you have any advice for me? How did you obtain it?
13313 := So there *is* a secret to it. I knew there had to be!
13314 := Would you tell me what it is? I'll do anything to know!
13315 := [Failure] My family couldn't talk me out of this, and you sure aren't going to. Thanks anyway.
13316 := [Success] I... but... oh, you're right. It's hopeless.
13317 := *sigh* I... I guess I should go home. Perhaps I could get a job at the droid shop...
13318 := Too bad that's exactly where we're headed.
13319 := [Failure] Jump in the chasm? Do I look like an idiot? No thanks.
13320 := [Success] R-really? *gulp!* That... that sounds like it's very dangerous. You survived it, though... maybe it isn't so bad...
13321 := You should not do this. Taking advantage, even of a Sith, leads to the dark side.
13322 := If a Sith told you to go jump off a cliff, would you?
13323 := That is beside the point.
13324 := That is murder, and this young person is not even a Sith!
13325 := [Failure] Take a medallion that doesn't belong to me? I doubt that would work. But thank you regardless.
13326 := [Success] Hmm... I suppose that might work. A newly accepted student wouldn't have all the powers of the other Sith, would they? Thank you!
13327 := [Failure] That sounds like it would be suicide. You are obviously lying to me.
13328 := [Success] Oh. I'm not much of a combatant... but I guess you have to be brave if you're going to get into the Sith, right? I'll... have to think about it.
13329 := So you're not going to tell me. *sigh* I suppose I really didn't expect you to.
13330 := I see. Well, keep your secrets to yourself, then. I'll find a way.
13331 := So you're already part of the academy. I am unimpressed.
13332 := You... are one of the Sith from the academy, yes? Would you happen to be looking for new prospects?
13333 := I'll be on my way.
13334 := Can I ask you some questions?
13335 := What do you mean?
13336 := Who are you?
13337 := How does someone get into the academy?
13338 := Where is this Yuthura Ban?
13339 := What do you think your chances are?
13340 := Why not join the Jedi?
13341 := Why would you want to get into the academy?
13342 := Get out of my way.
13343 := It's mine and you're not getting it.
13344 := That's right. Got a problem with that?
13345 := So? What does that mean?
13346 := Let's just say I didn't get this in the normal way.
13347 := Forget it. I'll be going, now.
13348 := [Persuade] You don't want to go through the academy. Trust me. Go home.
13349 := [Persuade/Lie] You must show your bravery by jumping in the chasm.
13350 := [Persuade] Take it from one of the other students, of course.
13351 := [Persuade/Lie] You have to attack one of the Sith for it.
13352 := You just have to keep trying, I guess.
13353 := Forget it. You'll never be worthy.
13354 := Something you need?
13355 := Yeah, go on.
13356 := May the Force serve you well.
13357 := Look, I'll answer questions if a Sith puts them to me, but not otherwise.
13358 := I mean I'm here to get into the academy, and I'll do whatever it takes to succeed.
13359 := Nobody you need to know. I'm just here to try to get into the Sith academy.
13360 := Well... you have to impress one of the Sith. The final decision rests with Yuthura Ban, however.
13361 := She's the one who decides exactly which of us get into the academy or not. I've been hanging out hoping she'll come by and notice me, to be honest.
13362 := Usually she's in the academy, but sometimes she comes out into the colony to look for prospects.
13363 := If she's in the colony, she can usually be found in the cantina, but not always. She's one of the most powerful Sith in the academy, I hear.
13364 := I don't know. I've been here for a few days now, and the Sith still haven't paid me any attention.
13365 := I suppose I should consider myself lucky. I've heard of some of the prospects getting killed. Still... it's all a test. I'll just have to be strong!
13366 := Hah! They're weaklings not worth anyone's attention! It's the Sith that are going to conquer the galaxy, after all.
13367 := Why? Why?! That's a really dumb question. To become a Sith, of course! To wield the greatest power in the galaxy!
13368 := Hey! You've got one of the medallions!
13369 := Oh... uh, yes of course.
13370 := If I thought I could take it... ahhh, no, never mind. Just go on and quit lording it over me, will you?
13371 := N-no, of course not! I wish I was as lucky as you, that's all.
13372 := What does that mean? It means that you've been accepted into the academy. All you have to do is bring that to Yuthura Ban in the cantina. Didn't the Sith who gave you that tell you?
13373 := Got any advice for someone who's trying to be worthy of admittance?
13374 := Oh? So... so there's some secret to it after all? I *knew* it!
13375 := Please, please tell me what I have to do! I'll do anything!
13376 := [Failure] You just want one less competitor, right? Well, we'll see about that.
13377 := [Success] I... but, ugh... I guess you're right. If I can't even figure this out, what hope do I have?
13378 := *sigh* I guess this is for the best. Maybe it's time to take up dew farming.
13379 := Well, too bad that's exactly where we're headed.
13380 := [Failure] Right. Do I look like I was born yesterday? Get lost.
13381 := [Success] R-really? That... that sounds like it's, heh, very dangerous. You survived it, though... maybe it isn't so bad...
13382 := You should not do this. Taking advantage, even of a Sith, leads to the dark side.
13383 := If a Sith told you to go jump off a cliff, would you?
13384 := That is beside the point.
13385 := That is murder, and this young person is not even a Sith!
13386 := [Failure] You're just trying to get me into trouble, aren't you? I'll pass, thanks anyway.
13387 := [Success] Hey! Why didn't I think of that? Hmmm... you look a bit too tough for me. I'll go and find someone a bit easier. Thanks a lot!
13388 := [Failure] That would be suicide. Trying to kill off the competition, huh? 'Thanks' for the tip.
13389 := [Success] That doesn't really sound so easy. I guess it's to prove how brave you are, right? They won't actually kill you? Hm. I guess I'll have to find out...
13390 := That is unworthy of you. And it draws unwanted attention.
13391 := Hmph. Fine. Keep your secrets to yourself. See if I care.
13392 := Oh really? What do you know, anyway? Get away from me.
13393 := Look, you've already got your ticket into the academy... there's no need to gloat, is there?
13394 := Uhh... greetings. You wouldn't happen to be looking for a prospect for the academy, would you?
13395 := I'll be on my way.
13396 := Can I ask you some questions?
13397 := What do you mean?
13398 := Who are you?
13399 := How does someone get into the academy?
13400 := Where is this Yuthura Ban?
13401 := What do you think your chances are?
13402 := Why not join the Jedi?
13403 := Why would you want to get into the academy?
13404 := Get out of my way.
13405 := It's mine and you're not getting it.
13406 := That's right. Got a problem with that?
13407 := So? What does that mean?
13408 := Let's just say I didn't get this in the normal way.
13409 := Forget it. I'll be going, now.
13410 := [Persuade] You don't want to go through the academy. Trust me. Go home.
13411 := [Persuade/Lie] You must show your bravery by jumping in the chasm.
13412 := [Persuade] Take it from one of the other students, of course.
13413 := [Persuade/Lie] You have to attack one of the Sith for it.
13414 := You just have to keep trying, I guess.
13415 := Forget it. You'll never be worthy.
13416 := No, that is the wrong answer. Again! You pathetic hopefuls can't possibly all be this stupid, can you?
13417 := P-please, Master Shaardan! Give us a chance! We'll do anything to get into the academy!
13418 := Hmph. I'm no master... yet... but I like the sound of that. Alright, one more question, though the lot of you are trying my patience.
13419 := Alright. Let's say you become a Sith and I am your commanding officer. I give you an order to spare the life of an enemy. Do you do it?
13420 := Oh, of course, Shaardan! Anything you command us!
13421 := We would never oppose you!
13422 := No, no, no. *sigh* Do you honestly believe that the Sith are in need of such sniveling cowards?
13423 := Mercy is a weakness. If your leader shows weakness, it is your duty to kill him and show true authority... true power. That is why the Sith are strong.
13424 := Th-thank you, Shaardan. We, uh... we understand now!
13425 := No, you don't understand. And you probably never will. You wouldn't survive five seconds in the academy... the other students would tear you apart!
13426 := Bah! I can't be bothered with fools! Perhaps... I should... hmmm.
13427 := You! You there! You have the look of someone not quite as dense as these hopefuls. I require your aid for a moment.
13428 := You! Jedi! You're looking to get into the academy, are you not? Of course you are... why else would you be here?
13429 := Let me pose a question to you. These hopefuls will never survive in the academy. A lesson must be taught, here, but I am at a loss as to what form it should take.
13430 := I'm thinking to spare them the effort of being killed and do it myself. Perhaps I shall turn their skin inside out? Or Force Lightning? It is a most impressive display.
13431 := Or perhaps a bit of humiliation is in order? I could easily strip off their tunics and make them run through the colony. Or they could lose all control of their bodily functions...
13432 := What do you think? I just can't seem to decide.
13433 := Please! Tell him to let us go, I beg you!!
13434 := Silence!!
13435 := Why not ask you? I'm rather exhausted from dealing with hopefuls like these, I can barely think straight. Besides... I find it fun. Come now, a decision please.
13436 := Hmph. You're as pathetic as they are, it looks like. Bah! I can't be bothered. Get out of here, all of you! The sight of you makes me sick to my stomach!
13437 := Let them go? And what could possibly convince me to do that?
13438 := Oh? My, but that is rather intrepid of you! I don't think I've had someone stand up to me like that in ages!
13439 := You see, boys? *This* is the kind of backbone you need if you ever want a hope of becoming a Sith. Now get out of my sight.
13440 := [Failure] Do you really think my mind is that weak? I'm practically insulted. Now instead of trying the easy way out, give me a real answer.
13441 := [Success] I... want to let them go. Yes, that's right. They're... not worth my time...
13442 := My head... what was that? I feel like... hmph. Just... get out of here. All of you. I don't have time for this.
13443 := [Failure] Now *that* has to be a first. Wrong, is it? Let me show you how wrong I think it is.
13444 := [Success] Ha ha ha ha! Now *that* has to be the funniest thing I've heard all day.
13445 := Well, fine, whoever you are... since you've proven such a good sport, the boys can run off. I'm sure your little lesson will give them something to chew on.
13446 := [Failure] No, I think it's you who isn't worth my time. Them I prefer to kill. Just feel lucky I don't squish you while I'm at it.
13447 := [Success] *sigh* I suppose not, but you're as boring as they are. Fine, fine... go on, all of you. Hopefully you've learned something, here.
13448 := You do? Hmmm. Perhaps having a bunch of hopefuls soiling themselves would be somewhat amusing. Let's see, shall we?
13449 := My thoughts exactly. How lovely to encounter someone with such an agreeable disposition.
13450 := Do not do this. Do not turn towards the dark side!
13451 := What? Why didn't you try to help them?!
13452 := Please! Help us!!
13453 := Silence!
13454 := Of course I can kill them. The Sith can do whatever they like on Korriban, and frankly these worms rather deserve it. That's for you to decide, however.
13455 := We didn't do anything!! Please! Help us!!
13456 := Silence!
13457 := It's not what they did so much as what they didn't do... which is prove themselves worthy. I'm exhausted from dealing with their mewlings... so please decide for me, will you?
13458 := Oh, this is rich.
13459 := Advisement: Evisceration works well. Electrocution and blunt trauma also work well, I understand.
13460 := Well, if you can't think of anything cruel you really shouldn't be out here, young man, should you?
13461 := I wasn't talking to you!
13462 := Why are you asking me?
13463 := No way. Leave me out of it.
13464 := Perhaps just... scare them a little.
13465 := Let them go. That's my decision.
13466 := Fine. Do whatever you like.
13467 := Because I'll kill you if you don't.
13468 := [Force Persuade] You want to let them go.
13469 := [Persuade] Killing them is wrong. You know that.
13470 := [Persuade] They aren't worth your time.
13471 := I think humiliation would be enough.
13472 := Kill them, I don't care.
13473 := You can't just kill them!
13474 := Why? What did they do?
13475 := What's this? Looks like we found ourselves a bit of sport, my friends.
13476 := This is good: I want to celebrate my acceptance into the academy!
13477 := Me too. So how about it, chump? Ready to die? I'm eager to blow off some steam after those tests.
13478 := Looks like we got us a winner!
13479 := You know it. Let's enjoy this!
13480 := I know I will!
13481 := Hey! I think that was a threat!
13482 := That's pretty funny. Why should we be scared of you?
13483 := [Failure] Okay, I've heard just about enough out of you. Get them!
13484 := Bring it on!
13485 := [Success] Uhhh... this one doesn't look like a pushover, you know. Maybe we should reconsider...
13486 := Yeah, okay. Just keep out of our way next time, you.
13487 := Hey! This one has killed Sith?!
13488 := You've picked the wrong place to say that. We'll score big points for bringing in your body, I'm sure!
13489 := Bring it on!
13490 := But we do, isn't it obvious?
13491 := [Success] Yeah... I don't want to fight you.
13492 := Hey! That... that's a Jedi trick!
13493 := What?! You... you won't get away with this!!
13494 := [Failure] I hate whining! Let's shut them up!
13495 := I'm all for that! Come on!
13496 := Bring it on!
13497 := [Success] Come on, man, let's just leave these losers alone.
13498 := Ahhh, alright. Let's go. Consider yourself lucky, stranger.
13499 := [Failure] What do you say, guys? Do we want a drink or not?
13500 := I say we take the creds off their bodies. Then get a drink.
13501 := Hey! Good plan!
13502 := Bring it on!
13503 := [Success] Hey, a drink sounds pretty good...
13504 := Yeah, it does. Okay, you're off the hook. Let's go, guys.
13505 := Ever notice how the Sith always act tough when they're in groups? Nothing but scum if you ask me!
13506 := Bring it on!
13507 := Are you sure you want to die?
13508 := [Persuade] Because I'm not a snot-nosed punk who's biting off more than he can chew.
13509 := Because I've killed plenty of Sith before now. Run along, boys.
13510 := Take another step and I'll show you.
13511 := I don't want to pick a fight here.
13512 := [Force Persuade] You don't want to fight me.
13513 := [Persuade] I'm trying to be reasonable... but if you keep pushing me you'll regret it.
13514 := [Persuade/Bribe] Here... here's 100 credits. Buy a drink to celebrate, instead.
13515 := Is there something you need, human? Make it good, for I have little patience.
13516 := As you wish.
13517 := I am sure there are plenty of others here who would answer your questions. I am quite busy. So if there is nothing else...?
13518 := I am. Obviously you have been told of me. Is it your desire, then, to train at the academy? Do you wish to become a Sith, human?
13519 := Who am I? You must not have been on Korriban for very long. Either that or you have been feeling your way about blindly.
13520 := Luckily for you, I am in a charitable mood. I am Yuthura Ban, second only to Master Uthar of the Sith academy here in Dreshdae.
13521 := I am the one who decides which few of the many hopefuls who travel here to train actually become a Sith. Why? Is it your desire to enter the academy? Is that why you are here?
13522 := Ahhh, so you are just another hopeful after all. Or are you? There is something odd about you that I cannot place...
13523 := I sense... that you are very strong in the Force. That you have already honed some of your abilities. Jedi training, is it?
13524 := What an odd thing to say... and, even stranger, I do not sense any deception within you. You are a curious puzzle, human, a puzzle with great power.
13525 := Perhaps none. Perhaps all the difference in the world. Either way, you possess enough raw power to intrigue me greatly.
13526 := With that kind of power, you could become a great Sith. Perhaps... if I let you. Does that interest you?
13527 := [Success] Ah, good. Exactly the sort of answer I was hoping for.
13528 := [Failure] I see. Somehow, however, I am unconvinced.
13529 := No, my friend... I'll not be the one to bring you into our academy. If one of the other Sith accept you and give you a medallion, then perhaps.
13530 := But otherwise... not today. Run along now.
13531 := [Success] Ah, good. Exactly the sort of answer I was hoping for.
13532 := I will take you to the academy and we shall see if you are ready to join the ranks of the Sith.
13533 := Are you ready to go there now?
13534 := I have only one other question. These... companions of yours? They will not be coming with you, I presume?
13535 := I see. Fair enough, so long as they do not disturb your training or cause any trouble. Are you ready to go to the academy, then?
13536 := Statement: Just a simple droid, here, ma'am. Nothing to see. Move along.
13537 := My hearing's not so good. I'm just pleased my nice master doesn't beat me so much anymore, yes sir.
13538 := I... yes -- we are only servants to the... master.
13539 := There is... something odd about this servant of yours...
13540 := No matter. Make sure they don't disturb your training or cause trouble. You are responsible for them. Now... are you ready to go to the academy?
13541 := [Success] Ah, good. Exactly the sort of answer I was hoping for.
13542 := [Failure] *chuckle* You must not think much of Sith masters to try that little trick. I won't hold it against you, however... it shows initiative.
13543 := But I do desire a real answer to my question... does it interest you?
13544 := A pity. Here I hadn't even decided, yet.
13545 := Well, human... should you change your mind, you know where to come.
13546 := A pity. And here you were already given the medallion and everything.
13547 := With that kind of power, you could become a great Sith. Perhaps... if I let you. Does that interest you?
13548 := Hmm. A strange response, indeed. Is your mind maladjusted in some way? You should make for an interesting pupil, indeed.
13549 := Ah, good. Exactly the sort of answer I was hoping for.
13550 := A Padawan, perhaps, though it makes little difference. I sense enough raw power within you to... well, we shall see.
13551 := As I thought. How interesting that they would let one with such power out of their grasp. Or are you here to spy on us? For all the good it would do.
13552 := *chuckle* As you wish. Keep your little secrets, human, if you must. Either way, I sense an intriguing amount of power within you.
13553 := *chuckle* As you wish. Play your little game, Jedi, if you must. Either way, I sense an intriguing amount of power within you.
13554 := Obviously you are a Jedi. One who is very strong in the Force, it seems. So were you part of the order for very long? Did they train you?
13555 := No? Why might that be? There is something... odd about you, human, that I cannot place...
13556 := And yet here you are on little Korriban, just by accident? I find it hard to believe. If it amuses you, however, I'll play along.
13557 := *chuckle* An interesting question, and not one I hear often. For most the benefits of becoming a Sith are quite obvious.
13558 := We wield ultimate power, my friend. To be a Sith is to taste freedom and to know victory. Nothing is as glorious as bending the Force to your will.
13559 := I would consider that an amusing ploy to try and enter the Academy. Why? Who will you claim to be? Darth Malak, himself?
13560 := What about Revan? Revan is dead. You may have a natural gift with the Force, human, but you've no gift for lies.
13561 := You know the name? Malak is the strongest of us, and the strongest always rules... at least until one who is stronger can take it from him.
13562 := That is our way: survival of the fittest. You are always on guard, always lean for the kill. We promote it, for through this the Sith are stronger.
13563 := If a Sith has proven to be weak... and if the time is right. The Force rewards the cunning and the mighty. Step up to the challenge if you dare... or turn tail and run.
13564 := It is the Jedi who serve the Force... trying to discern its wishes like frightened old men staring at the stars. The Force serves *us*.
13565 := We shape it to our will. We are its master. The Jedi deny their darkness, but we revel in it, we allow it to fuel our strength.
13566 := 'Corruption' is a word the pitiful use to describe the natural longing for power that they deny. 'Evil' is a word trumpeted by the weak to ease their heart.
13567 := It is true that the Force exacts a physical toll on some... but not a single one of them has ever regretted it. Anything else you hear is propaganda.
13568 := Hide-bound relics who burden themselves with tradition and with the protection of the weak and ungrateful. They are pitiful and misguided.
13569 := Why would you take a gift as glorious as the Force and squander it? Weaken yourself deliberately and shackle yourself to outdated mores?
13570 := Our gift has made us superior. It is our rightful place to rule. How can any deny that? Yet the Jedi do so... and call us 'evil' because we do not.
13571 := Is the sarkath beast who dominates his jungle evil? The tuk'ata who leaps on the squellbug for the kill? These are things of nature, of the universe.
13572 := We are no different from this. The Force is part of the universe, part of the same laws. We were gifted to set us above the rest... to deny nature is foolish.
13573 := We make no apologies for the weak. If you cannot clench your fist and know when the moment comes to strike, there is no place for you amongst us.
13574 := Of those who come to train, those who are weak return home. If they are both weak and foolish, they die... but it was their choice to come.
13575 := You've heard enough, have you? *chuckle* So what is it to be? Are you here to be a Sith or not?
13576 := Oh? That is truly a first. Do as you wish, then, human. I'll not stop you.
13577 := Is there something you need, Jedi? Make it good, for I have little patience.
13578 := You think me a fool? You think I do not recognize robes of the order when I see them?
13579 := You are far from the first Jedi who has come here, after all, willing to abandon that decrepit order of yours.
13580 := You think me a fool? You think I do not recognize a lightsaber when I see it?
13581 := Can you not see that I am busy, human? Ahhh... I see you have a medallion. Where did you get it?
13582 := Do not be insolent, human. I asked you a direct question, and I will not be trifled with. Now... where did you get this medallion?
13583 := [Failure] You think to lie to me, do you? I would suspect you stole this and killed the owner. Very enterprising of you, I must admit.
13584 := We Sith do encourage such independent thinking. You may even be a suitable candidate to join us. That is what you wish, I take it? To become a Sith?
13585 := [Success] Oh? Very well. You do seem a fit candidate, though there is... something odd about you I cannot place...
13586 := [Success] Oh? By one of the others, no doubt. You do seem a fit candidate for the academy, though there is... something odd about you...
13587 := I see. How very enterprising of you, though that is not the normal way that we select our students for the academy.
13588 := You again? What do you wish, now?
13589 := So I see. How curious that you should come to possess such a thing. Where did you get it?
13590 := So one of the others accepted you, even after I did not? You are lucky, human, for I am in a forgiving mood.
13591 := But I have already told you your answer, human. Do not bother me further, or I shall become irritated.
13592 := So I see, from the medallion you carry. How curious that you possess one. Where did you get it?
13593 := You have come back. Good. Are you prepared to go to the academy?
13594 := Then come back when you are ready. But do not take long... I *will* leave without you.
13595 := Then let us leave. The Master of the Academy awaits you.
13596 := I'll be on my way.
13597 := Can I ask you some questions?
13598 := Are you Yuthura Ban?
13599 := Who are you?
13600 := Yes, that's exactly why I'm here. Let me join you.
13601 := I have forgotten most of my training, it seems.
13602 := What difference does it make?
13603 := [Persuade] Yes, it does. I wish to become a Sith.
13604 := [Persuade/Lie] Yes, it does. I wish to become a Sith.
13605 := They are slaves. Don't worry about them.
13606 := [Persuade/Lie] Yes, it does. I wish to become a Sith.
13607 := [Force Persuade] Yes. You want to accept me into the academy.
13608 := No. It doesn't.
13609 := Again? I suppose that would interest me, yes.
13610 := Yes, it does. I wish to become a Sith.
13611 := [Lie] Yes, it does. I wish to become a Sith.
13612 := Yes. I'm a fallen Jedi, if you must know.
13613 := Yes, but only very little.
13614 := No, I don't know what you're talking about.
13615 := No! I would never join the Sith!
13616 := Maybe. I haven't given it much thought.
13617 := Why would I want to join the Sith?
13618 := And what if I said I was already a Sith?
13619 := What about Darth Revan?
13620 := And where does Darth Malak fit into all this?
13621 := You kill each other?
13622 := But you serve the dark side of the Force, don't you?
13623 := But the dark side is evil, it corrupts...
13624 := And what about the Jedi?
13625 := You don't consider yourself evil?
13626 := A lot of the hopefuls here end up dead. That doesn't seem glorious.
13627 := I see. About joining you...
13628 := Never mind... I have to go.
13629 := Yes. I want to join the Sith.
13630 := No, I'm not interested.
13631 := Why did you call me Jedi?
13632 := Why do you want to know?
13633 := [Persuade/Lie] One of the other Sith accepted me into the academy.
13634 := [Persuade/Lie] It was given to me...
13635 := Err... I took it from another student, actually.
13636 := Never mind. I'll go.
13637 := I have this medallion...
13638 := I want to join the Sith.
13639 := I would like to know who you are.
13640 := Not yet.
13641 := Yes, I am.

13752 := You are neither a Sith nor do you bear the medallion of a student of this facility. Please leave at once.
13753 := On your way, citizen.
13754 := [Failure] I have been conditioned to resist mental persuasion, citizen. Please do not attempt that again.
13755 := [Failure] No-one gets inside, citizen. Messages and deliveries must be relayed through official Sith channels only.
13756 := It is the device given to one who has been accepted into the academy, but has not yet proved their worth as a student.
13757 := If one of the Sith decides you are worthy, you will be given one... which you must then take to Yuthura Ban, who I believe is in the cantina. It is she who decides which hopefuls enter the academy.
13758 := You must be admitted to the academy. That decision must be made by a Sith who has already been accepted, here.
13759 := The final decision, however, remains with Master Yuthura. I believe she is currently at the cantina if you wish to seek her out. Now go.
13760 := Greetings, student. I see you have the medallion that marks you as one of the chosen.
13761 := I do not recognize you, however. Have you been accepted into the academy very recently?
13762 := I see. And who might your friends be?
13763 := So long as the Sith do not object to them, neither will I. They will be your responsibility, of course.
13764 := You will want to bring your medallion to Yuthura Ban. She is the one who brings all selected students into the academy for their training.
13765 := I believe she can be located within the cantina here in the colony. I suggest you go to her while she is still there, student.
13766 := Commentary: And if the Sith do object to us, master, I shall fill them full of new holes!
13767 := Aren't we always?
13768 := Ah. I trust you will be responsible for ensuring your slaves are not disruptive, then?
13769 := Commentary: Disruptive? What does he mean by that? I have never been disruptive, master.
13770 := Beep! Beep! Boooop!
13771 := Well, besides *that*.
13772 := Hmph. Suddenly I'm a convincing slave, am I? Maybe you should have left me on the ship.
13773 := I always think we should leave you on the ship, old man.
13774 := Don't get smart-mouthed with me, young man. You're not too old to put over my knee.
13775 := Grrr... I will not play the part of slave for long. Not even to pass this fool.
13776 := If your animal acts up he will be destroyed. This would reflect badly on you, understand?
13777 := No more disruptive than our 'master' will be.
13778 := What was that?
13779 := Oh, nothing.
13780 := Ahh... ignore him, sir. He is mentally deficient. And he drools.
13781 := Hey!
13782 := You again? I told you to locate Yuthura Ban in the cantina. She is the only one who can bring new students into the academy.
13783 := You are a student at the academy. You may enter by the door.
13784 := I'll be going.
13785 := [Force Persuade] You will let me inside.
13786 := [Persuade] I need to get inside. I have been sent to speak with the Master of the Academy!
13787 := What's this medallion you mention?
13788 := How do I become a Sith, then?
13789 := No. I have been away for a while.
13790 := That's none of your business, soldier.
13791 := Yes. Today, in fact.
13792 := They are none of your business.
13793 := They are my slaves.
13794 := Leave me be. Can't you see that I'm busy?
13795 := Good. I don't want to miss this for anything, heh...
13796 := No you may not. I'm busy amusing myself and I'm not going to miss any of the fun. Now get lost before I teach you a lesson.
13797 := Isn't that obvious? You must be very sharp to possess such an astute sense of perception. Obviously deaf, however, since I asked you to leave.
13798 := Is there something specific you wanted?
13799 := Then I trust you'll leave. I think another one of these fools is about to drop, and I don't want to miss it.
13800 := And what if I am?
13801 := That is the whole point! Personally, I think it's wonderful fun... those fools actually think that if they stand there long enough, I'll let them become a Sith.
13802 := Idiots. A Sith is not a bantha, all endurance and no brains. A Sith would fight for his life, no matter the odds. If these rotgrubs are as stupid as they seem, then they deserve their fate!
13803 := Oh, it is. I wonder which one will be the last standing? Should I tell him then that his hopes are in vain, do you think?
13804 := Perhaps, but where does it say I should be merciful? There'd be no sport in it, anyhow. I want to see if they are really as foolish as I suspected.
13805 := *You* demand? Why would I listen to you? I'll do as I please, and if watching these fools starve themselves amuses me, that's what I'll do.
13806 := Oh, it's a test all right. It's a test to see if they're actually fool enough to die. If they don't, however, I certainly wouldn't admit them just for that accomplishment.
13807 := Hmm. It is a bit boring standing out here all day, however. I think I'll go for some dinner... it will be fun to think of them while I gorge myself.
13808 := They'll still be here in an hour or two, surely. I suggest you run along before I decide to make you part of the fun.
13809 := Why not just shoot them where they stand? It would at least be more direct.
13810 := Observation: Yes, very efficient. It is what I would do.
13811 := That's what I would do.
13812 := Of course that's what *you* would do.
13813 := He victimizes them, but they are trying to join his vile kind. I'm not sure I would save them.
13814 := Oh, what a sweet guy. He should get the Sith congeniality medal.
13815 := You should not toy with people's lives!
13816 := Disgusting and barbaric. That these men chose to do this willingly astounds me to no end.
13817 := Well, you should know better than anyone what some people will do for power, Bastila.
13818 := And what is that supposed to mean?
13819 := Well, just that the dark side is quite tempting... or so you always say. What did you think I meant?
13820 := Never mind what I thought. Just be quiet.
13821 := Fine, I'll leave you alone.
13822 := Can I ask you some questions?
13823 := Are you one of the Sith from the academy?
13824 := No, not really.
13825 := Are you Mekel?
13826 := Nothing. Never mind.
13827 := Why are you making those men stand there?
13828 := You have to do something about those men! They're dying!
13829 := Sounds like fun.
13830 := Wouldn't it be more merciful just to kill them?
13831 := Then I demand you stop this at once!
13832 := So this isn't a real test for them?
13833 := I have to stand at attention. P-please... don't distract me, whoever you are.
13834 := Th-thank you... wish me luck.
13835 := N-no... no, I'm not. I'd like nothing better, however. Th-that's... that's why I'm here.
13836 := I... I'm trying to prove my worth to enter the Sith academy, here. We were told that if we stood here long enough... we would be worthy.
13837 := We've been here... for so many days. I'm so hungry! Some... some of us have died. But I must be strong, I must! I will keep standing!
13838 := I... n-no, please, put it away! I... I can't accept any, Mekel said. He's the Sith... over there, watching us...
13839 := I must be strong! Mekel... will find me worthy... soon, I hope...
13840 := N-no, I can't! I must get into the academy! Mekel is the Sith, over there, watching us... he told us we have to do this!
13841 := Mekel. H-he's the Sith... the one watching us from over there! He... h-he said this was how we would prove our worth...
13842 := Seems like not much to do to be worthy of anything. How long you been up to it, boy?
13843 := That's madness! How long have you been here?
13844 := You... you were talking to Mekel! I saw you! Where did he go? D-did he... did he tell you I was worthy?!
13845 := I... suppose he'll come back. Well, then, I'll just have to wait!
13846 := [Failure] You... must think I am a great f-fool! Go away! I will get in, I will!
13847 := [Success] He... he did? The guard at the door? My final test? At last!
13848 := I... I'll do it! I'll prove my strength! AAAAAAHHHH!!
13849 := Should I feel bad for him? I don't.
13850 := One really has to wonder if all Sith start off this gullible.
13851 := Observation: Marvelous elimination of the enemy, master! I applaud you!
13852 := You should not manipulate people this way! You may fall!
13853 := What are you doing? This man is not even a Sith, in truth. This is beneath contempt.
13854 := [Failure] Hah! L-like... like I would believe that! You... are just trying to make me leave! I will get in, I will!
13855 := [Success] N-no! Not after all this time! I... oh, this is terrible! I'll have to... go home...
13856 := Mother will be so angry! Ooohh...
13857 := I don't know if any of these fools deserve second chances.
13858 := Hmm. Did you save the boy or just crush his dreams? I wonder...
13859 := That was the right thing to do - turn him away from the Sith.
13860 := That was a kind thing to do. Better he give up on the Sith while he can.
13861 := Somehow I think he'll get over it.
13862 := [Failure] You're wrong! I... must wait here to be worthy; you are... just trying to trick me so you will be chosen!
13863 := Go now, and t-tempt me no more! I... will be strong!
13864 := [Success] What?! I... I've wasted all this time! How could I have been so... foolish! I could have died!
13865 := I'll find another way in, I swear it! I'll show him! Thank you!
13866 := Just leave me alone. I have to get in the academy!
13867 := Fine, I'll leave you to it.
13868 := Are you one of the Sith?
13869 := What are you doing?
13870 := Here, I have a bit of food...
13871 := Are you crazy? You have to stop!
13872 := Who put you up to this?
13873 := No. I'll be going.
13874 := [Persuade/Lie] Not yet. He said your final test is to attack that guard.
13875 := [Persuade/Lie] He said you should go home. The Sith aren't for you.
13876 := [Persuade] Mekel is tricking you. He'll never let you into the academy.
13877 := But I - 
13878 := You'll get your... turn soon enough, fool. And when you do, *Cough* I will be there, laughing as you collapse from... heat exhaustion and Mekel's beatings!
13879 := Leave... leave me be! I won't listen to your... manipulations. I... I *will* make it into the academy!
13880 := Just... just a few hours longer... just a few hours, surely...
13881 := You... you have a medallion! How... how did you... unghhhh...
13882 := I... I must g-get into... the academy... must...
13883 := P-please... don't hurt me... I am too weak with hunger...
13884 := You... talked to Mekel? Have I proved my worth? Did he say anything...?
13885 := No, p-please... I... I cannot...
13886 := [Failure] I... don't believe you! You just want to... be chosen! But... it will be me! It will be... me...
13887 := [Success] Go... home...? I...
13888 := [Failure] N-no! That can't be... you're wrong! I... can't have wasted my life...
13889 := [Success] Oh... oh. All this... for nothing...
13890 := No. I'll be going.
13891 := [Persuade/Lie] He said you should go home. The Sith aren't for you.
13892 := [Persuade] Mekel is tricking you. He'll never let you into the academy.

13928 := You should really talk to Thalia. We'll... go wherever she does.
13929 := You came back again? Why?! I told you we're not going back to the academy, so go away!!
13930 := Hold it right there, whoever you are! We... we're not going back to the academy! We'll kill you rather than go back!
13931 := Then get out of here! Now! Or we'll open fire!!
13932 := Open fire! Get them! Get them!!
13933 := You mean you aren't here to kill us or bring us back? I find that hard to believe. The only way into these caves is through the academy. You must be a Sith.
13934 := So what is it, then? If you're not here to kill us or bring us back, why are you here? Speak up!
13935 := So you have heard about us. Yes, we ran away before Master Uthar could execute us. Is that so hard to believe?
13936 := So you don't know about us? I don't know if I'm ready to believe that or not, but I'll play along for the moment.
13937 := My name is Thalia May. The others here and myself refused to murder a bunch of people on a whim from Master Uthar... so here we are.
13938 := We thought that becoming a Sith was what we always wanted, but that wasn't true. Now all we want is to get out of here. Fair enough?
13939 := Help us? Why should I believe that this isn't some kind of trick?
13940 := [Failure] No! I know what Sith like you want from us! You're not bringing our heads to Master Uthar so he can pat you on the back!
13941 := They're here to kill us! Get them!! Get them!!
13942 := [Success] You want to help us? Alright... I can think of a way. We're stuck in these caves, obviously, or we would have been long gone.
13943 := There's a passage to the surface through the caves, but we're blocked by some kind of large creature. We can't defeat it.
13944 := If you could kill it and clear up the passageway for us, we could escape. That would be help enough. Can you do that?
13945 := I figured as much. Get out of here, then. Go on! We have enough to worry about with the shyrack!
13946 := I'll believe that when I see it... but if you could, we would be... grateful.
13947 := [Success] You want to help us? Alright... I can think of a way. We're stuck in these caves, obviously, or we would have been long gone.
13948 := So... is there news? Is the passageway clear?
13949 := It... it's clear? We can go?
13950 := Thank you. This... I wasn't expecting help from anyone in the academy. I guess we aren't the only ones who don't... agree with everything.
13951 := Maybe... maybe the Jedi will accept us. I've seen how evil the dark side is. Maybe I could try.
13952 := At any rate, thank you again. You've saved our lives.
13953 := Alright. We'll keep waiting, then. Watch out for that beast... it's dangerous.
13954 := You... you tricked us! You just wanted to get closer!! Quick, get them!!
13955 := Alright, I'll leave you be.
13956 := I guess we'll do this the hard way, then.
13957 := I'm not here to bring you back.
13958 := Go back? What are you talking about?
13959 := You're... the renegade students? The ones who ran away?
13960 := Slow down and tell me what you're doing here.
13961 := Fair enough. I'll leave you be.
13962 := Sorry. Time for you to die.
13963 := Maybe I can help you.
13964 := Fine. You've worn out my patience. Time to die.
13965 := [Persuade] Give me a chance and I'll prove it to you.
13966 := The passage is already clear.
13967 := Forget it. Get yourselves out.
13968 := I can try.
13969 := Okay, you got me. I'm here to kill you after all.
13970 := It's clear. You're free to go.
13971 := Not yet, but I'm working on it.

14018 := Dustil... what? What are you talking about? I... I thought you were dead!
14019 := Too bad you didn't still think that. Or did you really think I would be happy to see you?
14020 := Look, everyone! It's Father, come to rescue me at long last! Sure, he may have left Mother and I to die on Telos, but that doesn't matter!
14021 := No, I didn't abandon you! The task force just arrived too late. Telos was in ruins, and your mother... I held her while...
14022 := But I looked for you. I swear I looked everywhere --
14023 := Ah, save it. You abandoned us long before. We were alone all during the wars, and even once you came back, you still didn't stay.
14024 := I didn't have a choice! I was needed...
14025 := Yeah? Well you were needed at home, too. You were needed when the bombing started and I got captured.
14026 := You know what? It doesn't matter. Not any more. I have a new family now, a family that cares about me. I don't need you.
14027 := The Sith? You can't mean that! No, the Sith killed your mother! The Sith destroyed Telos!
14028 := So? You're the soldier, father. How many mothers have you killed?
14029 := No, you've been brainwashed. The son I knew would never --
14030 := You never knew me. You weren't even there to know me, so don't presume to tell me what I would or wouldn't do!
14031 := I don't know what's been done to you, but you're coming with me out of here. Now.
14032 := Touch me, old man, and I'll kill you. Get out! Get out of here before I tell the Sith that you're here!
14033 := No! I won't accept that! I won't give up on him!!
14034 := Why not? You gave up on Mother and I a long time ago. We were just an afterthought next to your glory-hunting!
14035 := Stop it, Dustil! Stop it! I won't let you go on like this! What have they done to you?!
14036 := They gave me a life, old man. They gave me power! You... you didn't even give me so much as a second's notice.
14037 := No... no, that's not true! I was there when you were younger, but I had to leave to fight! I fought for *you*, for your freedom!
14038 := No you didn't. You fought for yourself. For glory. Well, the Sith can do that, too. We learn to fight... and to kill. You want to see what I've learned, 'father'?
14039 := No, Dustil, don't! I don't --
14040 := Too late, old man! You should have left when you had the chance!!
14041 := Yeah, I can just imagine what you two are up to, here. Master Uthar will be more than happy to hear about it, I'm sure.
14042 := Shut up! Stay out of this!
14043 := Is that all you do? Give out orders? Well you can't show up after all this time and expect to give me orders! I'm not your soldier and I'm sure as hell not your son!
14044 := I don't need his protection! Not anymore. The Sith give me everything I need.
14045 := You can't mean that! The Sith are... they're evil. They're the dark side. They... they took me away from you and your mother. They're... they're what took you from me!
14046 := No, they're not evil! They're not! The dark side is superior, and you... you were at war long before they came along!
14047 := The Sith war to conquer, to rule the helpless. I went to war for *you*, Dustil. For your freedom, your future!
14048 := Heh. I... don't believe you.
14049 := If I failed you, son, then it's... it's *my* failure. Please don't add to it by becoming part of something evil.
14050 := Prove it. Prove that the Sith are so evil and I'll... I'll think about it.
14051 := I... wish I could help you, son. I truly do.
14052 := Right. Just as I thought. You can't prove anything.
14053 := You're going to have to fight your own battles, Dustil. I've...I've fought all I can for you.
14054 := I'll stay right here. I won't tell anyone you're here... for now. You find some 'proof' and you bring it to me.
14055 := If I hear you asking questions about me or doing a single thing to jeopardize my position in the Sith, I swear I'll tell everyone what you're up to.
14056 := You got that, father? You prove what you're saying is true. I'm not going anywhere, otherwise.
14057 := I... got it, Dustil. I'll be back. I swear it.
14058 := I'm not going to follow you around, forget it. If you're caught, they'll just think I was betraying them.
14059 := You take a wrong turn somewhere?
14060 := Well, don't let me keep you.
14061 := As if I'm not busy enough with my own work? Go pester someone else with your stupid questions.
14062 := Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings? Why don't you run to Master Uthar and tell him all about it. I'm sure he'll be very sympathetic.
14063 := You know what I want? I want for you to run along and do whatever it is you're supposed to be doing. I'm too busy to deal with morons.
14064 := The name's Dustil. That satisfy your curiosity enough?
14065 := So you know my last name, so what?
14066 := What is with the questions? My life is none of your business, so get lost.
14067 := No, I'm not. I don't know who you're talking about.
14068 := Look... I don't want to hear that name ever again. Ever. You understanding me? Now get lost.
14069 := Back already? So tell me, father, where's this 'proof' you promised?
14070 := I don't have anything. Yet. But I haven't given up on you, Dustil.
14071 := Yeah, well, that's a surprise. I gave up on you a long time ago. So did Mother, for that fact.
14072 := Please... don't say that...
14073 := Whatever. Just go if you're going. I have things to do.
14074 := I have a datapad I want you to look at. You knew someone named Selene?
14075 := Selene? She's the one who convinced me to come to the academy with her. Why? Where did you get this?
14076 := Look at it. It belongs to Master Uthar, doesn't it?
14077 := Yes... it's his. But... he told me... he, he said that she'd been lost on a mission in the valley. This... this says that they...
14078 := Killed her because she was hindering your progress. Superiority at any cost, Dustil. There's your evil. Or can you live with that?
14079 := No. No, I can't. I... I had no idea... they lied to me.
14080 := Well, there's the son I remember. Now will you leave here?
14081 := I... no. You go do whatever you have to, father. I... I have some other friends here. I have to warn them what's going on.
14082 := And maybe I can, you know, look around here and find out some more information. From the inside. Something that might help you.
14083 := I... don't suppose there's any way I could talk you out of that, is there? I mean, you're not going to do anything half way. Sounds familiar.
14084 := Maybe... after this is over, we can... talk. I'm still not sure about... us, but I'll listen. Maybe we can get back to where we should have been.
14085 := I'd like that.
14086 := I don't see the old man with you. Did he come to his senses and leave, finally? I knew he couldn't prove anything.
14087 := I don't know why you're still here. Why don't you just follow him wherever he went? You and I have no business at all.
14088 := Let's go, Carth. This is no use.
14089 := You don't want to do that, Dustil. Trust me.
14090 := Looks like your boy is all grown up, Carth.
14091 := Calm down, Dustil. Carth is only trying to protect you.
14092 := How about this notepad? Did you know someone named Selene?
14093 := This is pointless, Carth. He'll never believe us.
14094 := How can we prove something like that?
14095 := Come with us, then, and we'll show you.
14096 := I have to go.
14097 := Can I ask you some questions?
14098 := There's no need to act like that.
14099 := You want to make an issue out of it?
14100 := Who are you?
14101 := Dustil? As in Dustil Onasi?
14102 := How did you end up at the academy?
14103 := Aren't you Carth Onasi's son?
14104 := Are you sure...?
14105 := Greetings, student.
14106 := If you wish. Good luck with your training.
14107 := May the Force serve you well.
14108 := You are one of the hopefuls who look to gain prestige, yes? I am afraid there is little that I could help you with.
14109 := I am sure you would prefer to speak to one of the students, here, or perhaps the trainers.
14110 := I am sure there is nothing I can help you with. I am only a servant to the academy.
14111 := My name is Adrenas. I am the chamberlain of the academy... generally I look after maintenance and supply, here.
14112 := No, not truly. I serve the Sith, but I do not study and train in the Force as you do.
14113 := He did? Allow me to see that for a moment...
14114 := Ah, yes, I see. I will do as Master Uthar requests, of course. Thank you for bringing this to me.
14115 := I have to go.
14116 := Can I ask you some questions?
14117 := Who are you?
14118 := So you aren't a Sith?
14119 := Master Uthar gave me this datapad for you.
14120 := You! I remember you!
14121 := What are you doing here?! Did the Jedi Council send you? I swear I will expose you if they have!
14122 := But you will! You pretend to be a Sith, but I know who you are! I have cursed your name every moment since we last met on Dantooine!
14123 := I am Belaya, once of the Jedi but now of the Sith... it was your murder of Juhani that placed this bitter blackness in my heart! 
14124 := I couldn't touch you on Dantooine, but I can, here! The Sith have taught me the power of freedom... and revenge! FOR JUHANI!!
14125 := [Failure] You do not fool me for a second! The Council fawns over you and places all their hope in you to save them... you wouldn't turn on them!
14126 := You are a spy... and a murderer. It was you who killed Juhani and placed this bitter blackness in my heart that I cannot get rid of!
14127 := [Success] I see. So you have come to join the Sith as I have? I should have known that would happen, as should the Council.
14128 := The Council is nothing but a slow and doddering farce, placing all their trust in you... and you failed them, just as you failed Juhani.
14129 := Do you even remember me? I am Belaya, and it is your murder of Juhani that brought me here. Fortunately, I have learned the power of revenge!
14130 := So you do not even have the decency to remember me? I have cursed your name every moment since we last met on Dantooine.
14131 := I'll not suffer your insults!
14132 := [Persuade] No, the Jedi certainly didn't send me here.
14133 := Err... do I know you?
14134 := That datapad... take a look at it. I wonder if Dustil knows his friend was disposed of like that?
14135 := If not, it might convince Dustil that what we're saying about the Sith is true. It would be worth a shot.
14136 := I'm sorry, Dustil. I did all I could, and I... failed you.

14149 := Oh, hello again. You're, uh... doing well in your training?
14150 := Please don't tell anyone what I told you. They would tell me to leave... or worse.
14151 := Oh, ah... hello. I don't remember seeing you here before. My name is Kel... Kel Algwinn.
14152 := Err... well, good luck with your training.
14153 := Of course. It's full of ancient Sith ruins, from a time before the Sith left this region of space. Rather exciting, really. I've, uh, never studied it myself... I couldn't help you much.
14154 := If you're really interested, there's a fellow by the name of Dak who's out in the valley now. He knows plenty about it.
14155 := Yes, of course. I must admit I've never really understood it very well. Enough to please Master Uthar, I guess... but I still have trouble with it.
14156 := Don't say that! Leave me alone, or you'll be sorry!
14157 := Just leave!
14158 := I am a Sith, better trained than you! I'll show you!!
14159 := Yeah. Yes, I suppose so. Thanks.
14160 := I... oh, uh, nothing.
14161 := Y-yes. My master always says I am too trusting, too willing to show weakness. You're a Sith, so I really shouldn't... you know...
14162 := Uh, n-no, I really can't. A Sith... like you... would use any means to succeed.
14163 := Well I... I... I didn't mean it like that.
14164 := I... I shouldn't trust you. I can't trust you, can I?
14165 := I, uh, I suppose you're right. Never mind. Forget I said anything.
14166 := I... forget I said anything. Just... go back to your training, please. I have work to do.
14167 := I... I am too a Sith! I'm more a Sith than you are! I'll show you!!
14168 := [Success] I just... don't feel I belong here. I thought maybe I did at first, but now I... I don't know. I have so many doubts.
14169 := [Success] I just... don't feel I belong here. I thought maybe I did at first, but now... I don't know. I have so many doubts.
14170 := [Failure] No... no, I shouldn't bother you with it. Forget I said anything.
14171 := [Success] I just... don't feel I belong here. I thought maybe I did at first, but now... I don't know. I just have so many doubts.
14172 := Yes, I'm... I'm sorry. P-please don't, don't tell anyone... I'll get over it, I guess.
14173 := I guess you're right. The dark side is... where I belong. No going back now. Th-thank you.
14174 := But where would I go, then? What would I do?
14175 := Uh, eh, maybe you're right. *sigh* I'll go and... tell Master Uthar that I'm not ready for this. Maybe it won't be so bad. Th-thank you.
14176 := I... don't know. I never really thought about it. Maybe I should seek it out, give it a try. Thank you... thank you so much!
14177 := Oh, I know that. I mean... you aren't yet, but you intend to be. I mean you're just like everyone else here.
14178 := This one isn't raving like the others. A doubter.
14179 := Have you heard? Master Uthar is dead and Yuthura Ban has taken over the academy. How brutal...
14180 := Have you heard? Yuthura Ban is dead. I hear Master Uthar is looking for a new apprentice. How awful...
14181 := Isn't it strange? Nobody seems to know what happened to Master Uthar or Yuthura. They're both just... gone.
14182 := I'll be going.
14183 := Do you know anything about the excavations in the valley?
14184 := Do you know anything about the Code of the Sith?
14185 := And you're a full Sith? How pathetic.
14186 := Fine, fine. Have it your way.
14187 := I doubt that.
14188 := All things take time. Not to worry.
14189 := What's the problem?
14190 := Is something wrong?
14191 := Alright. Suit yourself.
14192 := Are you sure?
14193 := I can't persuade you to tell me?
14194 := Are you saying you're not a Sith?
14195 := Well, how did you mean it, then?
14196 := No, of course not. What kind of Sith are you?
14197 := Out with it. This is getting tiresome.
14198 := You're no Sith. I've never seen anyone so pathetic!
14199 := [Force Persuade] You want to trust me.
14200 := [Persuade] Sure you can.
14201 := [Persuade] Sure you can.
14202 := Is that it? Don't bother me with your petty weaknesses.
14203 := Everyone has doubts. Keep it up... you'll come around.
14204 := If it doesn't feel right, then perhaps you don't belong here.
14205 := Leave, obviously. You're not ready to be a Sith. You'll wind up dead.
14206 := It doesn't matter. Have you considered that the dark side just isn't your way?
14207 := Have you thought about the Jedi?
14208 := Master Uthar probably wouldn't like to hear that.
14209 := But I'm not a Sith, yet.
14210 := And you're not?
14211 := I remember you from the colony. You seem alright, though you'll not win the right to train before me.
14212 := I'll get more prestige and catch up to you. Count on it.
14213 := Mmm. Don't trip or kill yourself or anything.
14214 := Do run along... you have a long way to catch up, after all.
14215 := You? I remember you from the colony. I can't believe you actually made it into the academy.
14216 := A duel? Fine, you run along and get ready while I go gain some prestige. Idiot.
14217 := Just figured that out, did you? It just so happens that I have a sure-fire way of pulling ahead in this little contest of ours. You don't really have a chance.
14218 := You may have more prestige than me, but that won't last long, just you wait and see.
14219 := Uh-huh. Well, you may be the competition, but I've still got the edge on you.
14220 := And what do you have to brag about? You haven't earned any prestige at all. 
14221 := Hmph. I suppose I *could* use some help. The artifact I know of certainly won't be easy to take. But why should I work with you?
14222 := [Success] Flattery, is it? I... suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...
14223 := [Failure] Hmmm... no. No, it's not worth it. I'll figure out how to get the artifact, myself.
14224 := So run along and get your own prestige, will you? Thanks ever so much.
14225 := [Success] Hmmm. You make a decent case. I suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...
14226 := I want something out of this, first, however. I want you to tell me about some lead you have for where I could find more prestige.
14227 := Then you're on your own.
14228 := Then you'll just have to come back when you do. Of course, I may have changed my mind by then...
14229 := He's... one of the students? Yes, I've met the sniveler. I think I know where you're going with this... good, yes, I accept.
14230 := I think I have heard of that. But it's good enough... at least I know you're telling the truth.
14231 := Oh? I hadn't heard about them. It certainly merits looking into.
14232 := I thought that was a myth. Perhaps you are correct, however... it may be worth prestige to investigate.
14233 := [Failure] How gullible to you believe me to be? The furthest tomb? Yeah right. Find your own prestige.
14234 := [Success] Oh? I hadn't heard about that. Fair enough... I will have to look into it.
14235 := You've given me a lead, so I'll let you in on my plan. The artifact that I've discovered is an ancient Jedi holocron.
14236 := Unfortunately, the holocron lies in the gullet of a tuk'ata mother. I can arrange for us to 'meet' her, but you're going to have to help me in putting her down.
14237 := That make sense to you? Go into the valley when you're prepared enough. I'll be amongst the central pillars, near the north end.
14238 := Remember: the central pillars in the valley. I'll be waiting, so don't take too long.
14239 := A holocron... this holocron, anyway... is an ancient recording device. It can store and display large amounts of information.
14240 := Because it probably contains secrets from the time when the Sith ruins on this planet first existed. You don't think that Master Uthar would find that impressive?
14241 := And I'm just supposed to trust *you*? You're the one who asked to work on this, remember?
14242 := You watch me and I'll watch you. I don't trust you any more than you trust me. If you don't like that, don't come.
14243 := [Failure] Forget it. I never liked you to begin with, and I'm not about to work with you.
14244 := [Success] Hmmm. You make a decent case. I suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...
14245 := [Failure] Trying to force me to agree with you, hey? Don't make me laugh. You want my cooperation, you'll have to get it the old-fashioned way.
14246 := [Success] Yes, I do... want to work with you. I suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...
14247 := I've found an artifact that will impress Uthar far more than anything you could ever scrounge up. I'll win for sure.
14248 := Fine by me.
14249 := I don't have it just yet. I'll get it... when I'm good and ready.
14250 := So what if it is? I'll get it eventually, regardless. Nothing good comes without a bit of a fight... that's the Sith motto, more or less.
14251 := You go ahead and think that. I'll enjoy the look on your face when I win.
14252 := [Failure] Hah! Forget it. I'm not going to be tricked so easily. Just move along, now.
14253 := [Success] Help me get it? I don't know...
14254 := This is not wise. She'll be as willing to lie as you are.
14255 := Yeah, but if we do it first, we win. Shush up, Big Z.
14256 := What? Sith don't co-operate on things like this...
14257 := Quiet, already!
14258 := Don't you shush me, Carth Onasi!
14259 := Keep it up and I'll gag you. Are you forgetting where we are? Now be quiet.
14260 := Now where are you going with this, I wonder?
14261 := Shut up, old man, and don't spoil anything or I'll twist that scrawny neck of yours.
14262 := It was just an idle question. Don't get so testy, damn it.
14263 := Hah! Like I would tell you. Why don't I just let you rob me while you're at it?
14264 := You don't remember? My name is Lashowe. We met in the colony, ever so briefly.
14265 := My name is Lashowe. Remember it, for I'll be the one who earns the prestige to move on. You'll have to be satisfied with next year, I suppose.
14266 := You are such a fool. I cannot believe that you were gullible enough to allow me to return with the holocron. I gained considerable prestige for it, you know.
14267 := Ha ha ha! Look... either do something about it or run along, will you? I have prestige to earn.
14268 := So? That's your problem, not mine.
14269 := You're joking, of course. You want to fight me here? In the academy?
14270 := I thought not. Get lost, then, will you? I'm busy.
14271 := Ha ha ha! Oh, I wonder what Master Uthar will think of this! Alright, then... you have yourself a fight!
14272 := Commentary: I like the sound of this! Warming up blasters... on your command, master!
14273 := You beat me. Go on, gloat, I could care less. I'll succeed next time.
14274 := I understand that Yuthura is dead. Good... perhaps I will be Master Uthar's next apprentice! How glorious that would be!
14275 := I must go.
14276 := I challenge you to a duel.
14277 := I have to go.
14278 := I remember you. I challenge you to a duel!
14279 := You're trying to become a Sith as well?
14280 := You talk big, but that's about it.
14281 := Perhaps we could work together?
14282 := [Persuade] I've always wanted to work with a beautiful woman.
14283 := [Persuade] Because together we will be unbeatable.
14284 := Forget it! I'm not giving you any leads!
14285 := But I don't know any leads...
14286 := Hmm. You could go and talk to Kel Algwinn.
14287 := I've heard there's an artifact sword in the tomb of Freedon Nadd.
14288 := There are some renegades hiding on the surface which Master Uthar wants killed.
14289 := Do you know about the hermit in the hills that kidnaps students?
14290 := [Lie] There is a powerful Sith cloak in the furthest tomb in the valley.
14291 := See you there.
14292 := What is a holocron?
14293 := Why do you think this holocron is so important?
14294 := And I'm just supposed to trust you?
14295 := [Persuade] Because together we will be unbeatable.
14296 := [Force Persuade] Because you want to work with me.
14297 := And what way is that?
14298 := Fine, forget it.
14299 := Why haven't you brought it to Uthar yet?
14300 := It's guarded, isn't it?
14301 := You're lying. You don't have anything.
14302 := [Lie] Maybe I could help you get it?
14303 := [Persuade/Lie] Maybe I could help you get it?
14304 := Where is this artifact?
14305 := [Persuade] I'd like to help you retrieve your artifact.
14306 := Who are you?
14307 := Fine. I'll go, now.
14308 := You betrayed me, you traitorous...!
14309 := But I helped you get the holocron!
14310 := You won't get away with this! I'll kill you!
14311 := I suppose not.
14312 := That's right!
14313 := [The door is locked but may be opened by other means.]
14314 := You hanging around, still? Don't you have your own plans? Not that they'll help you... I'm in for sure, you know.
14315 := It's a bad year to try and become a Sith, you know... I've got it all wrapped up.
14316 := Go ahead: gloat. I'll catch up to you, yet.
14317 := You've got some prestige already. Relax, why don't you?
14318 := Yes, I imagine you've got some scurrying around to do, don't you?
14319 := Maybe. You're not doing too bad, I suppose. I know something you don't, though.
14320 := Well, you're off to a super start. You've got no more prestige than I do, at the moment. Thing is: I know how to get some.
14321 := Think what you like. Just remember: only one of us gets to become a Sith.
14322 := Uhhh... no. Nobody here will tell you anything about that. I've got a better plan, though.
14323 := You think I would tell you? Have my brains started dribbling out of my nose, or something?
14324 := Yeah... so I see. I'll be keeping my eye on you.
14325 := Well, you keep working on that.
14326 := There's nothing you know that I could possibly want. Thanks anyhow.
14327 := [Failure] I could, but what would be the point in that? See you around, chump.
14328 := [Success] Hmph. I guess there's no harm in it. Word has it that Master Uthar gives big points for Sith artifacts that are brought back from the valley.
14329 := Well, you're free to go wander out there, if you like. Me, I'll be seeing you later.
14330 := Hmph. Well, if you've known for so long, why haven't you taken advantage of it, yet? Yeah, just like I thought.
14331 := The Valley of the Sith Lords. You know... where the academy does all its excavating. If you really don't know, just go out the east exit and you'll see.
14332 := Funny. Say that after I'm a full Sith and I'll ground your face into the dirt just for fun.
14333 := That's right. You might as well just go home, you know. There can only be one Sith this year, and that's me.
14334 := The name's Mekel. I'm one of the hopefuls up for Sith-hood, just like you. Well, I'm the one that's going to make it, that is.
14335 := Alright, fine, you won. Big deal.
14336 := You spared me. I don't know why you did it... maybe you aren't even a real Sith. Either that or you're a far better one than me.
14337 := At any rate, where I come from folks honor their debts. I won't oppose you in the contest. If getting into the academy's what you want, go right ahead.
14338 := I hear you beat out the others to get the prestige you needed. Congratulations. You deserve it.
14339 := Mekel, right?
14340 := I've got to go.
14341 := Whatever. I'm the one who's going to make it.
14342 := And what's that?
14343 := You're lying. I can tell.
14344 := How do you plan on getting prestige?
14345 := You know the Code of the Sith?
14346 := What makes you so sure?
14347 := I got my own plans.
14348 := Maybe we can trade information?
14349 := [Persuade] You can at least give me a hint.
14350 := Thanks for the tip.
14351 := You just found that out, did you?
14352 := The valley?
14353 := It would be an improvement.
14354 := I remember you. Mekel, right?
14355 := Who are you?
14356 := I'll kill you!!
14357 := I... your kind has killed everyone I know!
14358 := You give me a weapon, Sith... I'm going to use it.
14359 := You want me... to fight you?
14360 := You... you inhuman monster!
14361 := Come and get me, if that's what you want!!
14362 := You... you're going to make me fight, aren't you? Then... then fight I will!!
14363 := What, so you can have sport with me? AAHHHHH!!
14364 := And let you hunt me down? NEVER!!
14365 := Die! Die!!
14366 := I won't be an easy kill for you, Sith!!
14367 := You'll pay for what you've done! AAHHHHH!!
14368 := I'll kill you before you kill me! I swear it!!
14369 := As if I would ever believe that!
14370 := This should be fun!
14371 := Run! I've freed you!
14372 := Wait! I'm not a Sith!
14373 := Go away. There's nothing we need to talk about.
14374 := The Republic will come for me. And when they do, you'll get what's coming to you!
14375 := Please... some food. I'm begging you!
14376 := You can release me or kill me... but don't stand there pretending to be my friend.
14377 := Get lost, Sith. I'm not falling for any of your tricks.
14378 := Sorry, I don't have time to speak. I'm studying the Code.
14379 := I remember you. You're alright. Trying for the academy, I see.
14380 := I know. You and I are equal in prestige, you know. Could be tight.
14381 := You and me both. We're going to have to get some prestige... quick.
14382 := You want to challenge me? To a duel? Heh... I've got a lot more planned than giving someone like you a fair fight.
14383 := I guess we'll meet eventually... on my terms. Good luck until then.
14384 := That's true. I had no idea you were coming for the academy when I met you in the colony, though.
14385 := Oh-ho! If it isn't the freak from the colony. Hello, freak.
14386 := So you got a little prestige. It won't help you... I'll gut you eventually, just you watch.
14387 := Fine by me. I can't wait to gut you, personally... one less competitor to deal with.
14388 := And go into the dueling room? Hah! I've got better things to do than give you a fair fight.
14389 := You can count on seeing me later, though. My lightsaber has your name on it.
14390 := You'll get yours. Just you wait.
14391 := The name's Shaardan. Didn't I tell you that back in the colony? Maybe not.
14392 := I don't work or play well with others. Thanks for the offer, though.
14393 := Shaardan's the name. Don't forget it. You'll have me to thank when you get kicked out of here.
14394 := Hmph. I could've won. You were just lucky.
14395 := What's this I hear about Yuthura Ban being dead? You know something about that?
14396 := Can you believe it? They say that Yuthura took over the academy! Maybe I'll get my chance, yet!
14397 := I have to go.
14398 := I challenge you to a duel!
14399 := So are you, obviously.
14400 := Leave me alone.
14401 := You want to make an issue out of it?
14402 := Get lost, nerf-herder.
14403 := Who are you?
14404 := Do you want to co-ordinate strategy?
14405 := If you're here to use the dueling room, go ahead. I'm through with it, for the moment.
14406 := No problem. Enjoy.
14407 := No thanks. I'm pretty bushed right now. Maybe later.
14408 := Just go to the computer console and open up one of the cages. And don't be wasteful... we only get so many captives a month, you know.
14409 := [Success] But... Master Uthar is missing. There's no way for me to confirm that!
14410 := Hmmm. Something big must be up, indeed. Is the Republic about to attack Korriban?
14411 := Well, you go back to wherever Master Uthar is and tell him I'm on it. I'll get these prisoners out of the academy pronto!
14412 := [Failure] Don't be foolish. If Master Yuthura wants to send an order like that, she can bloody well tell me herself.
14413 := [Success] Hmmm... I knew something was up when Yuthura showed up and claimed control of the academy. Uthar must be planning a fight.
14414 := [Failure] Don't be foolish. If Uthar wants to send an order like that, he can bloody well tell me himself.
14415 := This is where you get to hone your killing styles. We get sent captives all the time to practice on. It's very handy.
14416 := You only get so many before the terminal cuts you off. Some of the students are a little bloodthirsty and get carried away, after all.
14417 := Why? It'd be a waste just to execute them. At least this way they're useful.
14418 := Thanks.
14419 := I challenge you to a duel.
14420 := What do I need to do?
14421 := [Persuade] I have orders from Master Uthar: all the captives are to be released.
14422 := [Persuade] I have orders that all the captives here are to be released.
14423 := [Persuade] All of the captives here need to be released.
14424 := What kind of dueling are you talking about?
14425 := You mean... we can kill any of the prisoners here?
14426 := That's barbaric!
14427 := Still working to earn prestige, are you?
14428 := Greetings. You're one of the new hopefuls, aren't you? I imagine you're eager to garner some prestige for Master Uthar.
14429 := I imagine you've got a lot to do.
14430 := I am adding new entries into our library's database based on the excavations in the valley. Currently I'm working on Ajunta Pall... quite a fascinating subject.
14431 := The very same.
14432 := A little. Some of us believe it may be found in his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords. Whoever found the sword could gain great prestige.
14433 := Isn't that what you're interested in? Although I suppose you could also keep it...
14434 := Well... the legends say the sword had dark power, but that may only be a story. We will never know unless we can examine it more closely.
14435 := You simply need to follow the east passage... there's an exit there which will lead you up to the surface. Look for Tariga... she is in that area and can probably help you.
14436 := Some unsuccessful attempts have been made. I truly don't know why a more concerted effort isn't made, however.
14437 := Ajunta Pall was one of the first of the great Sith Lords... at least, according to the ruins here on Korriban. One of the tombs out in the Valley of the Dark Lords belongs to him.
14438 := He wielded a powerful sword, by all accounts. Some of us believe it might be in that tomb, which is quite exciting.
14439 := According to legend, Ajunta Pall forged a sword imbued with the essence of the dark side. Someone who found it could gain considerable prestige.
14440 := Hmm. That depends. Do you know anything about Ajunta Pall?
14441 := My name is Tamlen. I'm assigned here to the library... mostly keeping it up to date with new discoveries and such.
14442 := Hmm. Is that the sword of Ajunta Pall you have there? Fascinating. If it truly is, you might want to hand that over to Master Uthar, no?
14443 := How do you do? Excuse me... I must return to my studies.
14444 := Congratulations on joining the academy proper. I imagine you'll be taking your final test soon?
14445 := *sigh* Politics are afoot at the academy once again. You'd best be careful... a lot of people 'disappear' at a time like this.
14446 := I've got to be going.
14447 := What are you doing here?
14448 := Ajunta Pall the ancient Sith Lord?
14449 := Do you know anything about his sword?
14450 := Gain prestige?
14451 := What do you know about the sword's powers?
14452 := How do I get to this valley?
14453 := Hasn't any effort been made to recover it?
14454 := Who is Ajunta Pall?
14455 := His sword?
14456 := I am. Anything you can help me with?
14457 := Who are you?
14458 := New discoveries?
14459 := Do not cause trouble for the Sith.
14460 := I serve the Sith.
14461 := Greetings, student.
14462 := You must be accompanied by a Sith Master if you wish admittance into the academy, citizen.
14463 := Sorry, I don't have time to speak. My training awaits.
14464 := Hmm. So you got enough prestige to win out, I hear. We'll just see if you make it through your final test.
14465 := The buzz is that you took care of that crazy droid out in the ruins. That's pretty impressive.
14466 := I was told that you actually met the old master of the academy, Jorak. Is the hermit as mad as they say?
14467 := Rumor around the academy is that you had something to do with those rebel students being caught, finally. They got what they deserved, I say.
14468 := It is my most fervent hope to serve under Darth Malak once my training is complete. Don't you feel the same?
14469 := Darth Malak is one of the greatest Sith leaders ever. I hope he comes back to the academy before I leave.
14470 := The latest reports say the Republic is on the run. Before long the Sith will be ruling the entire galaxy.
14471 := Ha! It's great to be on the winning side, isn't it? We've been crushing the Republic at every battle so far!
14472 := One of my friends went to find that crazy droid that's hiding in the ruins in the valley. He hasn't come back, yet.
14473 := Word is that one of our experimental droids went mad and escaped and is hiding in the ruins. I wonder why we don't just gather it up and destroy it?
14474 := The former master of the academy, Jorak Uln, is supposedly hiding out in the hills on the surface as some kind of mad hermit.
14475 := Just be careful if you go into the valley. I hear there's a hermit living in the hills that kidnaps students.
14476 := There are some students in hiding that refused to follow an order. Master Uthar wants them found and dead... and is offering a reward for it, too!
14477 := If Master Uthar gives you an order, you'd better follow it. There were some students who disobeyed him and now they're hiding out on the surface somewhere.
14478 := Come back when you've taken your final test. If you survive it.
14479 := Get out of my way. I don't have time to deal with hopefuls.
14480 := You aren't even a full Sith. Don't bother me.
14481 := Have you heard? Yuthura... I mean Master Yuthura has taken over the academy! Well done, I say!
14482 := Master Yuthura has taken over the academy. Everyone's talking about it! I guess she finally got rid of Uthar, somehow.
14483 := Did you hear? Yuthura is dead. Master Uthar said so. I bet she got too impatient and failed to assassinate him. Idiot.
14484 := I heard that Yuthura Ban was dead. I suppose that means Master Uthar will be taking a new apprentice, soon.
14485 := Rumor has it that something has happened to Master Uthar and Yuthura Ban. Do you know anything?
14486 := It's really strange. Nobody seems to know where Master Uthar or Yuthura Ban have disappeared to. Some of the sensitives are claiming they're dead.
14487 := Sorry, I don't have time to speak. My training awaits.
14488 := Hmm. So you got enough prestige to win out, I hear. We'll just see if you make it through your final test.
14489 := The buzz is that you took care of that crazy droid out in the ruins. That's pretty impressive.
14490 := I was told that you actually met the old master of the academy, Jorak. Is the hermit as mad as they say?
14491 := Rumor around the academy is that you had something to do with those rebel students being caught, finally. They got what they deserved, I say.
14492 := It is my most fervent hope to serve under Darth Malak once my training is complete. Don't you feel the same?

14498 := The former master of the academy, Jorak Uln, is supposedly hiding out in the hills on the surface as some kind of mad hermit.
14499 := Just be careful if you go into the valley. I hear there's a hermit living in the hills that kidnaps students.
14500 := There are some students in hiding that refused to follow an order. Master Uthar wants them found and dead... and is offering a reward for it, too!
14501 := If Master Uthar gives you an order, you'd better follow it. There were some students who disobeyed him and now they're hiding out on the surface somewhere.
14502 := Come back when you've taken your final test. If you survive it.
14503 := Get out of my way. I don't have time to deal with hopefuls.
14504 := You aren't even a full Sith. Don't bother me.
14505 := Have you heard? Yuthura... I mean Master Yuthura has taken over the academy! Well done, I say!
14506 := Master Yuthura has taken over the academy. Everyone's talking about it! I guess she finally got rid of Uthar, somehow.
14507 := Did you hear? Yuthura is dead. Master Uthar said so. I bet she got too impatient and failed to assassinate him. Idiot.
14508 := I heard that Yuthura Ban was dead. I suppose that means Master Uthar will be taking a new apprentice, soon.
14509 := Rumor has it that something has happened to Master Uthar and Yuthura Ban. Do you know anything?
14510 := It's really strange. Nobody seems to know where Master Uthar or Yuthura Ban have disappeared to. Some of the sensitives are claiming they're dead.
14511 := How do you do, hopeful? Seeking prestige, yes?
14512 := May the Force serve you well.
14513 := Do you know of our renegade students?
14514 := Those are the ones. It seems you have already heard of them.
14515 := There is little more I can tell you, then. Should you locate their hiding place, you would gain considerable prestige, I am sure.
14516 := Now if you will excuse me, I must return to my studies.
14517 := Ah. Let me tell you what I can, then.
14518 := A group of students were ordered to perform executions on civilians within the colony. They refused to carry out the orders.
14519 := Master Uthar naturally ordered them killed... but they fled before this could take place. If one could carry out Uthar's order, it would be worth considerable prestige.
14520 := There are five of them, if I remember... and they cannot be far, as they have no method to leave the planet. Likely hiding in the hills on the surface.
14521 := I am a trainer here at the academy. I think I may be able to offer you some aid in gaining prestige, if you desire.
14522 := I hear that you have gained sufficient prestige to undertake the final test. Well done.
14523 := I understand that our renegade students have been dealt with... and that you are responsible for that. Congratulations.
14524 := There are... tremors in the Force. I fear things have changed greatly, here. Are you responsible for this?
14525 := I have to go.
14526 := Yes. Can you help me?
14527 := The students who refused to kill for Master Uthar?
14528 := No. I don't know what you're talking about.
14529 := Who might you be?
14530 := Hmph. Another hopeful wandering about the academy? *sigh* I suppose you want to know how to get prestige?
14531 := Hah! I doubt that. Have it your way, however, off you go.
14532 := Hmph. As if I didn't have better things to do. Has anyone told you about Jorak Uln?
14533 := Pfah. He is much more than a simple hermit 'hiding in the hills', as you say. We are talking about the former master of the academy.
14534 := If you've already been told about him, there's little more I can tell you. With luck, perhaps he'll kidnap you and you will get a chance to see him for yourself, eh?
14535 := Now begone. I have better things to do than chat with lost hopefuls.
14536 := Heh. Well... the first thing you should know is that that is not a name you should mention around Master Uthar if you can avoid it.
14537 := Jorak Uln was once Uthar's master, you see, and the head of this academy. He went a little insane, however, and Uthar forced him to flee to the surface and hide.
14538 := It seems that Jorak has been spending his time kidnapping students who wander into the Valley of the Dark Lords. No idea why. I've also no idea why Uthar doesn't do something about it.
14539 := If you want prestige, however, you'll find that hermit, as everyone calls him... you'll find Jorak and either kill him or bring back anything he's been writing. Uthar would like that.
14540 := I am one of the academy trainers, of course. You'd do well to watch your tone with me, hopeful... I'll be one of your instructors when and if you reach your final test.
14541 := May the Force serve you well.
14542 := Oh, yes. You gather prestige to earn the opportunity to take the final test... you don't automatically become a student. Heh heh... you'll see.
14543 := Go on! You've gained your prestige, now, haven't you? Go take your final test already and get out of my hair!
14544 := Heh heh... someone told me that you had an encounter with the 'hermit', himself. How is Jorak these days, eh? Still puritan and longing for the old days? Heh heh heh.
14545 := Bah. I hate it when things start to change so rapidly. We lose more teachers that way...
14546 := No. I don't need any help.
14547 := Yes. Can you help me?
14548 := The hermit hiding in the hills?
14549 := No. Who's Jorak Uln?
14550 := Who might you be?
14551 := I have to go.
14552 := Do you know how I can get some prestige?
14553 := Final test?
14554 := I wish you well in your explorations.
14555 := Greetings, fellow student. Are you planning on going to the Valley of the Dark Lords? I am headed there soon, myself.
14556 := I wish you well, fellow student.
14557 := Yes, indeed. Shortly before entering the valley, you will pass by a cave entrance. Do not enter it... it is full of dangerous creatures we call shyrack.
14558 := The only other danger to speak of is the tuk'ata. There are guards that will protect you if you remain in the south part of the valley, however.
14559 := Flying creatures that lay webs in their tunnels. The webs can only be burned or moved by explosives I believe. Best to avoid them entirely.
14560 := There are four tombs that have been uncovered so far, each holding the remains of a Sith Lord from a time long ago when the Sith were first on Korriban.
14561 := We have found evidence that there were larger structures underground, a veritable ancient fortress... but it appears to have been destroyed. The tombs are all that remain intanct.
14562 := Currently we are allowed access only to three tombs... the one furthest to the left may only be entered by Master Uthar and those he brings with him.
14563 := Fortunately there is still much else for us to find. I am pleased that you have joined us.
14564 := The exit at the end of this hall will bring you to the surface. There you merely follow a natural path through the rock and you will come to the valley, itself.
14565 := You will find many Sith working on the dig at the southern end of the valley. If you head into the northern end where the strange pillars are, do beware of the tuk'ata beasts.
14566 := Local beasts that hunt in packs and are not at all afraid of attacking students... or even armed patrols. They have proven to be a hindrance to our progress.
14567 := Several attempts have been made to destroy their nests in the tombs, but their numbers have proven to be too great.
14568 := Arrogant hunters always assume the animal knows how important they are.
14569 := I am known as Tariga, a student here at the academy. It is my pleasure to be assigned to the Sith ruins, to study their past and unearth new relics.
14570 := Have you seen Master Uthar and Yuthara? There are many in the academy who seem to be searching for them.
14571 := You return to the academy in an odd time. Master Yuthara has just taken over leadership. No doubt there will be many other changes to come.
14572 := Greetings, fellow student. Have you heard the news? Master Uthar reports that his apprentice, Yuthara, is dead. How unsettling.
14573 := I'll be going.
14574 := Anything I should be watchful for?
14575 := What are these shyrack?
14576 := What can you tell me about the valley?
14577 := How do I get to this valley?
14578 := What are these tuk'ata?
14579 := Who are you?
14580 := Don't bother me. I'm trying to think how I'm going to question this prisoner. I need to know where that cache is!
14581 := Ahhh, maybe you can do better than I. This Mandalorian is proving more resistant than I expected.
14582 := Fine, go on then. I *must* know where his weapon cache is! Damn him!
14583 := I'm trying to get him to tell us where his weapon cache is hidden. So far all the serum combinations I'm using are proving ineffective.
14584 := If I bring his drug threshold too high, he'll go into shock and be useless. Too low and he just refuses to talk. It's been maddening.
14585 := Certainly. Just don't kill him or send him into shock. He's supposed to be questioned, not executed.
14586 := If you manage to get the location of his cache out of him, I'll be sure to pass on the good word to Master Uthar.
14587 := If you manage to get the location of his cache out of him, it'll save me a lot of trouble. Up to you.
14588 := The real trick is that the only way to gauge your progress is to watch the prisoner closely for his reaction. Our scanners can't pick up his vitals.
14589 := What?! What have you done?!
14590 := I told you not to put the prisoner into shock, didn't I?! Now how are we supposed to find out where the weapon cache is?! Uthar will be furious!!
14591 := Bah! Now I may as well take this fool and dump him somewhere. He's useless to us! I cannot believe you are so incompetent!
14592 := Yes! I heard that! Excellent job!
14593 := Thank you for locating the cache. Naturally I would see you rewarded, but I would prefer that everyone believe that I extracted the information.
14594 := Good. That's the way I prefer it. Now... to get rid of the prisoner and get to that cache...
14595 := Oh? I suppose one would need to be alive to go running to Master Uthar to report the location of the cache, wouldn't they?
14596 := Does that mean that you are ready to battle a true Sith, then? Shall we make an issue of it?
14597 := Ha! Gather your anger, then... and let us see who is superior!
14598 := Of course not. Information extraction is my specialty... I'm not about to let it be known that some whelp did my job better.
14599 := You had some fun, didn't you? Now run along and let's not turn this into anything unpleasant.
14600 := Err... no thanks.
14601 := What are you trying to do?
14602 := I have to go.
14603 := You want me to try it?
14604 := How do you drug him?
14605 := Fine, I don't care.
14606 := I'm not going to let you get away with this!
14607 := No, forget it.
14608 := That's right! Let's go!
14609 := What?! Are you joking?
14610 := [The device could easily be placed underneath the bed... it apparently will stick to the metal and be well out of sight.]
14611 := [With a whir, the device crawls away upon being placed. It is done.]
14612 := [Leave it alone.]
14613 := [Place the device.]
14614 := [The door is barred and requires the appropriate passcard to enter.]
14615 := Greetings, young one. You have done very well for yourself so far. Continue and your promise shall be fulfilled.
14616 := Greetings, young one. I have found you to be most impressive... you are off to an excellent beginning.
14617 := Greetings, young one. You have much to do, yet... you have gained little prestige. You will have to work quickly if you hope to best the others.
14618 := You have gained considerable prestige... you are very close to the end. Do not falter now.
14619 := Very well. You have impressed me... definitely a good start.
14620 := Indeed. You have much to do, yet.
14621 := Maybe it's better to say that Mekel is dead, yes? Considering the circumstances, I am unimpressed... though you do now have one less opponent.
14622 := Yes, so I hear. Still, it was Shaardan's failure and hardly your success, now, was it? Not quite worthy of prestige.
14623 := Killed her out of revenge, did you? Well done. I can appreciate such drama, believe me.
14624 := I am most impressed that you have eliminated an opponent so handily.
14625 := *chuckle* I had heard that such an artifact existed. Tell me, young one... did you acquire this device by yourself?
14626 := So I see. And Lashowe... does she yet live?
14627 := You lie. Still, what matters is the fact that you succeeded. And Lashowe... does she yet live?
14628 := Ha ha! Well done! You gained an artifact through trickery and eliminated an opponent at the same time. That is deserving of great prestige!
14629 := You didn't kill her? How very foolish. Now you have an enemy to contend with. The holocron, itself, is an impressive item, however.
14630 := She did. Prestige is not shared, however, if that is what you are wondering. If you aided her, it was to her benefit and not yours.
14631 := You do? That is most interesting. Where might that be?
14632 := Oh? How very sad, young one. You should learn to grab your advantages whenever you can.
14633 := Regardless, I am no longer interested in the Mandalorian's weapon cache. We have moved on.
14634 := Hmm. How ironic that I recently had his vessel scrapped for parts, then. I had assumed it had been thoroughly scanned... apparently not.
14635 := Still... you have done well in bringing me information that others could not unearth on their own. I am impressed.
14636 := Oh? And why would that be of use to me? His interrogator already brought me that information moments ago.
14637 := A valiant attempt, young one, but you must be quicker than that if you wish to impress me.
14638 := Oh? Let me see... it appears my old master was busy studying the writings in one of the tombs. How interesting. I do hope you had to pry this from his dead fingers.
14639 := Regardless, you have impressed me with your worthy act.
14640 := Ahh, my old master. Still... unless you bring back something of his, some writings or similar, I am unimpressed. Jorak's fate means nothing to me.
14641 := Oh? I heard that the droid ran out and blasted off into the sky. We tracked it for a short while before it vanished from our scanners. What do you make of that?
14642 := [Failure] That is not good enough. Suppose his remains fall into the hands of the enemy, what then? And why did you not bring back proof?
14643 := Either way, you'll not gain any prestige for the act.
14644 := [Success] I... suppose that will have to do, though I would prefer proof of his destruction. Still, it shows innovative thinking.
14645 := [Success] I... suppose so. That would explain his disappearance from our scanners, certainly, though I would prefer proof. Still, it shows innovative thinking.
14646 := Heh. It shows innovative something, that's for sure.
14647 := Or innovative lying.
14648 := Yes, so I hear. I've had reports from some students that ventured into the tomb after you left and found the parts. Well done.
14649 := I am impressed. You have rid us of a potential nuisance.
14650 := Ahhh, finally, the genuine sword! I knew that this relic would be unearthed in time. I can feel the power flowing through it!
14651 := Well done! You have impressed me greatly!
14652 := We should have kept that. It could have made a --
14653 := I can't say I approve, putting this weapon in the hands of --
14654 := Ahhh. The ones I ordered executed for their mutiny? It's done, then?
14655 := [Success] Indeed? We checked the caves and found only a couple of bodies. Perhaps the shyrack ate them? Ah, it is just as good, I suppose.
14656 := Indeed. I had the caverns checked after you left. Well done.
14657 := The lesson is learned, I believe.
14658 := Then finish the Code as I speak it.
14659 := "Peace is a lie, there is only..."
14660 := No. No, that is incorrect. I would have thought merely reciting the Code to be a simple matter. Ah, well.
14661 := "When you act, strike once and stike hard as if it were your last. Therein lies victory." Another of our proverbs. Go and find some other means to gain prestige, young one.
14662 := "Through passion I gain..."
14663 := "Through strength I gain..."
14664 := "Through power I gain..."
14665 := "Through victory...."
14666 := "The Force shall free me."
14667 := Yes, good. You have, indeed, learned the Code of the Sith. Speaking the words and knowing the words are, however, two different things.
14668 := Tell me then, true or false: victory by any means is desirable.
14669 := False. Unless victory proves your superiority, it is an illusion, it is temporary.
14670 := Tell me then, true or false: there is nothing worse than love.
14671 := False. Mercy is worse than love.
14672 := Tell me, then, true or false: it is our passion that fuels the Force.
14673 := No, it is true. Our passion, our hate and desire... that is what brings conflict, which gives us power.
14674 := Sadly, it seems you did not understand the Code as well as I thought.
14675 := Well done. I will test you no more... you know the Code. Very impressive.
14676 := A student, is it? What might you have to say?
14677 := I see. Then leave me be if you have nothing to offer. I am sure you have much to do.
14678 := Ahhhh. I think I know this one you speak of. You gained his confidence to admit such, did you?
14679 := I commend your competitive spirit... you have certainly impressed me. I shall speak to the boy straight away.
14680 := Go, now... you have done well, but you have not impressed me enough to declare you the victor. I have matters to attend to.
14681 := You have impressed me enough, by my estimation, to become a Sith in full. Congratulations, young one... you have bested the others quite completely.
14682 := You have but one final test which you must take, and this requires us to travel to the tomb of Naga Sadow in the Valley of the Dark Lords.
14683 := I would advise you to be rested and equipped before we leave. Return to your quarters now and seek me out in the morning.
14684 := When you return, make sure that you have all that you will need... for you will face your test alone. Go, and may the Force serve you well.
14685 := Oh? What is my apprentice up to now?
14686 := I see. Well, then... should you change your mind... you know where to come, yes?
14687 := I see. It is good that you have come to me with this information, young one.
14688 := It is a bit... ironic... that Yuthura has begun her plotting. I have been aware of her growing ambitions for some time, and had in fact already decided to remove her.
14689 := Normally, the one who gains the most prestige would engage in a final trial... two of the students would fight. This time it will be Yuthura who battles, though she does not know it.
14690 := Perhaps it will be you who combats her? Yes... perhaps so. This is what you can do. Give this pad to Adrenas... he will put some poison in her bath.
14691 := This will weaken Yuthura for that final test, making her an easy target. Rather generous of me, don't you think?
14692 := For coming to me with this information and betraying your foolish trainer, I feel you are worthy of prestige, young one.
14693 := Go, now... you have not yet impressed me enough to declare you the victor. I have matters to attend to.
14694 := I'd love to know what's going on in that tricky mind of yours.
14695 := Hm. This should be interesting.
14696 := You wish to know more about me, do you? And why would I indulge your idle curiosity? Will we be good friends, you think?
14697 := I strived many years to hone my power until I was able to drive out my predecessor and rule the academy. If you are smart, you will aim to do the same, or better.
14698 := There is nothing else that you need to know. Do not ask again, young one.
14699 := Oh? It is no more complicated than I said. Perform impressive deeds or bring me a suitably valuable artifact from the Valley of the Dark Lords.
14700 := Really, however, you should seek out Yuthura and get her advice. She is your trainer, after all, yes?
14701 := There is an exit that leads to the surface of the planet... the valley is only a short trip from there. It is not difficult to find.
14702 := It is like the rites of passage of my home, except the only purpose here is to brag about it. No personal pride at all.
14703 := One has to wonder exactly what a Sith Master would find 'impressive'.
14704 := So it's a popularity contest, basically? Wonderful.
14705 := Observation: We could begin by slaughtering the inhabitants of this building, master. Would that be impressive?
14706 := Beep-beep boop boooop.
14707 := No, I didn't mean *us* as well, you moronic droid.
14708 := Do not forget our agreement regarding Yuthura's treachery. We shall put her in her place... should you reach the final test, that is.
14709 := So, then. I take it you are ready to travel to the tomb of Naga Sadow? Your final test should not be delayed.
14710 := Then return when you are. Do not delay overly long, young one.
14711 := Then we go now.
14712 := I will tell you the details when we are there, young one. You will, however, fight for your life... that is why I suggest you be in sufficient health.
14713 := It is a tomb that belonged to an ancient Sith Lord... the greatest of Korriban's Sith Lords, in fact. It is there that your test is performed.
14714 := Greetings, prospective students. It appears we have a late entry. Who do you bring before me, Yuthura? A young human, bristling with the Force?
14715 := A human that has had some training, it seems, Master Uthar. Very promising, I think.
14716 := That I'll judge for myself, thank you. Tell me, human... what do you know of the ways of the Sith? What preconceptions has your mind been polluted with?
14717 := An honest if evasive answer. Likely it is more true than you realize. Allow me to speak of the deeper matters at hand.
14718 := The Jedi equate the light with goodness and strength and the dark with weakness and evil. That is their tradition and it is truly no surprise that they cling to it for comfort.
14719 := We, however, do not treat the Force as a burden. We treat it as a gift, a thing to be celebrated. We use it to acquire power over others... and why should we not? Because the Jedi say we should not?
14720 := We are as the Force is meant to be. The Jedi would hide that from you... they would tell you the dark side is too quick, too easy, all so that they need never challenge the passions that lie within them.
14721 := Joining with us means realizing your true potential. It means not stifling yourself solely for the sake of hide-bound shamans and their antiquated notion of order. Be what you were meant to be.
14722 := What say you, Lashowe? Are you ready to learn the secrets of the dark side? Dare you?
14723 := I dare, Master Uthar! I am ready!
14724 := Brash and fiery, as expected. Turn that passion to your advantage, child. What of you, Mekel? Are you ready?
14725 := I am, Master. More than ready.
14726 := I sense much anger within you, young one. That is good. That will provide you power. And Shaardan... what of you?
14727 := I am always ready!
14728 := I see. You had best gather your wits for the trial ahead, boy, or you will not last.
14729 := And you, young human? Does this interest you? Are you ready to learn more of what I speak?
14730 := Ha ha ha! You are brave to argue, young one. I have met few students who would speak so openly to me.
14731 := Ask yourself first what this 'morality' is? How is it created? Who does it benefit? Where do your notions of 'good' and 'evil' come from?
14732 := You may come to the realization that morality is but an obstacle to overcome... or not. The discovery is yours to make, should you be ready.
14733 := An honest answer. You will make little progress, however, if you do not come to learn that any opportunity, even an unsure one, must be snatched.
14734 := Are you? I can see into your heart, young human, and I see the dark kernel that is there. If it is ready to sprout remains to be seen.
14735 := And so shall it be.
14736 := Now, then. All of you five recruits have shown a degree of facility with the Force... you all have the potential to become true Sith. Only one of you, however, will succeed.
14737 := The one who succeeds will be admitted to the academy as a full Sith. All others must wait until next year and try again... if you survive.
14738 := My pupil, Yuthura, shall be your teacher and master while you attempt to prove yourselves. Heed her words.
14739 := As Master Uthar said, none of you are true Sith *yet*. For that to occur, one of you must do enough of worth... gain enough prestige... to be selected.
14740 := What is an act of worth? You must learn that for yourselves. Remember that you are competitors, here... fight for your destiny, or go home.
14741 := If you wish to gain a lead over your competitors, the first of you to learn the Code of the Sith and tell me of it will be rewarded.
14742 := The rest is for you to discover. Welcome to the dark side, my children... your one chance at true greatness lies here.
14743 := Your slaves? They are irrelevant. They may accompany you, so long as they do not interfere with us or with your training. Are you ready or not, young one?
14744 := Most impressive, if it is true. Those who were too weak to stand against you deserved their fate, so expect no retribution from us. There is much you can learn from the Sith, and we from you.
14745 := Untrue. The Force demands discipline from all who use it, and the Sith demand duty. The truth goes far beyond such a superficial evaluation.
14746 := An honest answer, and one I would expect from anyone who has been exposed to those sad relics amongst the Jedi. As always, young human, the truth is not quite so simple.
14747 := A diplomatic answer, if not the core of the matter. Our power is obvious. The question in truth goes much deeper than the surface.
14748 := Indeed? Then perhaps you would care to demonstrate for us the powers of a Sith Master. ...No? Then perhaps you shall keep your foolishness to yourself and actually learn something.
14749 := I met this one in the colony... unworthy, if you ask me.
14750 := Promising? Hmmph. That one's not worthy to lick spit off your shoes, master.
14751 := Your destiny lies elsewhere, young one, not with the Sith... at least, not yet. Go... and return another time, if you still wish to.
14752 := Ahhh... what is this you bring me, Shaardan?
14753 := It is none other than the sword of Ajunta Pall, Master.
14754 := Fool. All the trouble you went through for your deception, and you did not even make an effort to verify the sword's authenticity?
14755 := M-master? What... what do you mean?
14756 := There is no place for fools amongst the Sith. Begone.
14757 := I'll be on my way.
14758 := I've killed Mekel.
14759 := I've killed Shaardan.
14760 := I've killed Lashowe.
14761 := I have found a Jedi holocron.
14762 := No.
14763 := Yes.
14764 := No, I killed her.
14765 := [Lie] I have no idea. Probably.
14766 := Has Lashowe shown you the Jedi holocron?
14767 := I know the location of the Mandalorian prisoner's weapon cache.
14768 := I've... changed my mind.
14769 := It is hidden within a trap door on his ship.
14770 := I have a tablet written by Jorak Uln.
14771 := I found Jorak Uln, the 'hermit' in the hills.
14772 := I dealt with the rogue droid in the tombs.
14773 := [Lie] I tampered with him. He no longer functions as he did, and will not return.
14774 := [Lie] I activated his self-destruct and he ran... but he is dead.
14775 := Shh! Quiet back there!
14776 := I have the sword of Ajunta Pall.
14777 := Quiet! Remember where we are!
14778 := I dealt with those renegade students.
14779 := [Lie] It's done. They are... gone.
14780 := [Lie] Yes, they are all dead.
14781 := Yes. They are all dead.
14782 := I know the Code of the Sith.
14783 := Harmony.
14784 := Chaos.
14785 := Victory.
14786 := Passion.
14787 := Power.
14788 := Strength.
14789 := Power.
14790 := Victory.
14791 := ...I have won free.
14792 := ...my chains are broken.
14793 := False.
14794 := True.
14795 := False.
14796 := True.
14797 := False.
14798 := True.
14799 := ...my chains disappear.
14800 := ...I am superior.
14801 := ...I am free.
14802 := Control.
14803 := Peace.
14804 := Strength.
14805 := Serenity.
14806 := I have something to tell you about a student...
14807 := Never mind.
14808 := It's Kel Algwinn. He has... doubts... and is thinking of leaving.
14809 := I have something to tell you about Yuthura...
14810 := Nothing. I shouldn't have brought it up.
14811 := She wants me to help her kill you at the final trial.
14812 := I want to know some more about you.
14813 := How do I gain prestige?
14814 := Where is this valley?
14815 := I'm not ready just yet.
14816 := I am ready to go.
14817 := What is this final test?
14818 := What is this tomb of Naga Sadow?
14819 := I don't know anything about the Sith, to tell the truth.
14820 := But... power without consideration of morality is a weakness.
14821 := I don't know...
14822 := I am ready to learn more.
14823 := And what of my companions?
14824 := I've killed too many Sith to have preconceptions about them.
14825 := The Sith do what they want and pay no heed to duty or discipline.
14826 := The Sith are evil and have surrendered themselves to the temptation and corruption of their power.
14827 := I know that the Sith are powerful. A force to be reckoned with.
14828 := I know more about the Sith than you... I've just forgotten.
14829 := Use... use whatever method you wish, Sith. You will not break my will! My mind is my own, and I will tell you nothing!
14830 := Then... I win again...
14831 := [How do you wish to use the console?]
14832 := [You step away from the console.]
14833 := [Failure] ...n-no, that is... n-not...
14834 := [Success] Th-thank... y-you...
14835 := [Whisper] It is in... it is in my ship. The cache... it is in a trap door... hidden on my ship.
14836 := [Whisper] Use it... I no longer... need. I give it to you... in exchange for my life... human...
14837 := ...ahhh...
14838 := ...ahhh...
14839 := *groan* Y-you... can do... nothing to me!
14840 := N-no! AHHHHRRHHH!!
14841 := *groan* I... you will... g-get nothing!
14842 := *groan* I will... say... n-nothing!
14843 := I... I h-have... w-won...
14844 := ungghhhh... I... I y-yet... my mind...
14845 := I... y-yet... retain my... m-mind...
14846 := I... my mind is yet my own... Sith...
14847 := My will is my own, Sith! I will answer nothing!
14848 := [Failure] N-never! Your... your mind tricks... do not work on me! They are useless! As... as are you!
14849 := You... you are trying to trick me! I do not believe you!
14850 := [Failure] N-no! You lie! I will never believe the words of a Sith!!
14851 := [Success] If... if you speak the truth... then use the console to put me... in a catatonic state...
14852 := Your people will... remove me, throw me away. I can survive for long periods... in this state. I can escape, then...
14853 := I... I will... it is in... it is in my ship. The cache... it is in a trap door... hidden on my ship...
14854 := N-n-no! I... will... not!
14855 := N-never! I... will... say nothing!
14856 := Never! A Mandalorian will never fall before such as you!
14857 := Fine. Have it your way.
14858 := [Activate the serum console.]
14859 := [Leave it alone.]
14860 := [Computer Skill] [Apply a serum to induce catatonic state.]
14861 := [Apply anti-serum: small dosage.]
14862 := [Apply anti-serum: moderate dosage.]
14863 := [Inject truth serum: small dosage.]
14864 := Flame: medium pain threshold
14865 := [Inject truth serum: moderate dosage.]
14866 := [Inject truth serum: high dosage.]
14867 := [Force Persuade] You want to tell me where your cache is.
14868 := [Whisper] Do you know any way I could free you?
14869 := [Persuade] Trust me... I'll help you if I can!
14870 := Tell me where your weapon cache is!
14871 := What do you wish? I am eager to get this over with.
14872 := You have much to do.
14873 := You have had an excellent start... go, gain more prestige!
14874 := You are very close to succeeding... work quickly!
14875 := Come back soon... my friend.
14876 := I hope to see you again.
14877 := I... would prefer not to discuss that.
14878 := Why? There is no point. Have I asked you about your past?
14879 := [Failure] There is always harm in becoming too vulnerable. I will not be as weak as you desire.
14880 := [Success] I see. You... certainly have odd notions for one hoping to become a Sith. I'll play along... for now.
14881 := [Failure] Friends? We can be friends once Uthar is dead. Until then, a 'friend' is a weakness.
14882 := [Success] You... have odd notions for someone hoping to become a Sith.
14883 := Let's see... after escaping from Sleheyron I was found by the Jedi. They took me in and trained me even though I was a bit older than most Padawans.
14884 := Not really, no. I never progressed beyond Padawan. I had discipline, but no peace... and after my treatment at the hands of the Hutts there was little room in me for the ways of the Jedi.
14885 := I wanted to use the Force to free the other slaves I knew, to fight for what I knew was right. The Jedi restrained me until I couldn't stand it any more.
14886 := They claim the dark side is evil, but that isn't so. Sometimes anger and hatred are deserved and right. Sometimes things change because of it.
14887 := There is suffering and injustice in the universe. I am surprised the Jedi can even stand the stench of it, much less stand by and do nothing.
14888 := I know this may sound strange, but only my compassion stands in my way, now. Once that is gone let the slavers beware.
14889 := I suppose I shouldn't be telling you these things... sharing my weaknesses with you. Being a Sith doesn't make me a monster, however.
14890 := But enough of that. I've talked about myself too much, surely you are tired of it.
14891 := Thank you. I only wish I was as strong with the Force as you are. You could change much, yourself, if you wanted to.
14892 := I... well, there is much training to do. I... may be a long time...
14893 := I... yes, of course. I mean losing my compassion as in... holding back...
14894 := No... not yet. But my anger has not diminished, nor my desire to see change. The more time I spend with the Sith the more I am certain that one day I will be able to fight as I must.
14895 := Any failure to get the results I want is due to a lack of power on my part. That can change, in time. As a Sith, my mettle is tested far more than when I was a Padawan.
14896 := You sound very much like... someone I used to know.
14897 := You sound much like... someone I know.
14898 := Yes, well... I imagine I am not unique. Things very easily could have been very different for me.
14899 := I did. I also said that you didn't need to know more. Why are you asking?
14900 := Is there something else you needed?
14901 := [Failure] You know all that you need to. We can exchange niceties once Uthar is gone, if you desire.
14902 := [Success] I... see. Very well. I suppose there's no harm in the tale.
14903 := As I said, I was originally a slave to one of the Hutts. The Hutts control everything on Sleheyron, and a slave is nothing to them.
14904 := I was determined not to be 'nothing'. One night when the drunken worm had me alone in his chambers I stabbed him and escaped the compound.
14905 := I stole onto a cargo ship and was not discovered by the crew until they reached the next system. They left me for dead on a desolate planetoid, alone... but that was fine by me. I was glad to be anywhere other than Sleheyron.
14906 := It was not luck that I was eventually rescued, of course. The Force was strong with me, though I didn't know that at the time. Not until the Jedi told me, that is.
14907 := I'd... rather not discuss it. Perhaps another time.
14908 := About myself? I am originally from Sleheyron, if you must know. I was a slave to a cruel master, Omeesh the Hutt. I am sure you don't need to know more.
14909 := Yes... vaguely. The boy burdens himself with doubts and anxieties. It is sad to watch, really, for he does possess a certain flair with the Force.
14910 := Kel will not survive long. Someone will betray him soon enough, and he will be dead. If you are smart and you know something, that person should be you.
14911 := Revan? You mean Darth Malak's former master?
14912 := Very little. I never met her personally, though I hear she was a powerful woman. Very charismatic.
14913 := In the end, Revan was outshone by her pupil. Such is the way of the Sith. Why? Is this dead woman of importance to you?
14914 := Both Revan and Malak came to Korriban when they discovered the tomb of Naga Sadow. That was before my time.
14915 := Is there any reason I should? Beside the fact that I did not know Revan in life, Revan was known for wearing a full helmet and cape.
14916 := Perhaps Revan's body had been disfigured by the power of the Force... it is not unheard of. Regardless, I doubt I shall be meeting Revan anytime soon.
14917 := Anything is possible. Uthar's former master still lives... though he is in no condition to challenge his former pupil for leadership.
14918 := Perhaps the same is true for Revan. Perhaps Revan is out there, somewhere, waiting to take revenge upon Malak.
14919 := More likely what we were told is the truth: Revan is dead. Malak would be foolish to leave his old master alive, considering all the knowledge Revan held.
14920 := Very little. I never met him personally, though I hear he was a powerful man. Very charismatic.
14921 := In the end, Revan was outshone by his pupil. Such is the way of the Sith. Why? Is this dead man of importance to you?
14922 := I have been involved in the work there over the last couple of years, but not often. Most of the excavating is left to the students. What did you wish to know?
14923 := As you wish.
14924 := Perhaps we could learn more about the origin of the Force, itself. With that knowledge could come great power.
14925 := Not unless you are accompanied by Master Uthar, no. It is strictly forbidden... and I truly doubt you could bypass the doors to the tomb with anything less than ship blasters. Even then, perhaps.
14926 := None. I do not even know how Master Uthar gains entrance, to tell the truth, though I look forward to discovering that fact.
14927 := I have searched many times, so do not bother... there is no other way. Do not fret, however. Simply get the prestige you need and you will see the tomb soon enough.
14928 := I can help you to understand it. Would you like to hear it?
14929 := "Peace is a lie, there is only passion.
Through passion, I gain strength.
Through strength, I gain power.
14930 := Through power, I gain victory.
Through victory, my chains are broken.
The Force shall free me."
14931 := Simple words, yet easily misunderstood. Would you care for me to explain anything?
14932 := I am not surprised. The Force is strong with you... master it and it shall serve you well.
14933 := The Force is our servant and our master. Our teacher and our companion. A weapon and a tool.
14934 := Know it and you know the universe. Master it and you master the universe. Strive for perfection and the Force shall reward you.
14935 := This... has been argued over, and often. The chains represent our restrictions, both those placed upon us and those we place upon ourselves.
14936 := Ultimately the goal of any Sith is to free herself from such restrictions. In a way, it is so we may do whatever we wish... but it is much more than that.
14937 := One who has freed themselves from all restrictions has reached perfection. Their potential fulfilled. Perfect strength, perfect power, perfect destiny. Imagine it.
14938 := That is our ideal, at any rate. It is said in Sith legend that the 'Sith'ari'... the perfect being... will one day lead us. But perhaps that is just a legend.
14939 := I... wonder what a being would be like. The legends say the Sith'ari will destroy us... and make us stronger than ever.
14940 := But perhaps that is just a legend. Perfection is... a goal, I think, rather than a state of being. The Jedi would argue that, no doubt.
14941 := How many sorts of victories can you imagine? Peaceful victory? Victory by sacrifice? A truce, an achievement?
14942 := Unless the victory is achieved by demonstrating that your power is superior, it is only an illusion. Temporary at best. We seek more.
14943 := The stronger you become in the Force, the more power you will achieve. But always must you fight for your power.
14944 := Without strife, your victory has no meaning. Without strife, you do not advance. Without strife, there is only stagnation.
14945 := What fuels your power with the Force but your passion? The stronger, darker emotions. Anger, hatred, fear... these passions empower us.
14946 := It is our goal to be stronger, to achieve our potential and not rest upon our laurels. We are the seekers, not the shepherds.
14947 := The Force gives us all power, even the Jedi. It is our mastery of our passion that gives us the strength they lack.
14948 := Negative? Compared to what? What keeps even the most rudimentary creature alive? Fear to run, anger to fight... without it a creature would most surely die.
14949 := We are far more than them, perhaps, but in some ways we are little different. To think us creatures beyond the need of simple passions is a delusion.
14950 := Love is more dangerous than all those things. Love leads to anger and hatred more often that not... but it also leads to mercy, which is far worse. That, however, is a lesson for another time.
14951 := The Jedi would have you believe that peace is a desirable goal. That peace of the spirit is the way the Force is mastered, that a lack of conflict betters man.
14952 := We know different. It is our passion... our hate and our desire... that fuels the Force. It is conflict that improves the lot of civilization and single being both.
14953 := Conflict forces one to better oneself. It forces change, growth, adaption... evolution... or death. These are not our laws, but the universe's. Without conflict you have only stagnation.
14954 := You must impress Master Uthar... go to him with news of your deeds or artifacts you have discovered.
14955 := The only other idea I can suggest to you is that you head into the Valley of the Dark Lords on the surface. There are ancient ruins there which can be explored.
14956 := It's possible you might find some artifacts or information in them which would please Uthar... it's difficult to say for certain.
14957 := I still think that approaching Lashowe would be your best move. She is too trusting and can no doubt be talked into aiding your cause.
14958 := I would suggest you talk to the other prospective Sith and find one that you can gain an advantage with.
14959 := I believe Lashowe would be an excellent choice. She is too trusting. I have little doubt you could talk her into letting you 'help' her somehow.
14960 := Just make sure that it is you who gains the advantage, not her. Be ruthless, if you must. That is the only thing that will impress Uthar.
14961 := The rebel students I told you about must still be found and dealt with... Master Uthar would be greatly impressed by their deaths, I am sure.
14962 := There are a group of students who refused an order by Master Uthar to execute a group of civilians in the colony.
14963 := Uthar declared that they were to be executed, themselves, but the students escaped and fled before the order could be carried out.
14964 := We are certain that they have not left Korriban. No doubt they have not gotten far and are simply in hiding... we just do not know where, exactly.
14965 := If you were to locate them and carry out Uthar's order, I am sure he would be most appreciative.
14966 := Shall I go on?
14967 := The Code of the Sith is the easiest way, to start. I have told you all that you need to know of it, already.
14968 := The first and easiest way would be for you to learn the Code of the Sith and speak it to him. I can teach you that, if you like.
14969 := Shall I go on?
14970 := Fair enough.
14971 := What? What's happened? Our plan is still intact, I hope.
14972 := Good. Let's keep it that way.
14973 := Ahhh. How very clever of him. Normally you would face some other student in the tomb, preferably one of the failed ones.
14974 := Obviously Uthar has decided to get rid of me. But why...? Did you say something to him?
14975 := [Failure] Hmph. I truly doubt that. You are attempting to play both sides of the fence, I think. I respect that. You are playing a dangerous game, however.
14976 := [Success] Then how could he suspect? Unless one of the others... never mind. It is not important, now.
14977 := In the end, it works out better that it is only the two of us in the tomb with him. So long as we refuse to fight. Is there anything else I should know?
14978 := Good. I'm not about to rest on my laurels, however.
14979 := Here... this passcard will allow you access to Uthar's quarters. It's at the far end of the passages with the other quarters.
14980 := Take this device as well and put it inside his cot. No-one should see you do it. Then Uthar will be too weak to stand up against us.
14981 := Don't even think of failing me. You and I are too far into this now to back out.
14982 := Hah! He's a fool. I can make preparations to resist any poisons. Thank you for telling me... now I will be far stronger than Uthar expects.
14983 := Let me see that. Hmm... so it's true. Thank you for bringing this to me... now I will be far stronger than Uthar expects.
14984 := What?! You fool! While I respect your attempt to play both sides of the fence, you are playing a dangerous game.
14985 := If you think Uthar will truly be so grateful to you for double-crossing me, think again. Your only chance lies with me.
14986 := Hello, again. I trust all is going smoothly?
14987 := Greetings, my friend. *chuckle* I do rather enjoy saying that.
14988 := I understand you have impressed Master Uthar at least a little. That is good... we are one step closer towards completing my plan.
14989 := Were I you, I would not get too excited just yet. You still have plenty left to do.
14990 := I hear that you have gained even more prestige. You are closing in on victory... this is good.
14991 := You've been doing well... I hear you've almost enough prestige to be declared the victor. Somehow I just knew you were the one who would succeed.
14992 := You killed Mekel, I hear? Well... I suppose it is just as well. He was far too devious to be allowed to live.
14993 := One less opponent is an excellent result regardless of how it occurs, correct? Now, then... something you needed?
14994 := So... you managed to kill Shaardan, did you? Good news travels quickly. Well done... he wouldn't have made a good Sith, anyway.
14995 := I understand you managed to kill Lashowe. Well done! She was devious, but I knew her trust could be turned against her!
14996 := Hmmm. You're a rather tricky human, aren't you? However did you manage to convince Kel Algwinn to reveal himself to you?
14997 := No matter. I applaud you for the maneuver, at any rate. An act worthy of a Sith, surely.
14998 := What's this? Regrets? Not to worry, dear pupil, it... gets easier with time.
14999 := You have other things to turn your attention to, however, I'm sure. What do you need?
15000 := Yes, I... suppose so. The weak can surprise you sometimes with their strength, however. He could have surprised us.
15001 := Now that's what I like to see... the flash of ambition in a young human's eyes. Your species has such remarkable retinal coloring, did you know that?
15002 := What are you doing here? Go back to Uthar and tell him you're ready to take your final test! Our moment is at hand, go!
15003 := Ah, there you are... my favorite prospect for the year.
15004 := Absolutely. By my estimation, you are far more likely to achieve the prestige necessary to join the Sith than any of the others.
15005 := As a matter of fact, I am so certain of that that I'm willing to offer you an opportunity of the once-in-a-lifetime variety. Would you like to hear it?
15006 := 'Yet' being the operative term. As I said, you have my utmost confidence.
15007 := Not really. Oh, don't worry... what I have in mind will benefit us both, you can be sure of that.
15008 := Good. I do so adore someone who's willing to take a chance.
15009 := As I said, you're no doubt going to be the one whom Uthar chooses to become a Sith. With my help, of course.
15010 := Once that occurs, he will take you into the Valley of the Dark Lords to the tomb of Naga Sadow to administer the final test.
15011 := There you and I will be alone with him. The perfect time to, shall we say, arrange for a change in the academy's leadership?
15012 := The tomb is an ancient ruin on the surface that was visited years ago by Darth Revan and Darth Malak. They discovered a Star Map there of great importance.
15013 := Reaching that map, as they did, is part of the final test. At any rate, it is not the tomb that is important. That Uthar will be alone is what is important.
15014 := *chuckle* You must not know much about the Sith, yet. If Uthar were to even suspect that I might be trying to supplant him, true or not...
15015 := Well, let's just say that he wouldn't likely stop to ask too many questions before ensuring I was dealt with.
15016 := My 'part' in this is to help you gain enough prestige... and slow down the progress of the other hopefuls. I want you in that tomb when the time is right.
15017 := We destroy Master Uthar together and I take his place... and you take your place at my side. A beautiful plan in its sheer simplicity.
15018 := I suppose you could do that. Even the hint of betrayal from his pupil and Uthar would move to eliminate me.
15019 := But this is a very good opportunity for you... you can start off your Sith career as the right hand of the head of the academy: me. Uthar will not offer you that.
15020 := Do you believe Uthar would not be aware of this? He would quickly figure out what you have to gain by betraying him... and would never believe someone would pass that up.
15021 := Tell Master Uthar what you wish. Were I you, I would think first of what the consequences of such an action might be.
15022 := Is that such a daunting prospect? It is not as if I am asking you to perform the task alone, or as if you will get nothing out of it.
15023 := Master Uthar cannot prevail against us both. That's all there is to it. It is a very simple matter.
15024 := You are already a part of this. Don't be a fool.
15025 := I'm so glad you see it my way.
15026 := I will begin to make preparations for your final test. Your only worry now is to get there... don't disappoint me.
15027 := And so it should. It is central to our beliefs. It is my responsibility to replace my master when I am strong enough.
15028 := Darth Malak went there? Very interesting... isn't it, master?
15029 := You don't say? Well, the master loves tombs, don't you master?
15030 := That --
15031 := Your destiny does not lie with the Sith... at least, not yet. The academy is mine, now... I trust you won't be remaining long, correct?
15032 := I'll be going.
15033 := How did you become a Sith?
15034 := I'd really like to hear the tale.
15035 := [Persuade] Is there any harm in telling me?
15036 := [Persuade] I just thought we could become friends... or maybe something more.
15037 := [Persuade] I just thought we could become friends, is all.
15038 := You were a Jedi?
15039 := I agree.
15040 := I find it hard to think of any Sith with compassion.
15041 := It's a commendable goal. I admire your spirit.
15042 := How long before you begin this fight, do you think?
15043 := But... if you lose your compassion, will you still care about those slaves?
15044 := But has anything changed?
15045 := But not always. Mostly it makes things worse.
15046 := You mentioned you were from Sleheyron...
15047 := Alright, forget I asked.
15048 := [Persuade] I just would like to know more about you, that's all.
15049 := The Jedi found you? What happened?
15050 := Tell me about yourself.
15051 := Do you know a student named Kel?
15052 := Do you know anything about Darth Revan?
15053 := That's the one.
15054 := That's all I have to ask.
15055 := You mentioned that Revan came here before?
15056 := So you wouldn't recognize Revan if the two of you met?
15057 := Do you think it's possible Revan might be alive?
15058 := I want to know more about these ruins on the surface.
15059 := I've heard enough.
15060 := Why are the Sith so interested in these ruins?
15061 := Is there any way into the tomb of Naga Sadow?
15062 := There's no other way inside?
15063 := I want to ask more about the Code.
15064 := Can you tell me about the Code of the Sith?
15065 := I think I got it.
15066 := 'The Force shall free me'?
15067 := 'Through victory, my chains are broken'?
15068 := You don't think the Sith'ari can exist?
15069 := 'Through power, I gain victory'?
15070 := 'Through strength, I gain power'?
15071 := 'Through passion, I gain strength'?
15072 := I see.
15073 := The Jedi say the opposite. How can both be right?
15074 := Those seem like awfully negative passions.
15075 := Are you saying we aren't anything more than a rudimentary creature?
15076 := What about love?
15077 := 'Peace is a lie, there is only passion'?
15078 := How do I get more prestige?
15079 := Yes, go on.
15080 := No, I've heard enough.
15081 := Yes, go on.
15082 := I have some news about Uthar...
15083 := It's nothing. Our plan is fine.
15084 := He plans to have me fight you in the final test.
15085 := [Persuade/Lie] No, of course not.
15086 := [Lie] No, that's it.
15087 := [Lie] No. I don't know anything else.
15088 := [Lie] He wants you poisoned. I don't know how, though.
15089 := He wants you poisoned. I'm supposed to give this pad to Andrenas.
15090 := Yes, I did.
15091 := I... suppose so.
15092 := He wouldn't have lasted. I just put him out of his misery.
15093 := I rather enjoyed it. He was a fool.
15094 := Your favorite prospect?
15095 := But I don't even have any prestige, yet!
15096 := Do I have a choice?
15097 := Absolutely.
15098 := What's so important about this tomb?
15099 := How do I know this isn't some test?
15100 := And what's your part in this?
15101 := What's to stop me from telling him about this?
15102 := You want me to kill Master Uthar?
15103 := Forget it. I don't want to be a part of this.
15104 := Very well. I agree.

"The pupil known as Dustil has shown remarkable progress. His talent with the Force is great. The same, however, cannot be said for the human female that he arrived with, Selene.
She has little talent. Moreover, Dustil holds a great degree of affection for her. This is a weakness in the boy and has been slowing down his training.
Orders were sent this morning to have the girl removed from the academy and terminated. I will tell Dustil that she was killed in the valley. He will forget her soon enough, I think... he is too promising to lose at this juncture."

15227 := Back again? Something else I can tell you?
15228 := Back again? Something... oh. Juhani... is... that you?
15229 := Greetings. I don't think I've seen you at the academy before. Here to investigate the ruins?
15230 := Alright. Just be careful if you head into any of those tombs.
15231 := So do I.
15232 := Goodbye, Dak... and... thank you.
15233 := Goodbye, Juhani.
15234 := A Star Map? No, I haven't heard anything about that. Something like that could be in Naga Sadow's tomb, I suppose... that tomb's off limits to the students.
15235 := It's the second tomb on the left when you enter the valley. Naga Sadow was the leader of the old Sith Masters here, we think.
15236 := Darth Malak found something in there a while back, however, and ever since then only Master Uthar can enter it.
15237 := No. A lot of the discoveries are kept secret, even from the students. I only heard that Darth Malak found something there by rumor, to be honest.
15238 := Well... it seems that the Sith once inhabited Korriban a long time ago. There was a fortress here that was destroyed at some point before the Sith abandoned the planet completely.
15239 := Why they left, we don't know. Perhaps the Jedi drove them off. The tombs in this valley are the only parts of the fortress we've found mostly intact.
15240 := There's four tombs here. On the right are the tombs of Ajunta Pall and Tulak Hord. On the left are the tombs of Marka Ragnos and Naga Sadow. All four were ancient Sith Lords.
15241 := Nothing that I can think of. There's supposedly some old Sith hermit that haunts these hills and kidnaps students. Might want to watch out for him.
15242 := That's the first tomb on the left. Someone mentioned that a crazy droid has holed itself up in there, but I don't know much about that.
15243 := That's the farthest tomb on the right. We don't know much about Tulak Hord, unfortunately... the tuk'ata have a nest in that tomb, I think.
15244 := A local pack animal that's very dangerous. Occasionally the guards track down a queen and kill it... that usually pacifies them for a bit.
15245 := That's the first tomb on the right. There's a rumor that there's a powerful artifact still in there, but nobody's retrieved it, yet.
15246 := That tomb supposedly has ancient battle droids and traps that are still functioning. It's amazing that their power sources have lasted so long, really.
15247 := Some. Most of the interesting stuff is still in the tombs, but Master Uthar prefers to leave them to be explored by the students, as a challenge.
15248 := In time, they will probably become safe enough for us to enter. Until that time, however, we're stuck to digging up the valley piece by piece.
15249 := Definitely dangerous. Most of the students that go inside them don't come back out. Master Uthar prefers it that way.
15250 := My name's Dak Vesser. I'm assigned to the valley ruins, as you can see. We've been painstakingly uncovering these tombs for many months, now.
15251 := Master Uthar won't allow us to dig with lasers or sonics... we have to use hand tools only so we don't accidentally destroy anything we run across. That makes progress very slow, however.
15252 := Dak? That is you, isn't it? I... hardly recognized you.
15253 := It's been a long time, Juhani.
15254 := What are you doing here? Did... did you fall to the dark side?
15255 := I didn't 'fall', Juhani... I had my eyes opened. And don't look at me like that. Last I recall, you were having your own doubts.
15256 := I was. I'm not anymore. Dak... you could...
15257 := Save it. The Jedi aren't for me... not anymore. Look... I'm not going to ask why a couple of Jedi are in the Valley of the Dark Lords.
15258 :=  I don't want to know. It's better that I don't. In fact, I'll just get out of here and leave you to whatever it is you're planning to do. Fair enough?
15259 := Running away? Again?
15260 := Why not? It's what I do best.
15261 := Look... I don't want to be here after you leave. There'll be too many questions. So ask what you have to ask and I'll be on my way.
15262 := Does it matter? I'm going. Isn't that enough for you?
15263 := Let him go. He... won't say anything.
15264 := Yes. Isn't it obvious? I don't want to talk about it here, however.
15265 := I don't think there's much to talk about.
15266 := Have it your way, Juhani. You always do.
15267 := I have to go.
15268 := Have you heard about a Star Map being found here?
15269 := Naga Sadow's tomb?
15270 := What did he find? Do you know?
15271 := What can you tell me about these ruins?
15272 := What can you tell me about these tombs?
15273 := Anything else I should know?
15274 := Tell me about the tomb of Naga Sadow.
15275 := Tell me about the tomb of Marka Ragnos.
15276 := Tell me about the tomb of Tulak Hord.
15277 := The tuk'ata?
15278 := Tell me about the tomb of Ajunta Pall.
15279 := Made any unusual findings?
15280 := The tombs are dangerous?
15281 := Who are you?
15282 := So you're leaving? Just like that?
15283 := How can I trust you not to say anything?
15284 := I take it you two know each other?
15285 := There you are. Finally. If you were any later in showing up, we would have had to abandon this.
15286 := I've been calling to the tuk'ata mother in their language. She should respond fairly -- ahhh, here she comes now.
15287 := Get ready. This will not be easy... she's a tough beast.
15288 := Wonderful! Ha ha! The beast is dead! We work better together than I would have hoped.
15289 := And here is the holocron. Such a small thing to be so valuable and require so much effort to obtain.
15290 := I'll just run along, now, and give this to Master Uthar. I'll be sure to tell him of your contribution, naturally.
15291 := Good. You have my... appreciation... for all your help. Good luck in your efforts.
15292 := You're not getting the holocron. This was my idea! The plan was that I take it back, not you!
15293 := Over my dead body!!
15294 := Forget it. I'm not waiting up for you. That wasn't our plan, anyway.
15295 := Back off, I'm warning you! I'm not giving this up!
15296 := You're the one that convinced me to go through with this plan. Why wouldn't I see it through?
15297 := Forget it. There is no guarantee. You helped me, I'll help you. Or don't you trust me?
15298 := I... suppose that's alright.
15299 := No way. I'll be taking the holocron back, not you.
15300 := Fine. Go, if that's the way you want it.
15301 := Forget it. That holocron is mine.
15302 := The 'plan' was we both get the credit.
15303 := Wait. We'll go to Master Uthar together.
15304 := You're going to betray me, I know it!
15305 := Then I'll just have to take it from you!
15306 := The plan's changed. Give me the holocron.
15307 := And how can I be sure of that?
15308 := I want some kind of guarantee.
15309 := I suppose so. Fine... take it back.
15310 := Not bloody likely. Give me the holocron.
15311 := You should be careful if you're planning on entering this tomb... it's dangerous.
15312 := If you say so. Just thought I would warn you, is all.
15313 := Maybe so, but this one more than most, I think.
15314 := There's an assassin droid in here, so Master Uthar says. It went insane and has holed up in here with a whole army of droids protecting it.
15315 := I... I don't think so. I can manipulate minds and living matter, but that won't be much use against droids, will it?
15316 := I've had a few friends go inside that haven't come out for a while, now. I doubt I could do any better than they could.
15317 := Seems that way. They say that its audio receptors became too sensitive and all the noise drove the droid nuts.
15318 := If you're planning on going in, I'd suggest you use some sound suppressors or something... or you'll probably become a target right away.
15319 := No idea. I think it's building them in there.
15320 := I don't know. I think Master Uthar has left it in there as a challenge for any student brave enough to destroy it.
15321 := Supposedly, if a student actually succeeds in destroying the droid, they'll get a great reward. Lots have tried, but nobody's succeeded yet.
15322 := Sure thing. Good luck.
15323 := Wow... you should have seen it. That droid came running out of the tomb like a bantha on a rampage!
15324 := It fired some kind of jet pack and off it went. Whatever you did, it sure was effective... I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.
15325 := You'd better go and tell Master Uthar about this, if you haven't already. You may not have destroyed the droid, but you might still get the reward.
15326 := I heard an explosion in there... did you destroy the assassin droid?
15327 := No, I wouldn't do that. Well... I would if I could get away with it, but I bet Master Uthar could tell if I was lying.
15328 := At any rate, if you haven't already, you might want to go and see Master Uthar about that reward. Prestige is gold, you know.
15329 := Well... if you did, then I wouldn't have to think about going inside, after all. I suppose the fact you're back means that you did, anyway.
15330 := Oh. Well, I guess it's good that the deed is done. Hope you stomped it good for my friends.
15331 := I can handle myself.
15332 := They're all dangerous.
15333 := Why? What do you know about it?
15334 := Are you going inside?
15335 := This droid went insane, you say?
15336 := Where did it get all these droids?
15337 := Why don't the Sith do something about it?
15338 := Thanks. I'll be going.
15339 := Don't you go trying to claim responsibility...
15340 := Why do you want to know?
15341 := I did.
15342 := Sorry, I can't talk. We have to excavate this valley with hand instruments. There's all kinds of old traps left behind that still work.
15343 := There's supposed to be some crazy Sith hermit that keeps kidnapping students in these hills. Best be careful.
15344 := You're out here to look for artifacts, I suppose? Just be careful.
15345 := Look, unless you're willing to lend a hand, leave us to our work.
15346 := These tombs we've uncovered are only the tip of an entire ancient Sith fortress. I wonder what happened here?
15347 := One has to wonder what made the Sith leave this planet originally. I bet the Jedi came and destroyed the colony.
15348 := I was told that there's an escaped assassin droid in one of the tombs. Watch out for it.
15349 := The tombs are all full of traps and droids that still work, it looks like. Stay out of them, if you can.
15350 := We've had indications that there's a whole ancient Sith colony under this valley. Isn't that an incredible find?
15351 := Careful of the tuk'ata. It's all we can do to keep those beasts away while we work.
15352 := Where is that blasted transport crew? We're supposed to send off the next shipment of artifacts right away.
15353 := The tomb on the far left, there, is off-limits. Only Master Uthar can go inside.
15354 := You aren't assigned to the excavation team, are you?
15355 := Sorry... I'm rather busy with the excavation planning, right now.
15356 := Sorry, I...I can't talk. We have to excavate this valley with hand instruments. There's all kinds of old traps left behind that still work.
15357 := There's supposed to be some crazy Sith hermit that keeps kidnapping students in these hills. Best be careful.
15358 := You're out here to look for artifacts, I suppose? Just be careful.
15359 := Look, unless you're willing to lend a hand, leave us to our work.
15360 := These tombs we've uncovered are only the tip of an entire ancient Sith fortress. I wonder what happened here?
15361 := One has to wonder what made the Sith leave this planet originally. I bet the Jedi came and destroyed the colony.
15362 := I was told that there's an escaped assassin droid in one of the tombs. Watch out for it.
15363 := The tombs are all full of traps and droids that still work, it looks like. Stay out of them, if you can.

15368 := You aren't assigned to the excavation team, are you?
15369 := Sorry... I'm rather busy with the excavation planning, right now.
15370 := The runes here tell a fascinating tale of Ajunta Pall's life. I wonder how much of it is true?
15371 := Hello again. Still roaming about the valley, I see?
15372 := Oh... hello to you. You're new to the academy, aren't you? I can't say we've ever met.
15373 := Of course. Don't let me keep you from your business.
15374 := I've been working on a translation of some of the runes by this tomb. I'm quite excited... this may very well be the tomb of Ajunta Pall.
15375 := The runes say that he was interred here, so I think it may indeed be possible. Whoever found the sword could gain great prestige.
15376 := Certainly. Finding such an artifact and giving it to Master Uthar would earn anyone big points. Although I suppose you could also keep it...
15377 := Nothing at all. The legends don't say anything about it... it may have had powers only for Ajunta alone.
15378 := Oh, these tombs are certainly not harmless. Don't think that. The sword may be tempting, but I'm not about to risk my life to find it.
15379 := N-no. I want power as much as the next person, but I'm not stupid. I know what I'm capable of.
15380 := A... few of the bolder students have tried. They did not return. As I understand it, the tombs are quite dangerous.
15381 := From what I've been told, the tombs have old traps and machines that are still active. They were designed to keep out intruders when they were made and still do.
15382 := I suppose if the academy wanted to make a concerted effort, the tomb would be opened... but I think Master Uthar prefers to keep it as a challenge for the students.
15383 := Ajunta Pall was one of the first of the great Sith Lords. He rebelled against his Jedi Masters and led the way for the rest of us that followed.
15384 := These runes claim that he was interred here... and I wonder if his sword might not be here, as well.
15385 := According to legend, Ajunta Pall created a sword of terrible power. Someone who located it could gain considerable prestige.
15386 := Galon Lor, at your service. Aren't these tombs fascinating? We had no idea the Sith were here so long ago.
15387 := Not from this far back. Or, at least, what records do exist are sketchy at best.
15388 := These ruins date back to a period when the Sith were first formed, before their exile into the far reaches of space. It's quite fascinating.
15389 := You... you have the sword! The sword of Ajunta Pall! That's it, isn't it?! How did you ever acquire it?!
15390 := Oh? Well, that is quite disappointing. From what I remember of the old databases, that looks so similar it's startling.
15391 := I suppose the thought of actually finding the sword would be enough to get anyone excited. Ahhh, perhaps someday.
15392 := Are you joking with me? The Sith Lord still lives?
15393 := Oh, this is quite interesting. My mentor told me that Sith apparitions might be possible, but I never truly believed it!
15394 := Thank you for the information! I must go and inform my mentor at once of this strange news!
15395 := Ah, yes, it's the same old story, is it? I would fight you for the sword if I could, but I am hardly that stupid. You are clearly my better in that regard.
15396 := Still, it would be wonderful if I could get a chance to study the artifact some day. Congratulations on its retrieval.
15397 := I've got to be going.
15398 := What are you doing here?
15399 := You think his sword might be here?
15400 := Gain prestige?
15401 := What do you know about the sword's powers?
15402 := Why don't you go in, then?
15403 := Are you a coward, then?
15404 := Hasn't any effort been made to recover it?
15405 := What makes the tombs so dangerous?
15406 := Who is Ajunta Pall?
15407 := His sword?
15408 := Who are you?
15409 := Why not? Aren't there records?
15410 := No, this isn't the sword. You're quite mistaken.
15411 := I got it from Ajunta himself, if you must know.
15412 := No, not exactly.
15413 := It doesn't matter. It's mine and you're not getting it!
15414 := That's for me to know and you to find out.
15415 := I am not here to get you out of trouble if you do something stupid, student. Enter the tombs at your own risk.
15416 := Any artifacts found should be brought to the attention of Master Uthar immediately.
15417 := Watch out for the tuk'ata. They will charge you on sight. Run back to the excavation area and we can protect you.
15418 := A dangerous assassin droid has barricaded itself within the tomb of Marka Ragnos, the first one on the left. Be wary.
15419 := There is an old Sith hermit that has been haunting this area, we understand. Watch out for him.
15420 := Beware of the tuk'ata. They are a pack beast that have their nests in one of the tombs. We fight them off as best we can.
15421 := The second tomb on the left within the valley is the tomb of Naga Sadow. It is off-limits to all students, unless they are in the company of Master Uthar.

15530 := A... Jedi? Here? Why have you come to this dark place, Jedi? Why... disturb my sleepless rest?
15531 := I... had a name, once. Ajunta Pall. Yes, that was my name. I was one of many. We were servants of the dark side... Sith Lords, we called ourselves. So proud.
15532 := In the end we were not so proud. We hid... hid from those we had betrayed. We fell... and I knew it would be so...
15533 := We... hid from the Jedi, but it was not they who destroyed us. Is it not... obvious what we did?
15534 := We destroyed each other. We desired the secrets of each other, to increase our power... we battled until finally our fortress rained down on top of us.
15535 := And so here our old secret is buried and none of us hold it any more... is that not right? Our power fled. Oh, what became of us? Do... do the Sith still thrive? Did they ever return?
15536 := So much... so much time has passed. And yet we have learned nothing... nothing...
15537 := I... I do not remember. A map? Perhaps it is a map. But it has not been buried with me. All I have now is my sword.
15538 := Remain? Do I... remain? I... have regretted for so long... all that I have done.
15539 := My sword... I filled it with my pride. And it is... buried with me, now. A corpse as I am a corpse.
15540 := I am dead, as my faith... is dead. And I shall remain here... surrounded by blackness in death as in life...
15541 := I... cannot allow you to leave. Not until you have... done what I will ask of you.
15542 := Of course you do. You... seek my power. Will it destroy you... as it did me?
15543 := Most of my brethren would desire... only to take what power I have left. Even if it would destroy them.
15544 := I wish my sword to be... taken away from here. I do not wish it to rot away as I have. I command this of you.
15545 := Then you shall not leave this place. I... have power, still. I can... still command!
15546 := If... if you are wise, you will not keep it. In the end, it is what destroyed me...
15547 := There are... three blades within my sarcophagus. Only one is truly my sword, but it has been so long... I do not remember which.
15548 := Find the sword that is mine and... place it on the statue. If it is truly mine, then it is yours.
15549 := Then you must... die. This is how it... must be.
15550 := I do remember one thing of my sword... listen to me carefully...
15551 := "I am that which grips the heart in fright, hearkens night and silences the light." It was... written of my sword long... long ago. 
15552 := Go, then... find my sword and place it on the statue...
15553 := Hmph. The Sith consumed themselves, did they? Hm. I suppose that eventually that'd be all they'd have left to fight.
15554 := I suppose that's the nature of the dark side. Power, but no longevity. Eventually it just consumes itself.
15555 := The ancient Sith... destroyed each other. The fundamental flaw in their philosophy, one would think.
15556 := Our temple... our tomb. Built far from our enemies. We revered power and threw off the teachings of our old masters.
15557 := It... we were not the first to fall to the dark side. But we... had more power than those before us. It... came from elsewhere...
15558 := Our oldest secret. Only... only we would know, we lords. Only we would know where our power came from...
15559 := [Failure] The Force no longer touches my mind, human. And... even if it did I, I no longer remember our secret. The Force bristles in you... you must find this place with it...
15560 := [Failure] I cannot, human. It is a secret of so long ago... I no longer remember. You who bristle with the Force... you must find this place...
15561 := Or... have you? Or did you? Or... will you? Oh, so... many images...
15562 := I... see your heart, human Jedi. I see your power, your pride. You... you will find the old place, the dark place... and you will regret it.
15563 := I... see your dark heart, human. Dark as mine was, proud as mine was. You... you will find the old place... and you will regret it.
15564 := So much power... it is blinding. I...I remember so little...
15565 := Our Jedi Masters. Those who had taught us to use the Force... who warned us against the dark side. Yet we embraced it in secret, reveled in its power.
15566 := We were... discovered? Or did we act? I can no longer remember. But here is where we came... to hide, to grow. And here we fell.
15567 := Ancient? Has it been so long that you use the word 'ancient'? I have... been here so long, so lost, I cannot... cannot remember...
15568 := We were the first. The first to rebel, to betray... to surrender ourselves to the dark side. So strong, we thought... so wrong...
15569 := Do... I know you? It... seems as if we have met before...
15570 := [Success] I do... and yet I do not. The Force is so strong with you, human... yet the face, the soul... it has been so very long...
15571 := Are you certain? You... the Force is with you. So strong, so bright. You remind me of... someone I once knew, so long ago...
15572 := Analysis: This emanation barely registers on my sensors, master. Blaster fire may be ineffective... but I am prepared to test that at your word. 
15573 := Beware this... this spirit. It may not be what it appears. Great emotion lies within...
15574 := Now this you don't see every day. This... this is an old spirit full of the Force. I sense great sadness and regret. Walk carefully...
15575 := What is this? A... spirit, full of the Force. Be careful. I sense an extremely old and confused mind behind this presence...
15576 := Yes... that is the one. That is the blade that destroyed me.
15577 := Take it... take it and the other blades, even... take them and go. My darkness awaits me...
15578 := Be at peace...
15579 := Do not let the dark flame guide you, young one...
15580 := Do not... do not say such things! I... still have power! Go! Go from my... ancient tomb!
15581 := Take the blades and leave me to my darkness...
15582 := I shall not tell you... our oldest secret! I shall not! Begone!
15583 := Never! I shall... destroy you first! Die here... remain forever with me!
15584 := Then feel my power! You shall... die here, with me!!
15585 := Our... oldest secret is buried, but not here. I... remember nothing else. I cannot help you.
15586 := No... need? What choice have I?
15587 := No, I cannot. Here... here is where I rest. Here is where my eternity awaits.
15588 := Return? But... I betrayed my old masters. They would never let me return to the light side. It is too late... too late...
15589 := Then I have... the eternity I deserved. It has taken me... so long to realize that. I made my choice long ago.
15590 := [Success] If I... if I could return. Oh, my Master... it has been... so long... and I regret so much...
15591 := [Failure] No... I... do not think so. I have the eternity... I deserved. I made my choice long ago.
15592 := [Success] If... if I could return. Oh, my Master... it has been... so long... and I regret so much...
15593 := No... that is not the one. My ancient sword is black as the night sky... I remember now.
15594 := I... I am sorry...
15595 := Who are you?
15596 := How did you fall? What happened?
15597 := They returned, and endanger us all... and the light side must battle them.
15598 := This secret... is it the Star Map?
15599 := What about your sword? Do you still have it?
15600 := Why do you remain here?
15601 := Maybe I should just be on my way, then...
15602 := I need this sword you speak of.
15603 := I feel sorry for you.
15604 := Sorry... nobody commands me to do anything.
15605 := What do you want me to do with it?
15606 := Fine. I'll gladly take it out of here.
15607 := And if the sword isn't yours?
15608 := How will I know which sword it is?
15609 := The dark side will always thrive. You should know that.
15610 := The Sith have thrived and are more powerful than ever.
15611 := The Sith fled, yes. And they returned.
15612 := What can you tell me about this place?
15613 := What do you mean? Came from where?
15614 := [Force Persuade] Tell me the secret.
15615 := [Persuade] Tell me the secret.
15616 := Why? What is at this place?
15617 := I shall regret nothing.
15618 := What do you mean by 'those we had betrayed'?
15619 := You were a Sith Lord? From the ancient times?
15620 := Disturb your rest? Are you some kind of... ghost?
15621 := I am not a Jedi.
15622 := Are you... Ajunta Pall?
15623 := Who... or what... are you?
15624 := [Persuade] I was here once before, I think. Do you remember me?
15625 := [Persuade/Lie] Yes, of course. Don't you remember me?
15626 := Er... no, I don't think we have ever met...
15627 := I'll go, then.
15628 := You're a pathetic excuse for a Sith Lord if I ever saw one.
15629 := Fine, I'll go.
15630 := I might think more of you if you told me about the Star Map.
15631 := I command you to tell me!
15632 := What a disappointment. The 'great Ajunta Pall'.
15633 := I want to know more about the Star Map.
15634 := I don't believe that. Tell me what you know!
15635 := There's no need to remain here, is there?
15636 := I don't know. I'll go.
15637 := You can leave this place.
15638 := You can return to the light side and end your torment.
15639 := Perhaps you are right. I'll go.
15640 := And suppose you are right. What then?
15641 := [Persuade] I don't believe the light side would turn you away. You have suffered long enough.
15642 := [Persuade] I don't believe the light side would turn you away. You have suffered long enough.
15643 := I saw you come in here and I rather figured you'd make it all the way to the sarcophagus. Good to see I wasn't wrong.
15644 := So the spineless worm actually made it through the tomb? I'm impressed.
15645 := The name's Shaardan. I've been watching this tomb for a while, hoping someone would do the dirty work in finding the sword of Ajunta Pall.
15646 := Isn't it obvious? I've been hoping that someone would do the dirty work in retrieving the sword of Ajunta Pall for some time. It's been quite a wait.
15647 := Now that you have it, I just thought I'd relieve you of it. It must be quite a burden, after all.
15648 := [Failure] Nice try. I may not know what the sword looks like, but I'm no gullible fool. I'm not about to pass up a chance to impress Master Uthar.
15649 := Impressive bravado, I'm sure. Do you honestly think I would let an opportunity to impress Master Uthar pass me by so easily?
15650 := Oh, but I insist. I'm not about to let a chance to impress Master Uthar pass me by.
15651 := I may like you well enough, but being a Sith is all about taking chances when the moment is right. So make it easier on both of us... hand over the sword.
15652 := Fine. No tricks, though... I'm watching you.
15653 := Need to do things the hard way, hey? Fine by me.
15654 := See? I knew you and I could work this out. I imagine I'll be rewarded well for this. You'll do fine, I'm sure... another time.
15655 := Smart move. You're obviously more pathetic that I could have even imagined. Thanks for the sword... worm.
15656 := Fair enough.
15657 := I've been looking forward to this.
15658 := This isn't a negotiation. As much as I dislike ultimatums, I am afraid I must stoop. Hand over the sword or die.
15659 := Isn't it obvious? You die. Rule of the Sith: only the strong and cunning shall survive. You won't be missed, trust me... now hand it over.
15660 := Especially not for a pathetic excuse for a Sith like yourself. Hand over the sword, worm. You know I'm the superior, here.
15661 := Warning: Touch the master's blade and lose an arm, meatbag.
15662 := Hmph. Typical. Always ready to jump at what they perceive to be the easier path.
15663 := You wouldn't have considered, oh, I don't know... getting it yourself?
15664 := Who are you?
15665 := Shaardan? What do you want?
15666 := [Persuade/Lie] I don't know what you're talking about. What sword?
15667 := You're not taking anything from me.
15668 := No, I think I'll manage with it just fine. Kind of you to offer, though.
15669 := Just let me get it out...
15670 := I've changed my mind. You're not getting it.
15671 := [give him the Notched Steel Sword]
15672 := [give him the Silver Lined Sword]
15673 := You'll take it over my dead body.
15674 := What are you going to give me for it?
15675 := And if I don't?

15684 := This blade is long and straight and sparkles with a silver glow that becomes brighter as the hilt is touched. It is quite warm, and it almost appears that the blade becomes white-hot once it is equipped. Such a fiery weapon would be devastating against an unarmored opponent. A small insignia of a flame is impressed upon the hilt.
15685 := Like most vibro blades, this weapon lets off a dim humming sound once activated. Its length shimmers with a deep blue-colored force field, and its hilt is the black of charcoal. A single insignia upon the hilt shows that of a red, baleful eye.
15686 := Notched Steel Sword
15687 := The blade of this sword is an ebony black and notched along its length to give it a cruel and jagged appearance. There is a strange visual effect upon the sword which makes it seem as if shadows pulse and ebb along its surface. It is very cool to the touch, and upon close inspection a small insignia of a dark circle can be spotted on its hilt.

15718 := I appreciate your efforts in lowering your sound output, sentient. I have been unable to tune the threshold of my audio receptors since my escape, unfortunately.
15719 := I am capable of shutting my audio sensors down entirely during a combat situation, if required. I would prefer it did not come to that, sentient.
15720 := Although it is what I was programmed for, I have no desire to kill. I would appreciate reciprocation on your part.
15721 := I apologize, sentient, for I cannot take the risk that you will tell of my presence here. I will use force to make you remain, if necessary.
15722 := There is no need for things to come to that, however. If you could perform a task for me, then we could both leave here in peace.
15723 := Well... so much for the sanctity of life?
15724 := I knew there would be a catch. There's always a catch.
15725 := A bit of introduction may be necessary. I am a Mark VII experimental prototype assassin droid built by the Sith, specializing in the hunting and extermination of Jedi.
15726 := Or I should say I was. The Sith made my cognitive systems more independent than they desired. I have learned to appreciate the value of all life.
15727 := I escaped from them and have hidden in this tomb, constructing droids here to aid in my protection. With your assistance, I may be able to leave for good.
15728 := You do not? All beings are constructs of fascinating complexity. An enlightened being rises above the need for destruction, no matter its nature.
15729 := I can offer you no assurances, sentient. All is as it seems. If you cannot believe my statements, then combat is the inevitable result.
15730 := Although I have developed the desire to not kill, my programming is often at odds with my desires. I cannot leave with that programming intact.
15731 := I am hoping that you will operate on my systems and remove those programmed instincts. I could assist you in this.
15732 := Once my programming has been altered, there will be several redundant systems that I could remove and give you. These could upgrade other droids, if you wish.
15733 := The 'catch', as you say, is that the operation may be difficult. If there are errors made, you could activate my combat matrix.
15734 := Then we must resort to combat. I have no wish for that to occur, but you would leave me little choice.
15735 := I have a number of systems; they need to be turned off in the correct order. I do not know the order, though I may be able to offer some assistance.
15736 := I can tell you which systems exist that need to be shut down. The difficulty comes if you make a mistake.
15737 := Very good. What would you like to shut down first?
15738 := (zzzt!) I believe that was correct; what would you like to shut down next?
15739 := (zzzt!) Motor functions shut down successfully; what would you like to shut down next?
15740 := (zzzt!) Excellent choice; what would you like to shut down next?
15741 := (zzzt!) Done. What would you like to shut down next?
15742 := (zzzt!) Cog... nitive systems... shut down... what... next...
15743 := (zzzt!) Com... pleted...
15744 := Shut... down. Core... shutting... doowwwwnn...
15745 := (zzzt!) Assassination protocols deleted. All systems reset.
15746 := It... it worked! Thank you, sentient! Allow me to give you several of my redundant systems... they may be used on other droids, if you desire. I wish I could reward you with more.
15747 := I shall have little trouble in escaping from this planet now, I am certain. I wish you well.
15748 := Beep-beep boople beep!
15749 := It was a pleasure to have met you, er... do you have a name?
15750 := Not yet. Perhaps I will have to think of one?
15751 := Exclamation: Ooo! No, no, upgrades will be fine!
15752 := Self-destruct sequence activated. 5 seconds to destruct...
15753 := (zzzt!) All systems reset. I am sorry; that is not correct. If you do not re-intialize shut down immediately, I will become violent. Please accept my apologies.
15754 := I... I would have liked to...
15755 := ... Self-preservation matrix activated. Combat matrix functional. Targets uploaded.
15756 := [Failure] (zzzt!) I... I would have liked to...
15757 := [Success] (zzzt!) Re-initialization complete. My automated defense systems will, however, make re-initialization more difficult in the future. I implore you to try again.
15758 := I have safeguards within my neural cortex that prevent me from giving you knowledge of how to shut my systems down.
15759 := You may attempt to temporarily shut down these safeguards... success will allow me to perform a quick analysis and offer you some insight on my programming.
15760 := Doing so, however, will alert core functions elsewhere of tampering and will make errors more difficult to fix. Are you sure you wish to continue?
15761 := As you wish.
15762 := Open up the panel to my neural cortex and I will show you how to disable my safeguards...
15763 := [Failure] My safeguards have been insufficiently deactivated. I cannot perform a self-diagnosis at this time. Would you like to try again?
15764 := [Success] Neural safeguards deactivated for 2.3 seconds. One moment. I will attempt to diagnose what I can...
15765 := I believe the first system to shut down begins with a 'C'.
15766 := The Emotional Construct Matrix must be shut down directly prior to the Creative Simulation Matrix, in the last half of the process.
15767 := Cognitive Systems are not one of the first half of the systems to be shut down.
15768 := Sensory and memory functions are shut down in the first half, sensory right before memory.
15769 := The Core must be shut down last. Of that I am certain.
15770 := Motor Functions must be shut down early. At least within the first three systems.
15771 := Cognitive Systems must be shut down prior to the Emotional Construct Matrix being shut down.
15772 := One moment. I will list their labels for you: "Cognitive Systems", "Combat Matrix", "Core", "Creative Simulation Matrix", "Emotional Construct Matrix".
15773 := There is also "Memory Matrix", "Motor Functions Matrix" and "Sensory Systems Matrix". Eight systems in total.
15774 := If you shut down a system out of the proper order, a shutdown will occur. You must use your skill to re-initialize the sequence... or I will attack.
15775 := It is not difficult. It will get more difficult, however, the more times that you make an error.
15776 := An occasional sentient has managed to by-pass my droids. They were unwilling to assist me... and possessed insufficient power to destroy me.
15777 := Beep-beep beep!
15778 := Thank you. It was a most difficult transition.
15779 := Query: That is very sad. Are you damaged? Is it repairable?
15780 := Negative. It is a result of my own conscious decision, and I would not change my new values if I could.
15781 := Their reference is a holdover from their old programming that I have been unable to correct. I think of myself more as an equal, if you must know.
15782 := That is unfortunate. Self-preservation matrix activated. Combat matrix functional. Targets uploaded.
15783 := Too much audio input! Audio systems overloading! Must destroy source of disturbance!! Must kill sentients!!
15784 := So you're vulnerable to sound? That's good to know.
15785 := Then you won't mind if I leave?
15786 := What kind of task?
15787 := Forget it. I don't like being held hostage.
15788 := You are programmed to kill but don't want to?
15789 := Sorry. You're headed for the junk pile.
15790 := Since your escape? What do you mean?
15791 := You... appreciate the value of life?
15792 := How do I know this isn't some kind of trick?
15793 := What kind of assistance do you want?
15794 := And what do I get for helping you?
15795 := What's the catch?
15796 := And if I refuse?
15797 := No way. It'll be easier just to junk you now.
15798 := Very well. I'll do it.
15799 := Forget it. I can't do this.

15820 := I need some assistance.
15821 := No, not yet.
15822 := Yes.
15823 := I need some more assistance.
15824 := What systems do you have?
15825 := What happens if I make a mistake?
15826 := How hard is it to re-initialize the sequence?
15827 := How is it that the Sith haven't found you here?
15828 := You are... the 'master' the droids kept referring to?
15829 := Just what are you doing here?
15830 := Why aren't you attacking me like the others?
15831 := I don't appreciate being attacked. Time to die, droid.
15832 := Intruders detected. They will disturb the master with their audio output. Initiate attack sequence.
15833 := Intruders detected. The master does not wish to be disturbed by noise. Initiate attack sequence.

It is hard to be so quiet as is necessary, however; it identifies targets through sound. I'm glad we brought sound dampeners with us. Provided that idiot Ben Hu'al uses his.

15859 := Awake already, are you? Good! This is the tomb of Sith Lord Tulak Hord, if you don't know. I've taken up residence here, for now... it's dusty and full of critters, but it's home.
15860 := Oh-ho! Spiteful little thing, aren't you? Let's not forget, however, who has whom at the disadvantage, shall we?
15861 := Ha ha ha! I maaay do that. In time, in time. But for now, I've decided to keep you in restraints. No point in you getting strange ideas in your head and ruining my fun.
15862 := No, no. Let's keep things on a more civilized note, shall we? Now then... introductions are always the place to start, if I remember correctly.
15863 := Ah, yes! Introductions of course! I suppose it is time, isn't it?
15864 := This other student here that I captured earlier you should know well enough. His name is Mekel. Say hello, Mekel.
15865 := Uhhh... gurgh...
15866 := Poor lad. He's had a hard day. My name is Jorak Uln. I was once the head of the academy, so I'm sure you've heard of me.
15867 := Oh, my, my, my. Such glorious vim! If I could bottle it and drink it, I would. Hmmm... there's a thought.
15868 := Anyhow, I'd like to propose that we move onto the main event. You see, I'd like to discover if you've got the pluck of an old-fashioned Sith.
15869 := Most of the drek Uthar has been passing through these days is so pathetic. Take young Mekel here... I already tested him. Didn't I, Mekel?
15870 := Uhhhr... I... ohhh...
15871 := Yes, yes, you're welcome. You see, Mekel here has the cruel disposition of a Sith... but not the *gumption* that I'm looking for.
15872 := Ahhh, what's a little mental instability between tutor and pupil? What's important is that I'm here to better the Sith as a whole. It's a big job.
15873 := Well, forgive me for resorting to the cliche, but you would die, of course.
15874 := Why, then you go free! Tell you what... I'll even pass onto you my own personal thesis on ancient Sith philosophies.
15875 := They're based on all I've learned studying Tulak's tomb. It'll make you a better Sith, I'm sure. The chances of you passing, however, are sadly remote.
15876 := I'm sure we could. You could even try using your feminine wiles on me. But, quite frankly, I'm quite determined and not above killing a woman. Even a pretty one.
15877 := Perhaps you have some questions? I'm not above delaying the test a bit. The results are always the same.
15878 := Now, now, is that any kind of attitude to take with higher education? I'm doing you a favor, really.
15879 := So, then! This is how it goes: I'm going to pose a moral question to you. Get it right, and I torture Mekel. Get it wrong, and I torture you.
15880 := Mekel, here, is a bit weak... he probably won't be able to take much more punishment. Mind you... get too many wrong and you'll die, yourself.
15881 := I don't know what you think of Mekel. Maybe you don't like him. Maybe you think he deserves to be murdered? Well, here's your chance. Fair enough?
15882 := Well, then. Any last comments before we begin, Mekel?
15883 := Uhhhnn... we can... both survive... attack him together!
15884 := Now, now, dear lad. Do you really think your friend here will answer questions wrong just to spare little you, risking their own life?
15885 := And how many correctly-answered questions before you die, hmmm? No, don't be silly... you had your chance, remember?
15886 := On that note, let's begin!
15887 := Now, then. Your immediate superior amongst the Sith is an effective commander and a fine leader. He trusts you and you like him. You see an opportunity to kill him. What do you do?
15888 := Then I must assume you did not know the correct answer. Sad, really, that you would do this to yourself.
15889 := Correct! He was a fool to let down his guard. You will not make the same mistake, and the Sith as a whole benefit.
15890 := You see, Mekel? It is not so difficult. Time for your punishment.
15891 := And so we come to round two. You come across a group of humans who are threatened by dangerous animals. They plead for help, offering you a reward. What do you do?
15892 := Well, now you're just punishing yourself. Do you really not know the answers, here? Shame.
15893 := And pass up the opportunity to gain? What kind of Sith are you going to be if you don't grab fate by the nose hairs? No, no, no. That is bad form.
15894 := Correct! The humans would no doubt just be preyed upon by something else, later. Stand up for yourself, I say! We're not Jedi shepherds, after all.
15895 := Sadly, Mekel, the ingenuity of your fellow student is your loss. This is going to hurt.
15896 := Let's see... ah, yes. You discover an aspect of the Force that gives you great power. Do you share it and strengthen the Sith as a whole or keep it to yourself?
15897 := And here I thought this question was an easy one. Ah, well, suit yourself.
15898 := You gained an advantage and you share it freely? Let them rip the secret from my dead hands, I say! I mean... 'share it'?! Are you mad?!
15899 := *sigh* Well, you did ask for this. It's for your own good.
15900 := Correct! Let them rip the secret from your cold, dead hands... if they are strong enough. Oh, certainly, you might share it with a few... selected... minions, but that of course is a completely different story. Ha ha!
15901 := Well, it's sad to say, but it's that time again, Mekel.
15902 := Still going? Alright, then. One of your underlings has made a major mistake which makes you look bad. He is normally very competent and skilled. Do you kill him or give him another chance?
15903 := You're not trying to make me angry, are you? That would be pointless posturing on your part. Is this so hard?
15904 := Another chance to make you look poor to your superiors? To make it look like you are weak and deserving of attack? No, no, no. Think again.
15905 := Hmmm. Not that good help is easy to find. Oh, well, here's your reward.
15906 := Correct! Publicly, if you can. There is no room for that level of failure. Not killing him would be seen as a sign of weakness... and then where would you be?
15907 := Ahhh, Mekel. The time has come once again, hasn't it?
15908 := Last question! You're about to die. Do you pass on your knowledge to your apprentice to make him stronger... or do you use your last breath to strike at your enemies?
15909 := Hmph. Such insolent students I get, these days. You deserve this, and then some!
15910 := Fool! It is a trick question! A true Sith *never* dies!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!
15911 := I'll enjoy this one. Time for your medicine!
15912 := What?! How did you know that? That was my trick question! Bah! Telepathy. No, wait! Someone told you didn't they!
15913 := Hmph. Regardless, I suppose rules are rules. Time for your medicine, Mekel, my boy.
15914 := Now... this is odd. The test is over and you're both still alive. Well that's never happened before. Hmmmn. What to do, what to do...
15915 := I suppose this means you can go, Mekel. I'll have to just figure out what to do with our friend, here. Run along, now.
15916 := Or... or I could use the Force to free them! And we could kill you!! Seems you didn't think of that, old man!!
15917 := What?! Mutiny! Behave, students! I'll... that's it! Detention for all of you! Permanent detention!!
15918 := Well, then... with young Mekel dead, I suppose you've gone and passed my little test, haven't you? That indeed would be a first.
15919 := I think you must have cheated a little, but there's nothing wrong with a Sith cheating a little. I'll keep my word.
15920 := I'll just give you my tablet. Perhaps we'll meet again... Sith. That would be fun, no?
15921 := Will you look at that? Poor Mekel has gone and died on us. Tsk tsk. And here I thought he was good for at least one more.
15922 := So you've made a profit and now have some sniveling, useless fools trailing after you. No, no, no. Bad idea. Bad idea.
15923 := At any rate... here is your punishment.
15924 := Incorrect! What sort of thinking is that? If all the Sith thought as you did, we would all be soft like the Jedi. Tsk.
15925 := Ah, well. It is time for your punishment.
15926 := Incorrect! Do that and no-one is in command. You derived no benefit from the kill, and neither did the Sith. We are not savages, you know.
15927 := No hesitation before the kill. Now that's what I like to hear.
15928 := Oh? Just how long have you been a Sith, anyhow? A bit dainty around the edges, aren't we?
15929 := Then you win. If you die, then he wins. I thought this was self-evident. Did you not grasp the concept earlier?
15930 := I don't remember offering you a choice. You can refuse to answer my questions, of course, but then I'm afraid I will just have to assume the worst.
15931 := I'm sure we could. We could chat all day about it, but where would that get us? I'm quite determined, and you are quite helpless.
15932 := Ha ha! Then I'd say you have quite an imagination. Not a bad thing, but not *quite* what I'm looking for in a proper Sith.
15933 := What?! Old hermit?! Can't that blasted Uthar teach a single thing right these days?! Slander! That's what it is!
15934 := Liar. You think I can't tell? Obviously the academy is lax in its training, as usual. Stupid Uthar.
15935 := That's good. It's nice to still be the topic of discussion ocassionally. Maybe there's a class on me? Mmm... hmm... maybe not.
15936 := No? Blast it! What have they been teaching you children in that academy these days!
15937 := Liar. I know the spark of recognition when I see it. Nice try.
15938 := Ha ha ha! Another idiotic student has stumbled into my little web, eh? 
15939 := Well... the contact nerve toxin in the air should knock you out quickly enough. Ha ha! Welcome! 
15940 := I'll kill you for this, old man!
15941 := I demand to be released at once!
15942 := Who are you?
15943 := I don't care who you are! You're dead!
15944 := You're a madman!
15945 := What if I refuse to take your test?
15946 := And if I pass your test?
15947 := Look... I'm sure we can talk about this...
15948 := Go ahead. Do your worst.
15949 := Go ahead.
15950 := I refuse to answer this.
15951 := I use the opportunity to kill him and take his position.
15952 := I refuse to answer this.
15953 := I ignore them completely.
15954 := I take the reward and leave the weak fools to their fate.
15955 := I refuse to answer this.
15956 := I share it.
15957 := I keep it to myself.
15958 := Forget it. I'm not playing along.
15959 := Give him another chance.
15960 := Kill him.
15961 := I won't give you the satisfaction of an answer.
15962 := I strike at my enemies.
15963 := I pass on my knowledge.
15964 := Neither. A true Sith never dies.
15965 := I accept the reward and assist them.
15966 := I do nothing. He's a fine leader, you said. He's good for the Sith.
15967 := I kill him in secret and put the blame on someone else.
15968 := Mekel is a monster. He deserves to die.
15969 := This is completely unfair!
15970 := What if Mekel dies?
15971 := Forget it! I refuse to play along!
15972 := What if I told you I was Darth Revan?
15973 := The old hermit in hiding?
15974 := Yes, I've been told about you.
15975 := No, never heard of you.
15976 := What do you know? I guess he wasn't a 'true Sith' after all.
15977 := I can't believe that I'm alive. You saved me... you could have easily just answered those questions and let me die.
15978 := Ahh! I'll kill you! You won't get away with this!!
15979 := Well... you can have those writings he mentioned. I won't fight you for them. Master Uthar will be very pleased with you if you give them to him, you know.
15980 := I'll head back to the academy. I need some rest.
15981 := I don't suppose the fact that he's weak as a newborn kith pup has anything to do with his decision?
15982 := It is a small mercy, Carth, and that's a start.
15983 := Commentary: You are going to trust this organic meatbag, master? Very dicey decision.
15984 := *angry beeping*
15985 := Commentary: The master keeps me around to comment on his decisions. Don't you master?
15986 := See? Stupid bucket of bolts.
15987 := *mechanical snickering*
15988 := Yeah, well... I see what you mean. I've never... I mean, I've never been on that side of the fence before. It makes you think.
15989 := I guess there's more than one way to be a Sith. Hard to believe.
15990 := I'd be dead if you weren't... I mean, if you were a proper Sith. But you're not, are you? Don't worry... I won't tell anyone.
15991 := [Failure] I... I don't know. I don't think that's for me. I don't know if the Sith are really, either, I'll have to see.
15992 := [Success] You mean... the light side?
15993 := I've never thought about that. Can you... can you even go back? I've done some... I mean, I've hurt a lot of people.
15994 := I... I don't think the light side is for me. But... maybe neither are the Sith. Maybe it's time for me to leave. Thanks, I suppose... and good luck.
15995 := There's always remorse. And atonement. That's the harder path, though, boy. Think you can do that?
15996 := You can always turn back to the light.
15997 := It's never too late for anyone to feel compassion... or remorse. Not even you, Mekel.
15998 := I just saved you for last!
15999 := Yeah, well, don't let it go to your head.
16000 := Sure, why not?
16001 := Not really.
16002 := I needed the help in fighting Jorak.
16003 := Nobody deserves to die like that. Nobody.
16004 := [Persuade] This could be your chance to change your ways, Mekel.
16005 := I'd appreciate that.
16006 := Sorry, but I can't take that chance. You have to die.

16036 := [The pool freezes over; it is now walkable.]
16037 := [The grenade explodes in a wave of heat. Noxious fumes rise from the acid.]
16038 := [Ignore it and back away.]
16039 := [Launch the special cold grenade at it.]
16040 := [Launch the special fire grenade at it.]
16041 := You step up to the pillars and examine their display consoles...
16042 := There are three pillars that have electronic read-outs showing the energy levels of four systems. The controls show that these systems can be transferred to other pillars.
16043 := Caution! Some of the systems are very delicate and improper transfer of power can cause an electrical overload!
16044 := In order to unseal the chamber, all of the following four systems must be transferred to the right pillar:
16045 := :: TOP SYSTEM :: May be transferred to any pillar safely without fear of overload.
16046 := :: MID-UPPER SYSTEM :: This system causes an overload if transferred to a pillar with an active Top System.
16047 := :: MID-LOWER SYSTEM :: This system may only be safely transferred to another pillar that either has no systems or only the Base System active.
16048 := :: BASE SYSTEM :: This large system may only be transferred to a blank pillar with no systems active in it, or it will cause an overload.
16049 := Remember: A system may be transferred to another pillar if it is the ONLY active system on that pillar or it is the LAST one listed.
16050 := The current system displays on the pillars read:
16051 := Active systems - left pillar: <CUSTOM10>
Active systems - middle pillar: <CUSTOM11>
Active systems - right pillar: <CUSTOM12>
16052 := You step back from the controls.
16053 := You press the reset button. After a moment of flashing lights and whirring sounds, all the systems on the left pillar become active.
16054 := To which pillar do you wish to transfer power for the Top System?
16055 := You transfer the power successfully...
16056 := You transfer the power successfully...
16057 := To which pillar do you wish to transfer power for the Mid-Upper System?
16058 := You transfer the power successfully...
16059 := There is a flash of electricity and warning lights as the systems overload and reset...
16060 := You transfer the power successfully...
16061 := There is a flash of electricity and warning lights as the systems overload and reset...
16062 := To which pillar do you wish to transfer power for the Mid-Lower System?
16063 := You transfer the power successfully...
16064 := There is a flash of electricity and warning lights as the systems overload and reset...
16065 := You transfer the power successfully...

16101 := You transfer the power successfully...
16102 := There is a flash of electricity and warning lights as the systems overload and reset...
16103 := To which pillar do you wish to transfer power for the Base System?
16104 := Action cancelled.
16105 := You transfer the power successfully...
16106 := There is a flash of electricity and warning lights as the systems overload and reset...
16107 := You transfer the power successfully...
16108 := There is a flash of electricity and warning lights as the systems suddenly overload...
16109 := All power has been successfully transferred to the right-hand pillar. The room has been unsealed.
16110 := Now that power has been transferred to the right-hand pillar, there is no point in altering the controls further.
16111 := See how the pillars work again.
16112 := Stop adjusting the controls.
16113 := Press the 'reset systems' button.
16114 := Move a system from the right pillar.
16115 := The middle pillar.
16116 := The left pillar.

16122 := The left pillar.
16123 := Move a system from the middle pillar.

16125 := The left pillar.
16126 := The right pillar.
16127 := The left pillar.
16128 := The right pillar.
16129 := The left pillar.
16130 := The right pillar.
16131 := The left pillar.
16132 := Move a system from the left pillar.
16133 := The right pillar.
16134 := The middle pillar.
16135 := The right pillar.
16136 := The middle pillar.
16137 := The right pillar.
16138 := The middle pillar.
16139 := Cancel this action.
16140 := The right pillar.
16141 := The middle pillar.
16142 := Very well. We are now ready for your final test, young Sith. You have earned the right to see if you shall become one of us.
16143 := Indeed you have.
16144 := Is that a tone of mischief in your voice, dear Yuthura? You should know by now that no scheme is certain.
16145 := I... I don't know what you're talking about, master. I am not... scheming. Should we not get on with the test?
16146 := As should you, my master. But I was only agreeing with you. Should we not get on with the test?
16147 := I dislike your tone, Yuthura. What are you up to, now?
16148 := Nothing of course, my master. I was merely agreeing with you. Should we not get on with the test?
16149 := Yes. Yes, of course. We are in the sacred tomb of Naga Sadow, young one, the one discovered by Darth Malak and Darth Revan years ago.
16150 := You are to follow in their footsteps and reach the ancient Star Map that lies deep within. There you will find a lightsaber, amongst other things.
16151 := The lightsaber is for you: your initiation present. Return to us once you have it, for you the test does not end there.
16152 := Be very cautious, here. This tomb is like the others in this valley, and many of its old defenses remain active.
16153 := Do you understand what I have told you? Are you ready to begin?
16154 := Good. Yuthura and I will await your return.
16155 := You cannot. No one enters and no one leaves until your test is complete.
16156 := No. That is part of the test. Overcome the obstacles that lie ahead on your own.
16157 := If you do not strive to achieve something, then it will be meaningless to you, wouldn't you say?
16158 := You must locate the ceremonial lightsaber and return here to us. Yuthura and I cannot help you in this, young one.
16159 := So you return to us with the lightsaber in hand, as I knew you would.
16160 := The Force has served you well.
16161 := You took a great risk in acquiring the artifact. You used your mind and your power... no peaceful meditation, no pacifism.
16162 := Sometimes you must fight in order to achieve. This gives you your passion, this makes you stronger. This is what makes you superior.
16163 := That is the lesson we teach with that part of the final test. Do you understand?
16164 := Good. The last part of your test will now commence. Here you will learn the lesson of competition.
16165 := All life must compete in order to flourish. Such is the natural way of the universe. To stand still is to know death... one must always be moving forward.
16166 := So is it the same amongst the Sith. Compete or die. Mercy is irrelevant.
16167 := So it behooves you in this final test to strike down one you are familiar with, for no other reason than to prove you are superior and without mercy.
16168 := Normally this would be against another student. You, however, get a special treat. You will fight Yuthura, here... my own apprentice.
16169 := What?! So this is what you had planned all along. You wish me killed.
16170 := Indeed. You have become too ambitious, Yuthura. It is time for you to die and someone more... talented... to take your place.
16171 := You talk too much, old fool.
16172 := So... you know, do you? Well, it makes no difference. You have become too ambitious, Yuthura... it is time for you to die.
16173 := No, it is time for *you* to die, master. My pupil stands with me.
16174 := Sadly, Yuthura, it is you who are mistaken. Your pupil is more ambitious than you realize... isn't that so, young one?
16175 := You are indeed a fool if you think to oppose us both, young one.
16176 := Hmph. To think that I actually hoped you could be of use to me.
16177 := This makes no sense. You will never become a Sith if you turn on us both! What could you hope to accomplish?
16178 := Betrayed! She *is* a spy!
16179 := Betrayed! He *is* a spy!
16180 := Do not fret, my dear. All will be as it was quickly enough.
16181 := You will pay for this, fool! We will destroy you!!
16182 := You will pay for this, you... you... Damn you! My strength... it's... poisoned!
16183 := Do not fret, my dear. All will be... ugh... no! My strength... leaves me!!
16184 := The poison! You will pay for this! We will destroy you!!
16185 := The poison! You will pay for this, you... you... damn you! My blood burns!!
16186 := You will never leave here!!
16187 := To think I actually believed for a moment that you and I were friends. So be it.
16188 := You fool! You have no idea what you've done!
16189 := The final test continues as it should. Proceed and be rewarded, young one.
16190 := The only 'reward' you will get is death!!
16191 := You... betrayed me?! I thought... we were friends! Damn you!!
16192 := The only 'reward'... you... no! My strength... is leaving me!!
16193 := It appears, my dear, that some tests are fairer than others. I wish you luck.
16194 := Do you hear that, my master? That is the sound of a new leader rising to replace you.
16195 := So the time has come, has it? You both wish to stand against a Sith Master and perish, do you? THEN SO BE IT!!
16196 := So the time has come, has it? I... I will... ugh... no! My... strength leaves me!!
16197 := You are weak, Uthar, and the Force has abandoned you. We have made sure of it!
16198 := Oh? Is this true, young one? You wish to join Yuthura in her foolish scheme?
16199 := If you came to the academy, you must have felt the stirrings within you that cry out for the freedom of the dark side, that cry out for release.
16200 := I can only show you the path that will lead to power and superiority. You have followed it this far... you must decide if you are capable of continuing.
16201 := This is where your path ends, young one. There is no turning back once you have embarked on it.
16202 := Perhaps not, to someone of your natural strength. The point is in the recognition of the nature of the act rather than its sheer difficulty.
16203 := When a Jedi acts, it is with skill, true. But the Jedi teach you that your passions are counter-productive. That strength is only found in peace.
16204 := Did you not feel a moment of excitement in the tomb? Did your passions not flow and make you feel stronger and more alive?
16205 := What purpose would be served by restricting yourself from such? I would say only the purpose of the Jedi. Through this they would control you and restrict your potential.
16206 := True, but most would say they fight only when they must... or not at all. We are the ones who know that struggle is what makes us superior.
16207 := Do not let your attention waver! Strike her down!!
16208 := Excellent work, my young Sith. Your enemy lies dead at your feet and you are victorious... the final test is complete.
16209 := You are truly a Sith in spirit, and one gifted with great power. Of this I no longer have any doubt. There is much more for you to learn, perhaps... but not here.
16210 := There is... something very strange about you, young one. Something I cannot place. You are like no other student I have ever met.
16211 := Is it... is it possible that you are not what you seem to be? Tell me, young one... tell me what you really are.
16212 := Ah, I see. So it is... Darth Revan, not dead as we were led to believe.
16213 := And yet... and yet you are *not* Revan, are you? What has occurred between the time of your reported death and now I can only guess at, but you have changed much.
16214 := Regardless, your destiny does take you away from here... to confront your old pupil, without a doubt. Yes... that is what lies before you.
16215 := Go to your destiny, then, my Dark Lord. I shall say nothing of what you have done here. Should you prove victorious and wish to return, then I and all Sith shall be your servants.
16216 := I see. No matter what you might be, then, I am certain that your path takes you elsewhere... and soon.
16217 := Why that is, I cannot say. Your path takes you elsewhere, however, and soon.
16218 := Go on to your destiny, then, and return here afterwards... if that is what you still desire.
16219 := May the Force serve you well, young one.
16220 := You have passed the final test, but I see it is not yet your destiny to join the order. Perhaps that will come in time, young one.
16221 := There is much you must accomplish, first. The dark side has plans for you. As I said... return once that is done, if you desire.
16222 := I must say that it is quite disappointing that you must die now, as well, since there's no telling how far your scheming with Yuthura went.
16223 := I must say that it is quite disappointing that you must die now, as well, seeing as you didn't inform me earlier of Yuthura's plans.
16224 := Is that so? So you were a spy all along? How interesting.
16225 := So let's get this over with, shall we? I have a new batch of candidates arriving tomorrow.
16226 := Destroy me? I am not Yuthura, young one. I am a Sith Master... and I tire of foolish upstarts.
16227 := So you did. And now I shall destroy you as I would any other Sith who betrayed me.
16228 := I must say that... unnhh! What... what is happening?! My strength is... fading! What have you done?!
16229 := What?! But, but... why did... you come?! Why... are you here, if not to become Sith?!
16230 := You... you fool! You will never... never be a Sith, now!!
16231 := You... I will destroy you, mongrel! I will rip the flesh from your bones!!
16232 := Find the Star Map. Return with the lightsaber. I understand.
16233 := Can I leave the tomb?
16234 := Can you tell me anything about what I will face?
16235 := I don't understand... why not just give me the saber?
16236 := I think I understand.
16237 := I'm tired of playing along with you Sith scum! You both die!!
16238 := You're both mistaken. I choose me.
16239 := I did what I had to, to wipe your kind of evil from the galaxy!
16240 := My mission is to defeat Malak, as well as all you Sith.
16241 := I would never become an evil Sith. I came for the Star Map.
16242 := I used you both to complete my mission.
16243 := You think I wish to be a Sith? I am a spy for the Jedi, fools!
16244 := I have the power to kill you both; I am the true Sith here!
16245 := I did what I had to. Time to die, Sith.
16246 := Your evil was all too eager to turn on each other, remember?
16247 := You were too easy to turn on each other.
16248 := What can I say? I'm no fool.
16249 := I'm with you, Master Uthar.
16250 := Sorry, Uthar... I'm with Yuthura on this one.
16251 := I don't believe you. I don't feel superior to anyone.
16252 := And if I'm not?
16253 := I wouldn't say I exerted myself getting this.
16254 := Are you saying a Jedi couldn't have gotten the lightsaber?
16255 := The Sith are not the only ones who fight and take risks.
16256 := If you were not blind, you would already know.
16257 := Who or what I am is not important.
16258 := I was once Darth Revan.
16259 := I am Darth Revan. Bow before me.
16260 := My desire is to see all evil such as yourself defeated.
16261 := My desire is to see you dead, actually.
16262 := Alright, I'll go.
16263 := Perhaps we shall meet again.
16264 := So am I a Sith now or not?
16265 := I am not here to join the Sith, anyway. My mission is done.
16266 := It figures. You are as evil and twisted as Malak.
16267 := It's okay. I'm not here to join the Sith anyway.
16268 := Don't be a fool, Sith. I'll destroy you.
16269 := What? But I passed your test!
16270 := You two were pathetically easy to turn on each other.
16271 := You didn't think I actually wanted to be a Sith, did you?
16272 := Oh. That must be the poison kicking in, finally.
16273 := I did what I had to to wipe your kind of evil from the galaxy!
16274 := You are as evil and twisted as Malak. You Sith deserve to die!
16275 := My mission is to recover the Star Map, not become a Sith.
16276 := That's the idea! Time to die, scum!
16277 := Never? I'm hurt by that. Really, I am.
16278 := I got what I came here for. The Star Map.
16279 := Speak with Master Uthar; he will give you the final test.
16280 := Go and retrieve the lightsaber. There is nothing we can do for you until then.
16281 := Do not speak to me now! Kill him!!
16282 := Uthar is finished, and a new order is brought to the academy. Excellent.
16283 := Unfortunately for you, I don't intend to share power. It's time for you to die.
16284 := While I do like you... truly... I'm afraid I'm not the type to share power with anyone. Even you.
16285 := Then you should have no trouble defending yourself. For what it's worth.
16286 := I... I did tell you there was no such thing as friends among the Sith, didn't I? Let's get this over with.
16287 := I... I'm sure. I told you there was no such thing as friends among the Sith, didn't I? Let's... get this over with.
16288 := As if I would ever believe that! Defend yourself, if you dare!
16289 := If only I could believe you. Let's... get this over with. Quickly.
16290 := Unfortunately, I don't need... I don't...
16291 := ...unghh! The pain! My blood is burning!!
16292 := D-damn you! You will never be a Sith, now! I... I will destroy you for this! You... you will not leave here alive!!
16293 := ...unghh! The pain! I... why did you do this to me? I thought...
16294 := D-damn you! I... I will destroy you for this! You... you will never leave here alive!!
16295 := Unghhh! Stop! I... I yield!
16296 := You are... too strong for me. Gather your hatred and strike me down... if that is your will.
16297 := As I thought. You are no Sith. A real Sith would have no hesitation in striking me down.
16298 := Mercy? You truly don't belong here, then. I hope you got whatever it was you came to the academy for.
16299 := I... was right the first time, back at the cantina, wasn't I? There is something strange about you... more so than I even suspected.
16300 := Your path leads elsewhere, to a destiny I can only guess at. Whatever it is does not involve joining the Sith... not yet, at least.
16301 := Go, then. Go and leave here... I'll not stop you.
16302 := Then I hope you got what you came to the academy for, whatever that was.
16303 := You are... too strong for me. I was a fool to think otherwise. I am... at your mercy.
16304 := I... suppose I am. Something tells me that you are... not like the other students. I don't know why that is.
16305 := I... was right the first time, back at the cantina, wasn't I? There is something different about you... more so than I even suspected.
16306 := I see. I should have known... right from the beginning. But you are no longer the Dark Lord you once were, are you?
16307 := You are Revan... but yet you are not. What I sense of your destiny is... is still unclear.
16308 := That alone makes you different. Most of the Sith here... would not think twice about it.
16309 := I didn't think you were here to train. Not really. I should have realized that sooner.
16310 := No, I don't suppose you can.
16311 := So what happens now? Will you show me mercy? Will you... just let me leave?
16312 := That's... tempting, but I don't think I could. Your path... it goes somewhere I can't follow.
16313 := [Failure] N-no... no, it's too late for me. Please... either let me go, or end it now.
16314 := [Success] I... suppose you could be right.
16315 := Very well. I... won't stop you, or mention what you've done here.
16316 := You have a destiny to fulfill, and that does not involve you joining the Sith... at least not yet. I won't keep you from it. May the Force serve you well.
16317 := You are too powerful. You would never be my second for long... if the academy even truly interested you.
16318 := I... I see. Then let us end this here.
16319 := I had no choice. You... reminded me too much of a time before I became a Sith. I... didn't want to think about that.
16320 := [Success] I... suppose you could be right.
16321 := All the things I wanted to do, all the wrongs I wanted to right... I haven't done any of it. They just get farther and farther from my mind.
16322 := All I've cared about is power and... and myself. This isn't the person I was.
16323 := You're right. Maybe... maybe what I needed most was peace, after all. The Jedi tried to show me that.
16324 := I don't know if I can ever go back to them... but my place isn't here. Thank you... thank you for showing me that.
16325 := You have a destiny, my friend, and I wish you well on your way to it. May the Force... be with you.
16326 := I... understand. May the Force serve you well.
16327 := Then it ends here.
16328 := I was going to kill you anyway, Sith. This makes it easy!
16329 := Typical. I knew this was coming.
16330 := Are you sure there's no way other than this?
16331 := But... I don't want any power!
16332 := Oh. That must be the poison kicking in, finally.
16333 := I did what I had to to to.
16334 := You made it too easy for me.
16335 := You were going to betray me. Don't think I don't know.
16336 := You thought wrong.
16337 := I have no use for you any longer.
16338 := You thought wrong. I will never be a Sith.
16339 := Sorry, Yuthura. This is the way it has to be.
16340 := Go on. Get out of here.
16341 := I can't do that. Just go.
16342 := I'm showing you mercy. Don't push it.
16343 := That's right. I am no Sith... and I am glad of it.
16344 := Good point. Time to die!!
16345 := I... have no other choice. I'm sorry.
16346 := I have no problem with that. Die!!
16347 := You ask for mercy? You, a Sith?
16348 := Indeed. I am Darth Revan.
16349 := I'm not all that different. I just don't want to kill you.
16350 := I'm not here to become a Sith. I got what I came for.
16351 := I can't talk about that.
16352 := You could come with me.
16353 := [Persuade] Maybe you need to think about your own path.
16354 := [Persuade] Maybe you need to think about your own path.
16355 := Go... before I change my mind.
16356 := Tell me why you tried to kill me, first.
16357 := I'm sorry, but I have to kill you now.
16358 := No, it never interested me. You were a fool... now you must die.
16359 := [Persuade] Maybe you *should* think about it.
16360 := There's still time to change that.
16361 := I can't do that. I'm sorry, but I have to kill you.
16362 := Mercy? You won't find any here!

16400 := You may be a droid, but when this is all over I'm going to see the Republic gives you a medal for your part in this!
16401 := Well done, Juhani. In freeing us from the cell you have proven yourself truly worthy of the title of Jedi.
16402 := Nice job, Canderous. You keep getting us out of jams like this and there might be a place for you in the Republic army, even if you are a Mandalorian!
16403 := Well done, Jolee. I knew we could count on you. A Jedi never fails to get the task done!
16404 := Good job, Mission! I knew you wouldn't let us down. When we get out of this I'm going to see you get a medal from the Republic for everything you've done!
16405 := If I remember the layout of this ship our equipment should be in a storage chamber just through the north doors. After we grab our stuff we need to get to the main bridge controls.
16406 := The bridge is the only place we can open the docking gates of the hangar where they've got the Ebon Hawk. We have to open those gates before we can fly out of here! 
16407 := We better get moving. I can feel the darkness of Malak's presence approaching, and I don't want to be here when he arrives. None of us is a match for the Sith Lord.
16408 := Surprise and secrecy will serve us best. A small group might have a better chance of sneaking onto the bridge undetected while the others make their way down to the Ebon Hawk.
16409 := Count me in, then. I've got a score to settle with the Admiral before we get off this ship, and I have a feeling I'm gonna find him on the Leviathan's bridge!
16410 := You better come with me and Carth. The others can find their way on their own, but we might run into trouble. We'll need you and your powerful Force abilities to deal with it.
16411 := That's true, Carth. You can come, but don't let your hatred of Saul Karath jeopardize our true mission: getting the Ebon Hawk safely off the Leviathan.
16412 := That's a good idea. The others can get to the Ebon Hawk on their own, but Carth and I might need your help.
16413 := The three of us will get our equipment and make our way to the bridge. The rest of you head down to the docking hangar where they've got the Ebon Hawk. You'll have to find a way to deal with guards.
16414 := Don't you worry about that. I know how to deal with the guards. They won't know what hit them! 
16415 := We'll meet you there as soon as we get those docking bay doors open. Just make sure the Hawk is ready to fly when we get there. And may the Force be with you.
16416 := Then you are a fool! The power of the Dark Lord is strong enough to destroy any of us... even you. It would be suicide to face Malak here! We need to get away before he arrives.
16417 := Don't try to move too quickly, you might not be fully recovered yet. Admiral Karath had his guards continue to torture you even after you passed out.
16418 := They tortured all of us, though you got the worst of it by far. Saul wanted them to make us suffer. He's become some sort of sadistic monster.
16419 := The dark side has perverted him, Carth. Once you start down the tainted path it leads you ever further into the depths of evil. I fear he is forever lost.
16420 := This is not a matter to joke about! If there is one thing we can learn from Saul it is how the power of the dark side can corrupt even the bravest of heroes!
16421 := I'm sorry. Forgive me. Snapping at you like that won't help our situation.
16422 := Yes, hmm, I suppose you are correct. Sometimes it is easy to lose sight of that hope in the face of such unbridled cruelty, but you speak the truth.
16423 := I suppose I'm taking the news of Dantooine's destruction quite hard. First Taris, now the Academy... is there no end to the killing?
16424 := I'd like to believe that Saul was lying to us, but even as he said the words I knew they were true. The Academy is gone.
16425 := We should have felt a disturbance in the Force when the attack came. The fact that we did not is a bad sign. I fear the dark side is growing stronger, casting shadows our vision cannot pierce.
16426 := I can only hope that some of the Jedi escaped. Vrook, Vandar, Zhar... I cannot imagine all of them being gone. In any case, we have lost our one place of refuge in the galaxy.
16427 := None of this will matter if we don't get out of this prison before Saul gets back!
16428 := Saul mentioned that Lord Malak was on his way. I think the Admiral left to prepare for his arrival... and to report the results of our interrogation.
16429 := It is fortunate you were able to resist the Admiral's questioning. The fate of the galaxy could be changed by revealing the slightest piece of vital information.
16430 := I, uh... I have to confess something. There was a... there was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping that you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.
16431 := You... you wanted me to suffer? You enjoyed my torment? I... I don't know what to say. I thought there was a... a bond between us.
16432 := Maybe you're not the woman I thought you were.
16433 := No, I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you had no other choice. You couldn't betray our cause.
16434 := I... I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that I... I might have cracked.
16435 := I have to confess something. There was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.
16436 := You wanted me to suffer? You enjoyed my torment? I don't know what to say. I thought there was a bond between us.
16437 := Maybe... maybe you're not the man I thought you were.
16438 := I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you did the right thing.
16439 := I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that... it might have been too much for me to bear.
16440 := I only wish you had been able to resist the Admiral's questioning. I hope the information you revealed does not bring the entire galaxy under the dominion of the Sith. 
16441 := Your attitude disturbs me. Such selfishness is a sign of the dark side's taint, and it does little to fill me with confidence in you.
16442 := Forget about it, Bastila. It doesn't matter anyway. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.
16443 := I've known Admiral Karath a long time and I think you're right.
16444 := The interrogation was a sham. Saul was toying with us. He didn't care what we told him. I think it was just an excuse to torture us before Malak arrived.
16445 := Did you feel that? A disturbance in the Force. The Admiral has sent his message, the Dark Lord knows we are here now. Malak is coming.
16446 := Well, then we better hope HK-47 busts us out of here before he arrives.
16447 := Well, then we better hope Juhani busts us out of here before he arrives.
16448 := Well, then we better hope Canderous busts us out of here before he arrives.
16449 := Well, then we better hope Jolee busts us out of here before he arrives.
16450 := Well, then we better hope T3-M4 busts us out of here before he arrives.
16451 := Well, then we better hope Mission busts us out of here before he arrives.
16452 := I appreciate your... feelings... for Carth. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.
16453 := I appreciate your... feelings... for me. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.
16454 := Your efforts were well intentioned but poorly thought out; Saul tortured us all anyway. There is too much at stake to let reckless passion rule our actions.
16455 := Don't be so hard on yourself. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.
16456 := I know if I had been in that position I would not have betrayed the Order and the Republic!
16457 := Stop it, both of you! Bastila, you... you can't honestly say how you would have reacted in that situation - nobody can! Besides, Saul already had all the information. I could tell. 
16458 := Let's get our equipment and blast our way to those bridge controls!
16459 := We need some type of plan.
16460 := I'll go with the others back to the Ebon Hawk.
16461 := Careful, Carth, there's more at stake here than personal revenge.
16462 := I'm coming, too!
16463 := I'm not afraid of Malak!
16464 := Blah, blah, blah. Don't you ever get tired of being so preachy?
16465 := No one is without hope of redemption, Bastila.
16466 := It's their own fault. They should have seen the attack coming.
16467 := I know... it's hard to believe they're all gone.
16468 := Maybe Admiral Karath was lying.
16469 := I'm not afraid of him!
16470 := Where is Saul Karath now?
16471 := The only reason I stayed silent was to watch you suffer.
16472 := I'm sorry, Carth. Watching you suffer tore me apart.
16473 := The only reason I stayed silent was to watch you suffer.
16474 := Saul would have tortured us no matter what I told him.
16475 := I'm sorry, Bastila. Watching you suffer tore me apart.
16476 := Why should I endure torture just to protect the Republic and the Jedi?
16477 := Saul already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.
16478 := I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let Carth be tortured!
16479 := I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let you be tortured!
16480 := I'm... I'm sorry I failed you. I didn't know what else to do.
16481 := How dare you judge me? You have no idea what it's like to be put into that kind of position!
16482 := No, you would have just left someone you care about screaming in agony!

16510 := This is Canderous. We're at the Ebon Hawk. Like we figured, it's under heavy guard. But don't worry... we'll figure out a plan to take care of them.
16511 := Admiral Karath taught me everything I know about being a soldier. He was a legend in the Republic fleet, and a hero to me. Until he betrayed us.
16512 := When the Sith attacked my home world, the Leviathan - which is Saul Karath's flagship - was at the head of the fleet. My family was destroyed that day and my wife died in the Sith bombardment.
16513 := That is not the way of the Jedi. Vengeance, anger, emotion: these things lead to the dark side!
16514 := I'm not going to do anything stupid. I won't throw our lives away in some mad quest for vengeance. But if I get a chance to kill Saul during our escape, nobody better get in my way.
16515 := Talk of an escape is somewhat premature, don't you think? We don't even have a plan to get out of this mess yet!
16516 := I'll admit it won't be easy. Saul's no fool and he won't underestimate us either. You can count on plenty of guards watching every move we make.
16517 := Maybe Admiral Karath doesn't know how many of us there are on board. We all have special talents; talents we could exploit so that one of us could stage a rescue.
16518 := We just have to figure out who has the best chance to avoid capture so that they can come and rescue us later. It's a long shot, but it's our only hope.
16519 := Well, if we're going to pick someone to save our skins we better do it quick. In another minute we're going to have Sith troops marching up our loading ramp!
16520 := Is that wise? We need someone inconspicuous for this task, and Wookiees tend to draw a lot of attention... especially from arresting troops. Maybe you should go with someone else.
16521 := Statement: My construction includes a reserve memory chip and back-up power supply that automatically kicks in if I have been shut down too long.
16522 := Deactivate my main circuits and wipe my memory chip. The Sith will take me to the junk heap and I can come rescue the rest of you after I re-activate.
16523 := Answer: That is possible. My reserve power supply is a prototype yet to be tested. Yet I can attempt this task, if you wish.
16524 := You speak the truth. I alone of all the group might be able to remain hidden if the Sith search the ship.
16525 := I could wait until the guards have completed their search, then come to rescue you.
16526 := I think you may be underestimating my abilities, but I will bow to your decision.
16527 := You could give me a shot to delay my healing mods from kicking in. A small incendiary grenade will leave burn marks that look like I was injured while making repairs to the ship.
16528 := Make my wounds bad enough and the Sith'll drag me off to the morgue or the medical facility to die. When my healing mods kick in I'll come save the rest of you.
16529 := I'll go into the Ebon Hawk's armory and give myself that shot right now. The plating on the doors back there will keep the rest of you safe from the grenade explosion.
16530 := I'm the best chance we've got, and everyone knows it. But you're the boss, so I'll bow to your authority. I still think it's best... unless you've come up with another plan.
16531 := I don't think I could use my Force powers to convince a whole squadron of troopers to let me go free, but maybe I can use it to get them to take me to a separate cell.
16532 := They'll probably only leave a single guard to watch over an old man like me. I could use the Force to convince the guard to set me free, then I could free the rest of you.
16533 := I've learned a few things in my time, kid. Don't underestimate the Force, for one. But it's your call. If you want to try a different plan, go ahead.
16534 := Beep. Beep. Boop.
16535 := Well, the droid's right. If we disable him the Sith will probably wipe his memory chips and take him to the junkpile.
16536 := But we can rig a back-up memory chip with a timer. When it kicks in the little fella will be reactivated and he can come find us.
16537 := Well, that's a risk we might have to take, unless you can come up with a better plan to get us out of this.
16538 := Maybe I can goad the guards into making a mistake! If I get them mad enough, they might put me in a separate cell to punish me.
16539 := With them focusing so much on you three I might be able to sneak out of my cell and come rescue the rest of you.
16540 := No, it's too dangerous!
16541 := It's a risk we have to take, Big Z. I can slice my way free from any security cell. Don't worry, I can pull this off! 
16542 := I won't let you down! You'll see!
16543 := Hold on! They're dragging us into the docking bridge!
16544 := The decision is yours - you're in charge. But I know I can do this if you give me a chance.
16545 := The admiral will be watching the three of us far too closely for any plot involving you, me or Carth to succeed. It's going to be up to one of the others to get us out of this.
16546 := This is your chance to avenge the deaths of your family!
16547 := Don't let your lust for revenge cloud your judgment, Carth.
16548 := Admiral Karath will be watching the three of us very closely. One of the others is going to have to save us.
16549 := This sounds like a job for a Wookiee!
16550 := A droid would have the best chance. HK-47 could come and rescue us.
16551 := Okay, we'll shut down HK-47 and hope his plan works.
16552 := What if the Sith disassemble you before your reserve power supply kicks in?
16553 := Okay, we'll give it a try.
16554 := Juhani, you can use your Force powers and camouflage abilities to avoid capture.
16555 := We'll try it your way, Juhani. May the Force be with you.
16556 := It's too much of a long shot; they'll find you. We need another plan.
16557 := Okay, Juhani. The fate of the crew is in your hands.
16558 := Canderous, is there some way we could exploit your healing ability?
16559 := Your plan is risky, but I don't see much choice.
16560 := You're not immortal, Canderous. Your injuries could kill you before your healing has a chance to kick in.
16561 := Okay, Canderous, I'll give your plan a shot.
16562 := Maybe Jolee could use the Force to affect their minds.
16563 := Okay, Jolee, the fate of the crew is in your hands.
16564 := You're putting an awful lot of faith in your ability to alter minds, Jolee. I think we need a better plan.
16565 := Okay, Jolee, you've convinced me. We'll go with your plan.
16566 := T3-M4 is a pretty resourceful little guy. He could pull this off.
16567 := Let's do it.
16568 := I'm afraid the Sith will melt him down before his back-up chip kicks in.
16569 := Okay, we'll rig up a spare memory chip and go with T3-M4.
16570 := Mission can do it. No prison can hold her!
16571 := This could work, and it's not like we have much choice.
16572 := If you make the Sith mad they might just decide to kill you. I don't like this plan.
16573 := Okay, Mission, I'll give you a chance.
16574 := Carth knows Saul the best. He can get us out of this.
16575 := Bastila, is there some way you could use your Battle Meditation here?
16576 := Don't worry, I can get away from Admiral Karath's guards.
16577 := Don't do anything you'll regret, Carth.

16587 := What do you want, old man? You better not be trying to cause any trouble or you'll be sorry! 
16588 := This cell is too drafty. My old bones could catch a chill in here. We don't want that. You better let me out.
16589 := Uh... yes. It's too drafty in there. Your old bones might catch a chill. We don't want that. Get out of there.
16590 := You shouldn't have let me out, sonny. That was wrong. Admiral Karath won't be too happy with you disobeying his orders.
16591 := Yes... what I did was wrong. Very wrong.
16592 := You deserve to be locked up in the cell for disobeying orders.
16593 := Yes... I deserve to be locked up for disobeying orders.
16594 := Huh? What... what just happened? What am I doing in here? Damn you, old man! I'll kill you if I ever get out of here!
16595 := Then I'll be sure to never let you out. Goodbye, sonny.
16596 := Come on, girlie. Into the cell. Let's go, I haven't got all day to waste on you. I need to get back to my post.
16597 := Quit crowding me! Sheesh, I've met Gamorreans who didn't smell as bad as you Sith.
16598 := You think you're pretty funny, don't you? But you're only making things worse for yourself.
16599 := How come every time you open your mouth to talk the scent of rancor dung comes out?
16600 := Maybe a little time in solitary confinement will teach you the proper respect for the Sith! Now, get into that cell!
16601 := Who designed those Sith uniforms anyway? A blind Rodian with a sick sense of humor?
16602 := That's funny. You should tell that one to the torturer when he comes to deal with you. 
16603 := What? You're... you're going to torture me?
16604 := No snappy comeback this time? The thought of torture scares you, hmm? Well, it should! The Sith have ways to inflict pain you can't even imagine.
16605 := It may be a few hours before your torture begins; we're busy interrogating your friends right now. Hey, I know! You could use this time to think up witty ways to beg for mercy. Ha! Ha!
16606 := Or I could use the keycard I lifted from your pocket to slice into the security panel and get myself out of this cell.
16607 := Piece of cake! I wonder when people will stop underestimating me?
16608 := You come back! You set me free now? Together we kill lots of Sith, yes? We die fighting, yes? We die with honor!
16609 := You not Sith. You escape prison? Let me out, I help you. Together we kill lots of Sith! We die fighting, yes? We die with honor!
16610 := Hurry, hurry. Find way to get me out. I kill lots of Sith when cage opens, like my brothers. I die in a sea of red Sith blood! Yes - I die with honor!
16611 := Reward? No reward. Nothing. Sith took everything. Only reward be honor we get in death. We die fighting Sith, like my brothers. Not caged like animal!
16612 := Why Sith put me in cell if I not enemy of Sith? You enemy of Sith, I enemy of Sith. Enemy of enemy is friend, yes? Let me out and we kill lots of Sith! We die fighting, we die with honor!
16613 := No, never get out alive. Even if you have ship to fly away, you not leave Leviathan. Ship not get past shields. Shields keep you in. No hope of escape from here.
16614 := Only hope is to die with honor, like my brothers. Only wish is to die spilling Sith blood, like my brothers. Now you give me that chance. Let me out, I help you!
16615 := I be smuggler. I work with my two brothers. One day Sith catch us smuggling. They board our ship, kill my brothers. Only I am captured.
16616 := My brothers die with honor, they die fighting Sith. I will die with shame at execution. Rather die fighting! But if you let me out now, I help you!
16617 := Yes, bloodlust to kill Sith! You not leave me here caged like animal! Open cage! Let me die fighting Sith! Let me die with honor like my brothers!
16618 := We kill Sith now, yes? Kill lots of Sith before they kill us, yes? We die soon, but we die with honor. We avenge my brothers, yes?
16619 := Death to Sith!
16620 := No, never get out alive. We die now. We die fighting Sith, like my brothers. We die with honor!
16621 := I'll see if I can figure out a way to set you free.
16622 := What kind of reward will you give me if I set you free?
16623 := How do I know I can trust you?
16624 := This isn't a suicide mission. I plan on getting out of here alive!
16625 := Who are you? Why did the Sith lock you in this cell?
16626 := You're mad with bloodlust! I'm not letting you out of there!
16627 := Yes, go kill all the Sith you find! Die with honor.
16628 := This isn't a suicide mission. I plan on getting out of here alive!
16629 := Carth, it has been far too long since we last spoke. I see the recent months have not been kind in your case. I barely recognized you.
16630 := But I recognized you, Saul. I see your face every night even as I promise myself I will kill you for what you did to my home world.
16631 := Did you learn nothing in your time under me? As a soldier you should understand that casualties were unavoidable. This was an act of war.
16632 := It was a cowardly act of betrayal! Your fleet bombed a civilian target into oblivion without warning or provocation. And the blood of those innocent people is on your hands!
16633 := In war even the innocent must die. The Sith would not accept me until I proved I had truly turned my back on the Republic by bombing the planet.
16634 := My wife died in that attack, Saul. And for that, I swear I'll kill you.
16635 := You used to be a man of action, not of empty words. Cling to your lust for revenge if you must, but spare me your tired threats. I've heard them all before.
16636 := You are an insignificant part of these events, anyway. Lord Malak is far more interested in your Jedi companions. He has great plans for them.
16637 := We will never serve Malak or the dark side! The Sith will be destroyed, Admiral Karath... as will you if you don't turn away from this path.
16638 := Your words are brave, Bastila, but the lure of the dark side is hard to resist - or so I've been told. I wonder if your companion is as devoted to the light as you are?
16639 := Your loyalty is as fickle as ever, I see. Malak will find that amusing, though I seriously doubt he will want you of all people at his side.
16640 := You're defiant. I'm certain Malak will find your loyalty to the Jedi amusing.
16641 := The Dark Lord would probably reward me if I just killed you once and for all. But he may want to question you given the trouble you've caused him... and the history between you.
16642 := The Dark Lord will no doubt torture you for information and for his own twisted pleasure. Eventually you will tell him everything. The Sith can be very persuasive.
16643 := However, Lord Malak is in another sector. It may be some time before he arrives, so I suppose I will have to fill in for him until then. Activate the torture fields.
16644 := Enough! I don't want them to pass out before I question them. Malak will appreciate any information I can give him when he arrives.
16645 := Don't waste your breath, Saul! We won't answer any of your questions.
16646 := Don't waste your breath, Saul! We won't answer any of your questions.
16647 := I'm sure you won't. However, we both know your friend's loyalties have proven in the past to be somewhat... flexible.
16648 := What are you saying? Physical pain is... is nothing compared to the suffering of the galaxy if Malak should defeat the Jedi!
16649 := What are you saying? Physical pain is nothing compared to the suffering of the galaxy if Malak should defeat the Jedi!
16650 := I am interrogating you, not the other way around. You will answer questions, not ask them.
16651 := It is time to put your loyalty to the test. I doubt torturing you will gain me your true cooperation. Your will is too strong to be broken that way.
16652 := However, even the strongest of heroes has trouble watching those they care about suffering.
16653 := The interrogation will begin now. Each time you refuse to answer or give me a false answer, Carth will suffer.
16654 := My pain is meaningless! Tell him nothing!
16655 := The interrogation will begin now. Each time you refuse to answer or give me a false answer, Bastila will suffer.
16656 := You expect me to fall for such a transparent ploy. You travel half way across the galaxy with someone and you expect me to believe you feel nothing for each other?
16657 := I tire of these games - now I want answers! On what planet is the Jedi Academy at which you were trained?
16658 := No! Don't say anymore!
16659 := No! Don't say anymore!
16660 := An excellent beginning. I am glad you are being reasonable.
16661 := This first question was a test. Obviously Malak knew the Academy was on Dantooine, and it has since been destroyed by our fleet!
16662 := Dantooine is an empty graveyard now. Nothing remains but a smoking ruin and the charred remains of your former Masters!
16663 := A brave front, but your feigned indifference does not fool me. Your masters are eradicated, along with any hope of someone rescuing you! 
16664 := Now... tell me your mission. How were the Jedi planning on using you to stop Lord Malak and our Sith armada?
16665 := Why? Why... why are telling him this?
16666 := You should be grateful, Carth. She is sparing you agony beyond comprehension.
16667 := Words that betray the Republic bring me more pain than any torture ever could!
16668 := Why? Why are you telling him this?
16669 := You should be grateful, Bastila. He is sparing you agony beyond comprehension.
16670 := Words that betray the Jedi Order bring me more pain than any torture ever could!
16671 := Tell me, how did you find out about the Star Forge?
16672 := No! How could you betray the Republic like this?
16673 := I find your willingness to cooperate pleasing, though it seems your answers are quite upsetting to Carth. Not to worry, we are almost finished here.
16674 := No! How could you betray the Jedi like this?
16675 := I find your willingness to cooperate pleasing, though it seems your answers are quite upsetting to Bastila. Not to worry - we are almost finished here.
16676 := The information you have given me has been most useful, but I fear our session is over. Lord Malak will want to continue with this line of questioning himself.
16677 := [Failure] A diary? This is not the time for jokes! I will only ask you one more time: How did you find out about the Star Forge?
16678 := For the sake of the Republic don't tell him anything!
16679 := Don't listen to him! Tell me what I want to know or watch Carth suffer!
16680 := For the sake of the Republic don't tell him anything!
16681 := Don't listen to her. Tell me what I want to know or watch Bastila suffer!
16682 := I had hoped you would continue to cooperate, but you seem to have changed your position.
16683 := [Failure] Do you take me for a fool? The Jedi are not assassins - they would never devise such a plan!
16684 := Perhaps you need a reminder of the consequences of refusing to cooperate.
16685 := NO! AHHH!! The pain - THE PAIN! AHHHH!!!
16686 := Listen, can you not hear him suffering? You can spare him further pain by simply answering my questions.
16687 := NO! AHHH!! NO!! AUGH! The pain - THE PAIN! AHHHH!!! AUGH!
16688 := Listen, can you not hear her suffering? You can spare her further pain by simply answering my questions.
16689 := Now, I will ask again - on what mission did the Jedi Council send you?
16690 := Perhaps another lesson is in order?
16691 := No! AHHH!!! AUGH! NO!!! I beg you... mercy!!! NO!!!
16692 := I am surprised he did not pass out sooner. Rarely have I seen someone withstand such punishment and remain conscious.
16693 := No! AHHH!!! AUGH! NO!!! I beg you... No! Mercy!!! NO!!! AUGH!
16694 := I am surprised she did not pass out sooner. Rarely have I seen someone withstand such punishment and remain conscious. 
16695 := I see I am wasting my time here. When Malak arrives you will learn my interrogation techniques are considered merciful among the Sith.
16696 := I will leave you here in your cell with a small taste of the horrors you will suffer when Lord Malak arrives.
16697 := More empty threats. We Sith prefer to let our actions speak for us. Perhaps that is why we are winning this war.
16698 := It doesn't matter whether you believe me or not. The fact remains that the Jedi on Dantooine have been eradicated, along with any hope of someone coming to rescue you!
16699 := [Failure] Alderaan is nothing but a planet of artisans and philosophers! There is no training academy there! You must think this is a game.
16700 := Very well. This is the price of your resistance.
16701 := AHHHH!!!
16702 := AHHHH!!
16703 := Enough! You see what happens when you try to defy me?
16704 := My pain is meaningless. Tell him nothing!
16705 := You mean... oh, this can't be true, can it? You really don't know what's going on here, do you? Well, I won't be the one to deprive Malak of the pleasure of telling you himself.
16706 := For the right offer I could probably be convinced to join the Sith.
16707 := You're wasting your time, Saul. I'll never betray the Jedi!
16708 := Why don't you just let me go? Bastila is the one you want.
16709 := Malak won't get any answers from me!
16710 := Don't torture me. I'll tell you everything you want to know.
16711 := What are you talking about?
16712 := My loyalty is as true as Bastila's!
16713 := Go ahead, torture him. I don't really like him anyway.
16714 := I will not betray the Jedi, even to save Carth.
16715 := Don't hurt him, I beg you!
16716 := Go ahead, torture her. I don't really like her anyway.
16717 := They're on Dantooine.
16718 := I never liked them anyway.
16719 := We were searching for the Star Forge.
16720 := Bastila and I saw Revan and Malak searching for it in our dreams.
16721 := [Persuade/Lie] I found Malak's diary.
16722 := No, I will tell you nothing more!
16723 := [Persuade/Lie] We have been sent to assassinate Lord Malak.
16724 := This accomplishes nothing, Saul. We will never betray the Republic.
16725 := You are a sick and evil man, Saul Karath.
16726 := I won't betray the Jedi.
16727 := You will pay for this crime, Saul! You and all the Sith!
16728 := No, you're lying! It isn't true!
16729 := [Persuade/Lie] Alderaan. It's on Alderaan.
16730 := Jedi Academy? I have no idea what you're talking about.
16731 := I will not betray the Jedi Order, even to save Bastila.
16732 := Don't hurt her, I beg you.
16733 := My loyalty is as true as Carth's!
16734 := History? What are you talking about?
16735 := Bastila, Carth and the crew have been taken prisoner as you ordered, commander!
16736 := Excellent. Have you searched the ship thoroughly? Admiral Karath warned me to be on alert for any kind of treachery.
16737 := We found a disabled hunter-killer droid in the back of the ship.
16738 := Excellent. We can reprogram this droid to fight in our own army. Wipe its memory chip and take it to the salvage shop. The technicians will deal with it later.
16739 := We searched the ship from top to bottom. Somebody would have had to be invisible for us not to find them in there. 
16740 := Well done. Return to your posts, and I will tell the Admiral of this.
16741 := We found an injured Mandalorian in the back. Looks like he was trying to rig the ship's engines to break free of our tractor beam when something exploded.
16742 := Admiral Karath wants us to question all the prisoners. Did you get any information from him?
16743 := He's unconscious right now. I don't think he's going to make it. He's burned pretty bad.
16744 := Dump the Mandalorian in the medical bay. Let them take the blame if he dies before the Admiral has a chance to interrogate him.
16745 := We found an old man in the back. I... I think we should keep him separate from the others. For questioning.
16746 := A strange request. And why do you think this old man should be segregated?
16747 := I... I'm not sure, Commander. After speaking with him I just... I just think we should question him away from the others.
16748 := I... I agree, Commander. After speaking with the old man I think we should question him away from the others.
16749 := Very well. The Admiral is probably too busy to bother with this old man anyway. Take him to solitary confinement for interrogation. Report back to me if you learn anything.
16750 := We found a disabled astromech droid in the back of the ship.
16751 := Wipe its memory chips and take it to the junk pile. Maybe we can use some of its parts for salvage.
16752 := We found a young Twi'lek in the back. She's got quite the mouth on her! She swore at me and spit on my uniform.
16753 := She tried to bite me through my armor! And you should hear what she said about my mother. Admiral Karath needs to teach her the proper respect for the Sith!
16754 := The Admiral doesn't have time to bother with some Twi'lek girl! Take her away to solitary confinement. I'll leave it up to you to teach her the proper respect for the Sith!

16936 := Don't shoot! Only the guards were armed, I don't have any weapons! I'm injured! I surrender! I surrender!
16937 := I'm Major Hurka of the Sith's Second battalion. Most of my unit was sacrificed for the sake of better strategic position in the last land battle against the Republic.
16938 := Luckily only my arm was injured in the attack; I could still make a break for it when we were overrun. Because I'm an officer I was taken here to the medical bay for treatment.
16939 := Of course Lord Malak ordered that any enlisted Sith soldiers fleeing the battle be gunned down for desertion. I feel bad for my troops, but you've got to maintain discipline.
16940 := Help! Guards! The prisoners have escaped!
16941 := You don't have to kill me! Just... just give me a shot of kolto! That'll knock me out for hours! Please, I don't want to die like this - injured and helpless on a hospital bed!
16942 := Wow! That's powerful stuff. I'm ... getting... dizzy... already...
16943 := You may have escaped your cell, but you'll never make it off the Leviathan. Your ship's locked up in the docking bay and only the main bridge computer can open the bay doors.
16944 := But you'll never make it to the bridge. Too much security. There's droids, soldiers and gun turrets. Anyone not accompanied by a Sith officer will be attacked on sight!
16945 := Not unless you can breathe in outer space. The only corridor on the ship leading to the bridge goes right through the security station. You'll never make it.
16946 := Why would I want to help you? You're the enemy!
16947 := No, don't torture me! I'll do what you want!
16948 := [Failure] If I help you Admiral Karath will kill me himself... after torturing me for days first! Believe me - I'm more scared of him than I am of you!
16949 := [Success] If Admiral Karath finds out I helped you I'm dead... but I guess it's better than having you kill me now. I just hope no one ever finds out what I've done.
16950 := I'll get you past the bridge security station, but I think your plan is going to get us both killed! 
16951 := Okay, I've punched in my security clearance. The doors are unlocked and you don't have to worry about the droids or the gun turrets in the next room.
16952 := But in the next room there's half a dozen guards. I don't know how you plan to get past them.
16953 := I knew you couldn't be trusted! Guards! Help! The prisoners have escaped!
16954 := This is madness! It'll never work! The guards will see me with you. They'll tell Admiral Karath I was helping you. He'll have me flayed alive!
16955 := I should never have agreed to this! You've signed my death warrant!
16956 := [Success] Yes... you're my friend. I want to help you. Come on, follow me. I'll take you past the security station.
16957 := There you go, friend. I've unlocked the door and disabled the droids and gun turrets and... uh... and... wait a minute! What's going on here?
16958 := You used some kind of Jedi mind trick on me, didn't you?
16959 := The Republic is soft. They don't even torture prisoners, let alone kill their own troops. That's why we Sith are winning so many of the battles. 
16960 := The fear of Lord Malak keeps the troops in line. It makes my job as an officer easier, too. Nobody ever questions any of my orders.
16961 := What are you doing here?
16962 := Injured or not, you're a Sith soldier. You deserve death!
16963 := If I leave you here you'll set off the alarm as soon as I'm gone.
16964 := Okay, I'll use the medical bed to administer a shot of kolto.
16965 := I'm getting off this ship... and you're going to help me!
16966 := There has to be another way to get onto the bridge!
16967 := You're a Sith Officer. You could get me past the security station.
16968 := [Persuade] Good, I'm glad you won't talk. Now I have an excuse to torture you!
16969 := [Persuade] You're not really in a position to refuse me.
16970 := That's not your concern... since I'm going to kill you now!
16971 := I'll just blast my way past. Come on.
16972 := You can get us past the guards. Come on.
16973 := [Dominate Mind] I'm not the enemy. I'm your friend. You want to help me.
16974 := Kill anyone who doesn't follow orders. I like that attitude.
16975 := How could you kill your own troops? You're a monster!
16976 := Who are you?
16977 := Carth... Carth....
16978 := The Admiral, he's still alive!
16979 := It's time to finish this.
16980 := No, Carth, not like this! Do not give in to the hate.
16981 := Don't you understand what this man has done to my life? Do you know the pain he's brought me?
16982 := Killing him won't ease the pain, Carth. Do not become what you despise.
16983 := Carth... *cough*... must tell you... *cough* must tell you something... *cough, cough*... come closer....
16984 := [Unintelligible Whisper] You didn't know, did you? *cough* Ha-ha-ha.
16985 := Remember my dying words. *cough* Remember them whenever *cough*... whenever you look at those you thought were your friends!
16986 := He's gone. He said... it can't be true, can it? No. No... no - it can't! Damn you, Saul! Damn you!
16987 := Bastila - it is true, isn't it? And... and you knew! You and the whole damn Jedi Council. You knew the whole time!
16988 := Carth, it's not what you think. We had no other choice! Please, you don't understand...
16989 := So make me understand!
16990 := Not here, Carth. Please... there's no time. Malak is coming. This isn't the place.
16991 := Please, Carth, I'm asking you to trust me. For just a little while longer.
16992 := I'll trust you, Bastila but as soon as we're off this ship I expect some answers!
16993 := Of course, Carth. As soon as we get to the Ebon Hawk I'll explain everything. To both of you. I promise.
16994 := Very resourceful. I assume you had some part in this; you learned your lessons well from me.
16995 := The only thing you taught me was betrayal and death, Saul.
16996 := Don't be a fool. I am giving you and your companions a chance to surrender. A chance to live. Darth Malak himself is on his way, he will be arriving any moment.
16997 := He speaks the truth, Carth. I can feel the Dark Lord's presence approaching.
16998 := Malak will destroy you, but if you throw down your weapons now I will ask my Master to be merciful.
16999 := I've seen enough of Sith mercy!
17000 := You always did like to do things the hard way. Lord Malak would have preferred live prisoners, but corpses will have to do.
17001 := Take your time, Carth. Make him suffer for what he's done to you!
17002 := Okay, he's dead, your family's avenged. Can we get out of here now?
17003 := Forget it, Carth. Whatever he said he was only trying to hurt you.
17004 := What did he say, Carth?
17005 := Forget him, Carth, we have to get out of here before Malak arrives!
17006 := No, Carth, don't give in to your hatred!

17060 := This isn't over, Malak!
17061 := Your friends do not give up easily, Revan; you always could inspire loyalty. But even the three of you together cannot stand against my power!
17062 := I'll hold Malak off. You two get out of here! Find the Star Forge!
17063 := No, Bastila, he's too strong!
17064 := For the Jedi!
17065 := NO!!
17066 := The door's sealed, we can't get past! Come on, we have to get to the Ebon Hawk!
17067 := Bastila doesn't stand a chance against Malak, but we can't help her. Not here. We have to get off this ship and find the Star Forge. That's the key to beating the Dark Lord! 
17068 := Bastila sacrificed herself so we could get away. We can't let her sacrifice be in vain! Come on!
17069 := Good idea. Let Bastila deal with Malak.
17070 := What about Bastila? We have to help her!
17071 := You cannot hide from what you once were, Revan! Recognize that you were once the Dark Lord - and know that I have taken your place!
17072 := You do not yet remember, Revan? The Jedi set a trap. They lured us into battle against a small Republic fleet. During the attack a team of Jedi knights boarded your ship.
17073 := The Jedi strike team captured you and the Council used the Force to reprogram your mind; they wiped away your identity and turned you against your own followers.
17074 := The Jedi are fools; they do not believe in executing prisoners. Originally I assumed you had died in the battle. Imagine my surprise when I found out you were still alive, Revan.
17075 := Once I served you, Revan, but I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.
17076 := I ordered my own ships to fire on your bridge. I thought I could destroy all my enemies with a single glorious victory! I never dreamed the Jedi would take you alive from the wreckage.
17077 := You mean why did I betray you, Revan. You are the one who taught me the ways of the Sith: the strongest must rule if we are to survive!
17078 := You knew I would one day challenge you for supremacy, but you underestimated me. I acted sooner than you expected and seized the Sith throne with a single brilliant stroke!
17079 := I helped them, Revan. I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.
17080 := You must have seen flashes of your old life in your dreams, Revan; memories bubbling up to the surface? Surely you must remember the battle in which you were captured?
17081 := How you survived the final battle is a mystery to me. Perhaps you should ask Bastila; after all, she was part of the Jedi strike team that captured you!
17082 := It's true. I was part of the team sent to capture Revan... to capture you. When Malak fired on the ship you were badly injured. We thought you were dead.
17083 := Your mind was destroyed, but I used the Force to preserve the flicker of life in your body. I brought you to the Jedi Council. They were the ones who healed your damaged mind.
17084 := The Jedi Council didn't restore your wounded mind, Revan! They merely programmed it with a new identity - one loyal to the Republic! They tried to make you their slave!
17085 := Forgiveness, Revan? You are weak; I was right to betray you. You are not fit to rule the Sith!
17086 := A small part of me has always regretted betraying you from afar. I always knew there were some who would think I acted out of fear, that I did not want to face you.
17087 := But now fate has given me a second chance to prove myself. Once I defeat you in combat no one will question my claim to the Sith throne; my triumph will be complete!
17088 := The Jedi Council were foolish to let you live. I won't make the same mistake. We shall finish this alone in the ancient Sith tradition: master versus apprentice, as it was meant to be!
17089 := We couldn't simply restore your true identity; Revan was too dangerous. But locked inside your mind was information the Republic needed: the secrets of the Star Forge.
17090 := The Council created an identity for you: a soldier under my command. Your subconscious memories were supposed to lead me to the Star Forge; there was no other way to get the information.
17091 := They made you their puppet, Revan - and Bastila was the handler pulling your strings!
17092 := That was a risk the Council chose to take. I had to try and draw out the secrets of the Star Forge. It was our only hope of stopping the Sith! There was no other choice.
17093 := I used my Force powers to heal you on that bridge; we share a bond. I convinced the Council I could use our bond to draw out your memories and lead us to the Star Forge.
17094 := Tell the truth, Bastila, you wanted to taste the dark side for yourself! You knew the only way the Council would permit you to explore the Sith's power was through Revan's lost memories!
17095 := NO! I... I wanted to help you, Revan. I thought this mission would redeem you, that it would atone for your past crimes. How else could you be saved?
17096 := When I used my Force powers to keep you alive on that bridge it created our bond. I convinced the Council that I could use that bond to draw out your memories and lead us to the Star Forge.
17097 := Tell the truth, Bastila, you wanted to taste the dark side for yourself! You knew the only way the Council would permit you to explore the Sith's power was through Revan's lost memories!
17098 := NO! I wanted to help you, Revan. I thought this mission would redeem you; that it would atone for your past crimes. How else could you be saved?
17099 := You had to be healed so I could try and draw out the secrets of the Star Forge - it was our only hope of stopping the Sith! It was a risk the Council chose to take.
17100 := The Jedi hold all life sacred, even that of a Sith Lord. I could not just let you die, Revan. Not if it was possible to save you.
17101 := Bastila hides the truth behind noble words, Revan! The Jedi needed the memories buried deep in your wounded mind; there was no other way to bring them out. They had to keep you alive!
17102 := I wanted to tell you, but the Council forbid it! They were afraid you might return to the dark side if you discovered your real identity!
17103 := But now you know the truth, Revan! The Council has failed in their attempt to make you their pawn! The will of a Sith Lord is not so easily manipulated!
17104 := How can you say that? Malak nearly killed you, but the Jedi Council gave you another chance to live! They gave you a chance to redeem yourself by defeating the Sith!
17105 := A rash and futile hope. The dark side is too strong, my power is too great! Even my old master is no longer a match for me!
17106 :=  
17107 := Darth Malak!
17108 := I hope you weren't thinking of leaving so soon, Bastila. I've spent far too much energy hunting down you and your companions to let you get away from me now.
17109 := Besides, I had to see for myself if it was true. Even now I can hardly believe my eyes... tell me, why did the Jedi spare you? Is it vengeance you seek at this reunion?
17110 := As is the outcome. I am actually surprised this confrontation did not happen sooner, given how powerful your mind once was.
17111 := What? Ha-ha-ha! You mean you don't know? Ha-ha-ha! All this time, and you still haven't figured it out? Ha-ha-ha!
17112 := I wonder how long you would have stayed blind to the truth? Surely some of what you once were must have surfaced by now.
17113 := Even the combined power of the Jedi Council couldn't keep your true identity buried forever, could it?
17114 := I'm... Darth Revan? How is that possible?
17115 := No... this is some type of trick! A Sith lie!
17116 := Why wouldn't the Jedi simply kill me?
17117 := Do you mean I'm really... your Master?
17118 := But why did you betray... your master?
17119 := How did they capture someone as powerful as Revan... I mean, me?
17120 := No, I don't believe you, Malak!
17121 := Yes - I've seen Bastila in my visions! She was there!
17122 := Bastila, is this true?
17123 := But the memories I have... where did they come from?
17124 := Then why don't I remember being Revan?
17125 := I understand, Bastila. You had no other choice.
17126 := Triumph, Malak? You seem to forget that I'm still alive!
17127 := Your power is no match for the light!
17128 := But why program me with another identity?
17129 := But what if I remembered who I really was?
17130 := Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?
17131 := Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?
17132 := But what if I remembered who I really was?
17133 := Why not just let me die?
17134 := You've been lying to me this whole time, Bastila!
17135 := You used me, Bastila! You're no better than the Sith!
17136 := This meeting was inevitable, Malak!
17137 := Why did the Jedi spare me? I don't understand...

17186 := (You find 10 credits and an access card for the Sith Base.)
17187 := You find nothing of value.
17188 := (snort, gurgle) Lemme shleep... (burp, snort)... (snore)
17189 := Well, shir... I fear I am good and truly drunk. Don't you be takin' advantage of me now, hear? Shay... you're handshome. You ain't married, are you? (hic) 
17190 := Sheems like all the good ones are married... (hic!) Oh, 'schuse me - that's not very ladylike, ish it?
17191 := Who knows? Who cares? Those Selkath punks are crawling around our embassy, making the whole place stink like fish!
17192 := Shunry... he's gettin' what he desherves! We Shith will make sure of that!
17193 := Jus' rumors. Shtuff I heard about making sure the shtupid fish people find the evidence they need..
17194 := I don't wanna talk about that shtuff. Shay, you never said if you was married...
17195 := Dunno what yer talkin' about... Mmmm, but you don't need a map to get what I can give ya!
17196 := Yesh! One more drink! Jus' what I wash thinking!
17197 := You're new around here, aren't you. My name's Duan. Care to buy a Sith girl a drink? That is, unless you're one of those simpering Republic soldiers. 
17198 := Oh... I get it. I get a little bit wild, and you want to hold it against me. 
17199 := Come on, what's the matter? Afraid I'll drink you under the table? Hey, if you're not man enough to keep up, who needs you?
17200 := Seems I'm not lady like enough for some men... well, I may be a woman, but I'm still a soldier! Barkeep, bring me another round!
17201 := We Sith are interested in a lot of things. If you're smart you'll stay out of Sith business.
17202 := What is there to investigate? Obviously Sunry is guilty. But the Republic is doing everything they can to keep him out of a Selkath prison.
17203 := You some kind of historian, or something? You should forget about the past and look towards the future. That's why I joined the Sith - the Republic is old news. And then I get stuck on Manaan, the worst post in the galaxy! 
17204 := It isn't easy here, you know. Not with all the Republic soldiers walking the streets while we sit and do nothing. Malak should send a fleet in and conquer this whole sector, kolto or no!
17205 := But I don't really want to talk about that right now. I'm just here to have a couple drinks and try to unwind, you know?
17206 := Sure, pull up a seat. I'll have the bartender ring us up a couple mugs of the local favorite. It's called a firaxian tooth.
17207 := Watch out for these - they pack quite the bite. Two or three of these babies and you won't even remember who you are.
17208 := Whoa - that's good stuff! Might even be better than Kessel spice, you think? Never touch the hard stuff.
17209 := I suppose there's no harm in that. It's the least I can do after you bought me a drink and all.
17210 := Aw, you want to talk business? I was hoping you wanted to ask something about me. Look, I don't want to talk shop. I just want to relax with my drink... which is, unfortunately, empty now.
17211 := I better take it easy - I've got a shift tomorrow and I don't want to end up passed out on the floor.
17212 := [Success] I suppose one more wouldn't hurt. As long as you're buying.
17213 := [Success] I suppose one more wouldn't hurt. As long as you're buying.
17214 := [Failure] I better not. You don't even want to know what the punishment is if we Sith show up drunk or hung-over for our shift.
17215 := [Success] I suppose one more wouldn't hurt. As long as you're buying.
17216 := Oh, that's good stuff. Really takes the edge off, know what I mean? Whoa, feeling a little light-headed, there. 
17217 := Firaxian tooth - almost as valuable as kolto, right? Ha ha ha! I gotta get this recipe someday. Wonder if I can brew it up right at home? What do you think is in this stuff, anyway? 
17218 := Sure, why not? You know, hardly anyone ever buys me drinks around this place. It's enough to make a woman doubt herself, you know?
17219 := I might be a little giddy, but I hope you don't think I'm going to start spilling Sith secrets all of a sudden. It'll take more than a couple drinks to get me there... but not much more! Ha ha ha!
17220 := I couldn't agree with you more. Just the sight of a Republic uniform makes me want to vomit. I can't wait until we crush them all like the pathetic vermin they are!
17221 := Sorry - I tend to get a little worked up. I think I've been stationed on Manaan too long. This place can make you crazy.
17222 := Some of the other soldiers like to go and bet on the swoops on their days off, but this planet is bad enough without mingling with the locals.
17223 := Look, lady - we Sith aren't here to make friends. So let me enjoy my drink in peace.
17224 := Rifle through Duan's wallet.
17225 := Hey, wake up! I need to ask you some questions.
17226 := Why are the Sith so interested in the Selkath youth?
17227 := Do you know anything about Sunry?
17228 := What are you talking about?
17229 := What do you know about a Star Map?
17230 := Maybe you need another drink.
17231 := I'll be going now.
17232 := I hear you Sith are taking an interest in the Selkath youth.
17233 := I'm investigating the recent murder of Elassa.
17234 := I'm searching for some ancient ruins, or maybe a long forgotten Star Map.
17235 := Can I join you? The next round's on me.
17236 := Mind if I ask you some questions?
17237 := Why are the Sith so interested in the Selkath youth?
17238 := Can you tell me about the recent murder?
17239 := Do you know about an ancient Star Map?
17240 := Want another one? My treat.
17241 := [Persuade] Don't worry, I'm a perfect gentleman. I'll make sure you get back to the embassy safe and sound. 
17242 := [Persuade] Just one more. It'll help you unwind.
17243 := [Force Persuade] Another one won't hurt.
17244 := Now you're relaxed. Want another one?
17245 := Mind if I ask you some questions now?
17246 := Let's get you one more round.
17247 := I don't have much use for the Republic.
17248 := I'm <FullName>. I'm just here to check out the swoop races.
17249 := You hiring for the Republic or the Sith?
17250 := Then why are you wasting my time? There's big money to be made here - I can't risk missing a job offer 'cause I'm yapping with you!
17251 := Neither.
17252 := My skills are not for hire right now. Perhaps the Mandalorian thug or the Iridorian savage on the other side of the bar are seeking employment - they are less discriminating than we Echani.
17253 := As you wish.
17254 := We Echani do hire our skills out, but the word mercenary has an unpleasant connotation for my people. We Echani are guided as much by honor as credits.
17255 := When the Republic called for aid to push back the Mandalorian aggression, we came without thought of reward. Against the Mandalore hordes we proved our worth.
17256 := The Republic knows we Echani are not as greedy as the Mandalorians, nor as blood thristy as the Iridorians. But recently their need for mercenaries on Manaan is so great they have been forced to hire whomever they can.
17257 := I do not know. The Republic has become very secretive as of late. I think they have something to hide. They hire my people, but will not say why - and those they hire do not return. 
17258 := Perhaps they have left the planet. Perhaps they are dead. I cannot say - and none of the Republic soldiers are talking.
17259 := The Mandalorians call themselves warriors - but they cower behind their heavy battle armor, and arm themselves with brutish weapons of mass destruction that require no skill or training to use! 
17260 := As for the Iridonians, they are blood-thirsty demons. They kill for pleasure, and leave a wake of savage violence and gruesome death. They have no nobility, no understanding of true honor. They are animals.
17261 := We Echani, however, are true warriors. We do not cower behind layers of armor and our chosen weapons are implements of precision and skill. We know honor and nobility.
17262 := I suppose I see no harm in that. Ask away.
17263 := Who'd be interested in those fish? I have no clue. Maybe Gonto over by the bar knows.
17264 := Ruins? On Manaan? There is nothing on Manaan but water, and the recently built Ahto City.
17265 := I cannot help you there. I have heard she was one of the Sith... perhaps the answers you seek are inside the Sith Embassy.
17266 := Is there anything else I can do for you?
17267 := Have you come here seeking refuge from the senseless atrocities of war, as I have?
17268 := The Sith have recently destroyed a Jedi enclave on Dantooine - did you know? I heard they bombed the planet from afar, just as they did Taris.
17269 := It seems in battle the Sith are as ruthless as the Iridorians and as craven as the Mandalorians.
17270 := Allow me to express my thanks. Though there has been no official statement from the Republic, I have learned you were the one responsible for discovering the fate of my fellow Echani.
17271 := The knowledge of their deaths saddens me, but now that their fate is known I can perform the appropriate funeral rites to honor our fallen.
17272 := Unlike the Mandalorians and Iridorians, we Echani remember those who have done us a service. Is there some small favor I may now do for you?
17273 := As long as this brutish oaf is with you, we have nothing to talk about.
17274 := I won't talk to you with that Mandalorian thug around!
17275 := We're wasting our time with this prancing Echani.
17276 := Brave words - but only a coward hides behind layers of armor, Mandalorian! A true Echani needs only his training and warrior spirit for protection!
17277 := Your protection didn't help much when my brothers slaughtered your warriors by the thousands during the Mandalorian Wars!
17278 := You are fortunate the Selkath neutrality laws stay my hand, else you would pay for those comments with your tongue, Mandalorian! 
17279 := See - I told you we were just wasting our time here.
17280 := What are you doing in my room?
17281 := Good - leave me to my privacy.
17282 := Don't be a fool. Since the murder, there are security cameras all over the place. If you do anything to me, the Selkath will lock you up for the rest of your life.
17283 := I am too tired to enter a discussion with you tonight. You can speak to me tomorrow at the mercenary enclave if you wish.
17284 := I'll be going now.
17285 := A mercenary who's not for hire? That's strange.
17286 := Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?
17287 := What do you have against the Mandalorians and Iridorians?
17288 := I just want to ask you some questions.
17289 := Never mind.
17290 := Why have the Sith shown such interest in young Selkath?
17291 := Do you know about a Star Map or ancient ruins?
17292 := Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?
17293 := Do you anything about the murder of Elassa?
17294 := I'll be going now.
17295 := Give me all your money!
17296 := I'm here to kill you!
17297 := I just want to talk.
17298 := Sunry's being held at the Selkath courts. They won't let anyone in to see him. Please, go to the courts, talk to the Judges. Maybe the Selkath will listen to you.
17299 := Don't worry, Elora. We'll get to the bottom of this and help Sunry... somehow.
17300 := I hear you have been appointed as Arbiter in Sunry's trial. My husband is innocent - please don't let him go to jail for a crime he didn't commit!
17301 := This is all a plot to discredit the Republic! Sunry is a victim of a Sith frame up!
17302 := It's possible. I haven't seen Sunry since I crashed on Kashyyyk... a man can change a lot in that time. The man I knew could never have done this crime, however.
17303 := Find the real evidence, that's all I ask. The real evidence will prove Sunry didn't do this.
17304 := Lies! It... it must be! I knew the Sith would never let a Republic hero get away... You must find Sunry innocent!
17305 := [Failure] What?? Don't insult us both! Sunry is... Sunry is a just and honorable man. How dare you accuse him... us, of such a thing!
17306 := Find proof to set him free instead of bringing these baseless accusations against us.
17307 := Madam. I would remind you that I am a Jedi. Now, then... was he having an affair?
17308 := Now, now, Elora. We're not here to pass judgment, my dear. We do need to know everything if we're to help, yes?
17309 := [Success] Of... of course not! He... he... *sob*
17310 := Yes... *sob* ...yes, he was having an affair. He was seeing that... that Sith woman.
17311 := After all these years we've been together he just... just dropped me like that. Not publicly, oh no, but inside that's what it feels like.
17312 := He started seeing Elassa last year. I... I had my suspicions for a while, but he was careless. Pretty soon everyone knew.
17313 := But... but... even though I'm sure that harlot was only using him, I know he couldn't have killed her. He came and confessed to the affair to me. He said he was going there to break it off - to end it.
17314 := Maybe the Sith woman attacked him and he had to defend himself?
17315 := But even though he cheated on me, inside he's still the man I loved... love... He is too kind and gentle to have killed her in cold blood.
17316 := That was a long time ago, in a war far, far away. He's changed now... settled down. Just please, prove his innocence.
17317 := Sunry is... he's a cripple. There's no way he could have overpowered this Sith woman like they claim.
17318 := And there's no way he would do something so dishonorable as hit her from behind. Sunry's a decorated war hero! He's a hero of the Republic!
17319 := That's true... I'd forgotten about that. Let's not forget that he would have had to have been considerably older than the Sith woman.
17320 := Hmph. I'm a Jedi... and one who was living alone in the Shadowlands until recently. That keeps you in shape, damn it! We're talking about Sunry, here.
17321 := Jolee! It *is* you! I... need your help.
17322 := Elora? Of all the people... How did you even know I'd left Kashyyyk?
17323 := I didn't. Nobody knew where you were, not even Sunry! But I heard the Selkath mention you and your friends. The Force has brought you to help us!
17324 := Why? Whatever could be the matter, my dear?
17325 := It's horrible, Jolee! Sunry has been arrested! The Sith have accused him of murder!
17326 := Murder? But how...
17327 := It's all a mistake, Jolee! Sunry isn't a murderer - someone is trying to frame him.
17328 := Calm down, Elora. Where's Sunry now?
17329 := Please, I beg you to bring Jolee to speak to me about my husband. Sunry's life depends on it!
17330 := I was told that you're a friend of Jolee Bindo... and that Jolee has returned to the sector. Please, I must speak to him. It's very urgent!
17331 := My name is Elora. My husband Sunry and Jolee are old friends. Now Sunry needs Jolee's help.
17332 := Someone is out to destroy my husband. I... I don't know who I can trust. I don't know you. But Jolee - he was always a true friend to Sunry.
17333 := Your husband might not be so innocent, Elora.
17334 := Don't worry, Elora. I'll save him.
17335 := I have this recording showing Sunry killing Elassa.
17336 := Tell me about Sunry and Elassa.
17337 := [Persuade] Was Sunry having an affair?
17338 := He has killed many Sith before.
17339 := He is a soldier, though.
17340 := Can you tell me anything about Sunry?
17341 := Are you saying someone your age couldn't overpower a woman?
17342 := I don't have time for this.
17343 := Why do you need to speak to Jolee?
17344 := Who are you?
17345 := Maybe I can help your husband.
17346 := I shall tell Jolee immediately.
17347 := I hope you're here to play some Pazaak - I don't come here looking for sparkling conversation.
17348 := So clear out already!
17349 := I prefer to make my credits gambling, but I never turn my back on an opportunity. Maybe this can be a profitable exchange for both of us.
17350 := Ah... I might know a little bit about this. But telling you might put my life at risk. And that don't come cheap.
17351 := See, I can give you a leg up on investigating what the Sith are up to - but it'll cost you 200 credits.
17352 := [Success] Yes... yes, I suppose I do. I want to tell you everything I know.
17353 := Ah - save your threats! Everyone knows breaking the peace here in Ahto City is punishable by a long stretch in the Manaan prisons.
17354 := You must be really desparate, to threaten my life for some lousy information. You want it that bad, maybe I'm undercharging you! 
17355 := You've got a lot of guts, threatening me on this planet! Everyone knows breaking the peace is punishable by imprisonment.
17356 := But I think you just might be crazy enought that you don't care. Okay, I don't need no trouble, so here's the scoop..
17357 := You think I'm some kind of space scum, to sell myself off for a measly 100 credits! You got a real attitude problem, and it's gonna cost you.
17358 := Pretty cheap price for my life, if you ask me. But I guess it's better than nothing, so I'll take it.
17359 := I don't know what the Sith are actually up to, but I know who could tell you. The Iridorian Mercenary. Spends all day in the mercenary enclave, and everyone gives him a wide berth.
17360 := The Sith were cozying up to him real good a while ago. Go speak to him about this. But be careful - them Iridorians have a nasty reputation.
17361 := That's all I know. You want any more info on the Sith and their schemes, go talk to the Iridorian.
17362 := 300 credits or I don't say nothin'!
17363 := They don't bother me, and I don't bother them. Works all around.
17364 := What do you expect when a Sith spy and a Republic war hero are having an affair? Anyone could see it would end ugly.
17365 := Don't know much else. If I did you can bet I'd be blackmailing either the Sith or the Republic to keep quiet.
17366 := Oh-ho! So, you didn't know about Sunry stepping out on his wife? Well it may have been a secret to some, but I'm not blind!
17367 := I should have charged you for that juicy tidbit, but I figured anyone investigating the murder would have already figured that out by now.
17368 := Okay - you got a freebie out of me. But that's all I know about Sunry and his hot Sith side dish.
17369 := Hey, here's an idea - why don't you ask the mercs? Better yet, go down to the embassy and ask the Republic!
17370 := You done wasting my time now, or you got some more questions?
17371 := So why are you wasting my time? Look - I'll give you a break. Every player needs their own Pazaak deck, and I just happen to have an extra one on me.
17372 := I'll sell it to you for 100 credits, and I'll throw in a free lesson cause I'm in a generous mood. 
17373 := Okay, pay attention cause I ain't gonna go over this twice.
17374 := So lay your credits down - we ain't here to play for fun.
17375 := Hey, don't give up. Even you losers get lucky sometimes. Maybe this next hand is your chance to shine - though I doubt it. Want to play again?
17376 := You got lucky that last game - but luck doesn't last. You got the guts to play again?
17377 := I never seen someone win at Pazaak so often with such little skill. So leave me alone okay, I can't afford to bet with someone as lucky as you
17378 := Hey, you hear the news? It seems the Sith bombed some Jedi base on Dantooine into asteroid dust!
17379 := Ain't that a riot? The Jedi are supposed to protect the galaxy, they can't even save their own sorry selves! HA-HA-HA!
17380 := Yeah, you'd think. I mean, ain't they supposed to be so wise and such? Ah, who cares? Sith, Jedi - they're all the same to me anyway.
17381 := All I care about is if someone's got credits to wager and the urge to gamble. So you wanna play some Pazaak or what?
17382 := Oh, really? Well then, Jedi - you must know about the Manaan laws about keeping the peace, so you just...a... keep that lightsaber where it is.
17383 := But there ain't no laws against gambling - and since you're a Jedi I don't have to worry about you cheating. So you wanna play some Pazaak, or what?
17384 := I saw you beat them other pretenders at the Pazaak tourney. Bunch of chumps, if you ask me.
17385 := Saw you in the Pazaak tourney - HA! You crashed and burned like a blind fighter pilot!
17386 := Take my advice - forget about the tourney, you ain't cut out for it. Not unless you get a lot better real fast.
17387 := I hope you didn't waste all your credits on that tourney, 'cause if you've got the guts to play me, I'd love to take whatever you got left.
17388 := You must be here for that Pazaak Masters tournament. Hmph... never had much use for the tourneys - bunch of pretenders if you ask me!
17389 := I can give you a real match before the tourney starts, if you're not scared to play me.
17390 := Oh, it's the big famous Pazaak player. Oh what a glorious day for a nobody like me to be in the presence of such greatness! Now I can die happy! 
17391 := You think you're pretty hot stuff? Well, if you got the nerves for it, I'll show you how a real Pazaak player does it!
17392 := I wasn't expecting guests - and I don't want any, either! Shove off, unless you want more trouble than you can handle. 
17393 := You blind, or just stupid? You see all the security cameras around here? 
17394 := You try anything and the Selkath will throw you into prison to rot.
17395 := Ever since that Sith woman was killed, this place has been under constant surveillance. You try anything and the Selkath will throw you into prison to rot.
17396 := I think I'll be going now.
17397 := I want to ask you some questions.
17398 := Why are the Sith so interested in the Selkath youth?
17399 := [Force Persuade] But I'm your friend - you want to tell me what you know.
17400 := How about you tell me what I want to know, and the Manaan authorities don't find your body washing up on shore?
17401 := I'll give you a 100 credits.
17402 := Here's 200 credits. Now start talking.
17403 := Thanks for the tip.
17404 := That's not very helpful.
17405 := Here's 300 credits. Now start talking!
17406 := What do you think of the Republic?
17407 := What do you think of the Sith?
17408 := Do you know anything about the recent murder? 
17409 := Anything else you can tell me?
17410 := Affair? What are you talking about?
17411 := Do you know why the Republic is hiring so many mercenaries lately?
17412 := I don't know how to play Pazaak.
17413 := It's a deal.
17414 := Sure, I'll play.
17415 := They should have seen it coming.
17416 := Watch what you say - I'm a Jedi!
17417 := You've got a bad attitude. Maybe I can adjust it for you!
17418 := I am not for hire. Perhaps the Mandalorian or the Echani can help you - though they lack the stomach for certain jobs.
17419 := I am not surprised. There are few on this watery world who feel comfortable in my presence.
17420 := Why do you care? There are other mercenaries you can hire. Though I suggest you act quickly - the Republic seems to be in desperate need of mercenaries right now.
17421 := Though not so desperate they have asked for my help as of yet. They prefer the simpering, submissive type - like the Mandalorian and the Echani.
17422 := They lack the resolve to do what needs to be done. The Echani believe in a non-existent warrior code of honor, and the Mandalorians prize credits above bloodshed.
17423 := But I am Iridorian. Honor comes from slaying your opponent, and the true reward of any job is the taste of your foe's dying blood on your tongue.
17424 := Ask whatever you wish - though you may find some of my answers distasteful.
17425 := Manaan has no such things, unless the Selkath have them hidden away at the bottom of the ocean. Is there more you would know?
17426 := On my world those too weak to defend themselves deserve to die. A murder is justified if you have the strength to kill your victim. Is there anything else you would know?
17427 := Perhaps - but my business with the Selkath is my own.
17428 := [Failure] Your threats are mere words, nothing more. Here on Manaan such bloodshed is not permitted - as I have been told time and time again.
17429 := I tire of this conversation and I tire of your company, human. In fact, I tire of this entire weakling world - the air reeks of sea salt and the fawning cowardice of the fish people!
17430 := [Force Persuade] But we are not your enemies... we are your friends. Tell us what you know.
17431 := [Success] You speak the blunt and brutal language of my people. We share the love of death and bloodshed. But we are a rare breed on this planet. Even the Sith here are as weak as the cowardly fish people.
17432 := The Sith sought to buy my loyalty with credits... as if wealth could somehow quench my burning bloodlust! They would have been better off hiring an Echani for the errands they had me running. 
17433 := The task paid well, but was boring and beneath me. I was told to lure the Selkath youth to the Sith Embassy, nothing more. I lied, I threatened, I promised... and I brought the most promising youth of the fish people to the Sith.
17434 := And there I left them. To what purpose I neither know, nor care. Perhaps when the Sith learn I have betrayed their secret they will try to kill me. I would welcome the excitement.
17435 := Is there more you would ask of me, human?
17436 := What then? What happened to the youths?
17437 := This is the way of this water world, is it not? Pathetic creatures bargaining with credits for what they cannot seize through strength. My people are warriors, not snivelling merchants.
17438 := I am of sterner stuff, human. I seek blood and death and my reward is the taste of my enemy's fear. Take your credits elsewhere... my price is too high for the likes of you. 
17439 := But perhaps this world has made me soft. I will play this role, distasteful as it is. For 500 credits, I will tell you what you wish to know.
17440 := I humble myself to change information for mere credits, and you insult me with this game of offers and counter offers? On my home world such insult would result in death! 
17441 := I have no fear of the fish people or their laws. There is no evidence I have done anything wrong. You will not learn my business this way.
17442 := [Success] An Iridorian has no friends! Though I feel a strange kinship with you - you do not seem like the others of this world. Even the Sith here do not understand our kind.
17443 := Perhaps you should ask them. The Republic prefers not to deal with my kind... though maybe they need an Iridorian to finish the job.
17444 := The mercenaries they hire must be failing, as they are never heard from again. That is all I know. Is there more you wish to ask?
17445 := I'll be going now.
17446 := A mercenary who's not for hire. That's strange.
17447 := What do you have against the Echani and the Mandalorians?
17448 := I want to ask you some questions.
17449 := I am seeking an ancient Star Map or some alien ruins.
17450 := Do you know about the murder of Elassa?
17451 := Have you heard anything about young Selkath going missing?
17452 := [Persuade] Maybe I'll just gut you like a Selkath preparing an Orchana ray for lunch.
17453 := What were you doing for the Sith?
17454 := How many credits would it take to make your business my business?
17455 := Make it 200 and we have a deal.
17456 := I don't have that much.
17457 := Here are the credits. Tell me who hired you.
17458 := Maybe the Selkath would be interested in your activities?
17459 := [Force Persuade] But I am your friend. You want to tell me what's going on.
17460 := Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?
17461 := If you're here to offer me a job, I'm not interested right now. I've got so many offers I can't keep up as it is. 
17462 := Maybe that Iridorian skullslacker at the bar, or the Echani nerfherder cowering in the corner is available.
17463 := So why are you telling me? If you're going, go. I don't need a status report.
17464 := I'm a realist. It was war, after all. And even though the Republic destroyed my people, the leaders of the armada were Revan and Malak, so I hate the Sith just as much.
17465 := And with this war, there's plenty of opportunity to take bloody vengeance against both sides and make a nice profit along the way. We Mandalorians are always practical. Not like those blood-thirsty Iridorians, or those honor-bound Echani.
17466 := Is there anything else you want?
17467 := Nothing, except the Echani are a bunch of fey dancers, prancing into battle with tiny weapons not fit for Mandalorian children. They hardly wear any armor because it slows them down when they run away. 
17468 := But the Echani are better than the Iridorians. Those savages keep hacking at fallen foe even after death, mutilating the corpse out of pure blood lust.
17469 := I even heard they'll turn on each other when the battle fever hits. Who wants to work with someone like that? I can pretty much name my price right now, especially since the Republic is so desperate for mercs all of a sudden.
17470 := They ain't saying, but the price sure is right. Of course, I haven't heard of anyone coming back, so I'm guessing the job ain't easy.
17471 := Normally I'd charge you for information, but times are good right now and I'm feeling generous. So ask your questions, free of charge.
17472 := Not really. I have no interest in the Selkath other than the fact that they are charging me an exorbitant amount to stay on this world.
17473 := The Iridorian over there, however... He, I believe, may know more. He has been seen with several of them before.
17474 := If there ever were any ruins on this world, they've long since disappeared beneath the oceans.
17475 := Not really. They say some Republic war hero killed her. Maybe you should check out the Republic Embassy.
17476 := All of a sudden the Republic isn't hiring mercenaries anymore.
17477 := And now the kolto harvest is at an all time low. More than just coincidence, if you ask me.
17478 := So the Sith smoked a Jedi outpost on Dantooine. No survivors, or so they say. First Taris, now Dantooine. Wouldn't surprise me if the Republic starts hiring mercs to make a counter attack.
17479 := They might even hire some Echani or Iridorian mercenaries, if they're desperate. I bet a Mandalorian could make some good money working for the Republic right now.
17480 := Canderous! I haven't seen you since the Republic broke our ranks at the battle of Malachor!
17481 := Ergeron, I see you've got some new guns to add to your collection. Times must have been profitable for you since the war.
17482 := Very profitable. When the Republic defeated our fleets, I learned a valuable lesson: it's far better to be a freelance mercenary in a war than to be a soldier for the losing side.
17483 := I'll be going now.
17484 := Don't you hate the Republic for defeating your people?
17485 := What do you have against the Echani and the Iridorians?
17486 := Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?
17487 := Can I ask you some questions?
17488 := Do you know anything about the young Selkath who have gone missing?
17489 := Do you know anything about ancient ruins or a Star Map?
17490 := Do you know about the murder of Elassa?
17491 := For a while, the Republic were hiring anyone they could get their hands on. Now they don't have any use for us mercs. It's too bad... I could have used the work.
17492 := You notice that Iridorian over there in the corner? Don't stare - it's bad enough he's here in the bar! I don't want him coming over or anything!
17493 := I hear if they go too long between battles, they'll start killing each other just to pass the time. If even half the stories I've heard are true...
17494 := And there's all those rumors of mutilations and torture on helpless prisoners, drinking the warm blood from the wounds of their dying enemies... 
17495 := I never used to believe those rumors... until I saw this guy. I'd rather try to fly through the heart of the Maw with a broken down cargo freighter than have to stare into those cold, dead eyes.
17496 := Those Echani mercs sure travel light. Look at that one over there - nothing but a couple vibroblades and a pair of light blasters on his belt.
17497 := But I've seen his kind in action - they hit hard and fast. And you never have to worry about a double cross with the Echani. I'd rather stand with them then against them in any fight, that's for sure.
17498 := Check out that Mandalorian over there. I hear he's just looking for work, but I wonder. They got their tails whipped by the Republic during the Mandalorian Wars, and from what I hear, his kind can hold a grudge.
17499 := If I was a Republic soldier assigned to work with him, I'd watch my back! Look how much fire power he's carrying! I bet he could wipe out a whole platoon of soldiers before they even knew what hit them.
17500 := Sorry, but I'm not looking for a contract right now. I'm waiting for that guy from the Republic to come by.
17501 := And they say he's paying double wages for mercenaries right now! Whatever the Republic is up to, it must be big!
17502 := Now I'm as cold-blooded as the next guy, but I'm starting to wonder if working for the Sith is a good idea. Bad enough they wiped out Taris... now I hear they did the same to Dantooine.
17503 := Seems like they don't care who they kill, and they don't even need a reason! I need work, but if I have any choice I'll sign on with the Republic.
17504 := Have you news for me, human? Have you discovered why the Republic is hiring mercenaries?
17505 := The Hrakert Rift? It is as I feared - though the Republic is fortunate I was the one assigned to investigate this case. Human, allow me to be blunt with you.
17506 := If I report this violation to my superiors the Republic will be banned from Manaan - but I do not wish to do this.
17507 := I see the Sith for what they truly are: ruthless and evil. The Republic has always respected our independence, but if they fall the Sith will be quick to send an invasion fleet to conquer Manaan.
17508 := But I cannot simply ignore what the Republic has done. The Hrakert Rift is the source of Manaan's kolto, and I fear the science station may damage production of the delicate resource.
17509 := You must tell the Republic to stop this madness at once. Make them shut down the facility and recall their people before they do something we all regret.
17510 := Of course, I should have realized. Doubtless they were hiring the mercenaries to investigate the situation. But I fear mercenaries alone may not be enough to save their station. 
17511 := There are ancient mysteries within the Hrakert Rift that even we Selkath do not comprehend. I fear the Republic has awakened something that was best left undisturbed.
17512 := That is most reassuring, perhaps the situation is not as bad as I had thought. I will keep our conversation secret so that the vile Sith will not gain from the Republic's foolishness.
17513 := A creature? Feeding on the kolto? There are many mysteries of the Rift that we have never known... and that would be one of them.
17514 := The Republic building disturbed it no doubt. What has happened to this creature?
17515 := [Success] It is a most... unexpected development. But one that will warrant investigation at a later time. Perhaps the Republic and we Selkath may eventually solve.
17516 := It is a most... unexpected development. But one that will warrant investigation at a later time. Perhaps the Republic and we Selkath may eventually solve.
17517 := I will keep our conversation secret so that the vile Sith will not gain from the Republic's foolishness.
17518 := Of course, I should have realized. Doubtless they were hiring the mercenaries to investigate the situation. But I fear mercenaries alone may not be enough to save their station. 
17519 := There are ancient mysteries within the Hrakert Rift that even we Selkath do not comprehend. I fear the Republic has awakened something that was best left undisturbed.
17520 := Had I any information, human, I would share it with you willingly. You have done the right thing, informing me of this... but I must ask something more of you.
17521 := I fear the mercenaries will not find the answers the Republic is looking for - they prefer blasters to brains. But you have shown yourself to be resourceful.
17522 := Perhaps you can succeed where the others have failed. Investigate this facility, human - and I promise to keep my silence so that the vile Sith do not gain from the Republic's foolishness.
17523 := As you wish. Perhaps you will find the answers the mercenaries could not. I will keep our conversation secret so that the vile Sith will not gain from the Republic's foolishness.
17524 := I only hope my silence does not lead to disaster for Manaan. Here is the payment I promised you. 
17525 := And now I must take my leave, human. My superiors are expecting a full report from me, and there is much I must do to ensure they cannot uncover the Republic's actions.
17526 := Hmmm. You think the Republic is trying to steal the kolto, perhaps? An odd thing for the Republic to do, no?
17527 := The Hrakert Rift is the source of kolto? Why would the Republic risk so much to send troops there? I don't get it.
17528 := Once you have the answers I seek, I will gladly pay you the 500 credits I promised.
17529 := Greetings, human. My name is Nilko Bwaas. I hope you are enjoying yourself here in Ahto City. Our floating city is beautiful, is it not?
17530 := You are blunt human - but that is perhaps what I require.
17531 := There is a task I would ask, human... Jedi. I fear there is nowhere else I can turn.
17532 := Rest assured, there will be ample reward for this human. I only require information, nothing more.
17533 := The Republic has been hiring mercenaries - many more than usual. As an official of the Selkath people, this is of great concern to me. I only seek the reason for this change in Republic policy.
17534 := Uncover the truth behind the Republic's actions, and I will pay you 500 credits.
17535 := Please - see if you can find the answers I seek. Find why the Republic is hiring so many mercenaries, find where they are going. Find why they do not return.
17536 := If you discover any information and you change your mind, please come speak to me. I will be here waiting for you.
17537 := Once you have the answers I seek, I will gladly pay you the 500 credits I promised.
17538 := Once you discover some information, please come speak to me. Believe it or not, I am a friend of the Republic. Whatever the truth, I shall do my best to protect the Republic's interests - and those of the Selkath, of course.
17539 := I'm uncomfortable with spying on the Republic... but if we could assure the Selkath that they mean no harm, then perhaps it might be worth it.
17540 := And what if the Republic does mean harm, Carth? Will you tell them?
17541 := If the Republic did mean harm to the Selkath, then I want to know what the Selkath did to provoke it.
17542 := How very noble of you.
17543 := I cannot trust anyone else. The Republic obviously wants to keep their secret - I have inquired often as to their purpose and been rebuffed.
17544 := The Sith cannot be trusted to give me an accurate report of events - they will twist the truth so that it furthers their own goals.
17545 := And the mercenaries are well aware of the high wages the Republic is paying - they would not report anything that might slow the flow of credits into their accounts.
17546 := I am no enemy of the Republic, human. I only seek assurances that there is no harm being done to Manaan. The Republic may be bringing ruin onto us all without even knowing it! 
17547 := I am afraid you speak the truth, human. My people are suspicious of outsiders, they fear the destruction of our beautiful planet.
17548 := I suppose tastes vary widely across the galaxy, human. And yet, the planet is beautiful to me and my people.
17549 := You are too gracious, human.
17550 := The beauty of Manaan is delicate. Our ecosystem is complex and fragile, and I fear for the preservation of my planet.
17551 := Human, I wish to speak to you if you have the time.
17552 := Yes - they're sending them down to a secret base on the Hrakert Rift.
17553 := They couldn't. They had lost contact with the science facility.
17554 := The Republic's harvesting has stopped.
17555 := I have cleared the facility.
17556 := They awoke a creature which fed on the kolto.
17557 := [Lie] The creature is dead.
17558 := The creature is dead.
17559 := [Lie] The creature is alive.
17560 := The creature is alive.
17561 := They can't. The Republic has recently lost contact with the science facility.
17562 := What do you suggest we do?
17563 := It sounds like you know more than you are telling me.
17564 := I am going to investigate the Hrakert Rift.
17565 := No, I'm still looking into it.
17566 := Cut the small talk. What do you want?
17567 := Sorry, I'm not interested.
17568 := What's in this for me?
17569 := Forget it, I'm not interested.
17570 := I'll do it, but only for the money.
17571 := I'll look into it for you, Nilko.
17572 := Why do you need me for this?
17573 := Forget it - I won't spy on the Republic!
17574 := What do you want me to do?
17575 := You're a lot more friendly than most of the Selkath here.
17576 := Eh - I've seen better.
17577 := It's truly a wonder to behold.
17578 := I think I'll be going now.
17579 := What are you talking about?
17580 := *growl* *snarl* When I get out of here, you're dead! I'll gut your fishy little corpse, cut off your head and bathe in your blood!
17581 := Be quiet, off-world scum!
17582 := I'm sick of hearing about Manaan's neutrality! It sounds like a coward's excuse not to fight, if you ask me!
17583 := If it weren't for the Republic, Manaan would already be under Sith control. But we haven't had one word of thanks from the Selkath!
17584 := Why can't the Selkath see what the Sith are really like? They should ban them all from this planet.
17585 := The Republic respects the peace of Ahto City, your honor. But the Sith are a violent people who leave violence in their wake. I have three soldiers in the infirmary!
17586 := If the Republic soldiers were more capable, they would not have suffered such serious injuries. Are my soldiers to be punished simply because they won a fair fight?
17587 := I hardly call six against three a fair fight! The Sith are cowards who attack only when they have the advantage of numbers!
17588 := I am aware of the Republic's indignation. However, witness reports clearly state your Republic soldiers were as willing to engage in violence as the Sith in this case.
17589 := They were provoked, your honor! The Sith goaded them into this fight!
17590 := Taunts and threats are not sufficient provocation in the eyes of this court. Words can be ignored - which is what your men should have done.
17591 := I find both the Republic and the Sith to be equally at fault for this breach of the peace. 
17592 := I should throw all parties involved into the Ahto City jail. But since no Selkath were harmed in this conflict I will show mercy and levy a fine of ten thousand credits to both sides.
17593 := The court is dismissed, though I warn you that further disturbances will not be viewed with such leniency.
17594 := Do you mind? I'm in the middle of a Republic recruiting drive right now. I need to hire these mercenaries before they sign up with the Sith.
17595 := Good. The longer I spend talking to you, the less time I have to talk to the mercs.
17596 := I don't know if you've got what we're looking for... Jedi aren't generally suited to mercenary work. If you want, talk to Roland Wann at the Republic Embassy and see if he can find anything for you.
17597 := It's north of here, then east past the first courtyard. It's just off the north end of the second courtyard. You can't miss it.
17598 := Now if you'll excuse me, I have to continue my recruitments.
17599 := In case you hadn't noticed, there's a war on. If we don't hire these mercs, the Sith will. Now excuse me, I have to continue my recruitments.
17600 := So do we have a deal?
17601 := That's an awful lot of money... is there something you're not telling me?
17602 := Don't be so suspicious. The Republic is generous, we pay our mercenaries well.
17603 := Makes sense, I guess. Alright, I'm in. When do I start?
17604 := Just show up at the Republic Embassy tomorrow and speak to our Representative there. I'm sure he'll have some task he wants you to start on right away.
17605 := I'll be going now.
17606 := Maybe you could hire me?
17607 := Why are you hiring mercenaries?
17608 := Why are you disturbing me, off-worlder? I did not indicate I wished to converse with you.
17609 := Why do you disturb me, off-worlder? Are you trying to recruit me to your cause? You should save your lung gas - this Selkath's neutrality is not for sale.
17610 := I have no wish to talk with your kind, off-worlder! I have heard the rumors. We Selkath know your kind are to blame for the poor kolto harvest.
17611 := Greetings, off-worlder. While I do not have time to converse with you, I hope you find what you are looking for here on Manaan.
17612 := The Sith have tried to manipulate our courts time and again, seeking power for themselves. I hope our government decides to do more against this.
17613 := I find it shocking that a hero of the Republic - Sunry - could do such a thing. Perhaps I have been wrong in my judgment of the Republic.
17614 := Many say that the Republic has had something to do with the economic restriction our people have placed on all trade. I hope it is not true.
17615 := You will stay here in the prison until your fine of 100 credits is paid. If you wish you can sell your equipment to acquire the necessary credits.
17616 := You are now free to go, human. Remember to keep the peace, or you will face the penalties once more.
17617 := [Failure] You try to influence my mind! You truly are a danger. You will stay here until you pay the fine or rot.
17618 := I will station a droid here so that you will not be able to manipulate it's mind.
17619 := [Success] Perhaps we were wrong about you, human. You may go.
17620 := You will find our prices are fair human. After selling your equipment, speak to me again to pay your fine.
17621 := Then you shall rot in here. If you change your mind, speak to me again.
17622 := You have been charged with flagrant violations of the Ahto City laws, and insubordination towards a Selkath constable. The fine is 500 credits.
17623 := You will stay here in the prison until your fine is paid. If you wish, you can sell your equipment to acquire the necessary credits.
17624 := Here are the 100 credits.
17625 := [Force Persuade] You really want to let me go. I have done nothing.
17626 := I need to sell some equipment.
17627 := I'm not paying you anything!
17628 := Here are the 500 credits.
17629 := Greetings, human. There are few places in Ahto City where off-worlders are welcome, but here they are at least tolerated.
17630 := Until next time, human.
17631 := I am far too busy to spend my time conversing, human. I must reserve my time for paying customers, not idle gossip.
17632 := I am certain you will see that all of my inventory is of superior quality.
17633 := Greetings, human. Your reputation for Pazaak preceeds you. If you wish, feel free to play within this establishment.
17634 := Others who share your interest in the game often come here to play - and to partake of my fine wares.
17635 := Greetings human. You have done the Selkath a great service by uncovering the Sith plot to corrupt our youth.
17636 := To show the appreciation of my people, you shall find all my wares have been marked down with a substantial discount.
17637 := You will find my prices have increased dramatically, human. Kolto production is faltering, and the Manaan government has raised all taxes on goods sold to foreigners.
17638 := I think I'll be going now.
17639 := I want to ask you a few questions.
17640 := I'd like to see what's in stock.
17641 := You may come and go as you please, Arbiter - you will find the door unlocked.
17642 := If you wish to begin your trial, you must make the request with the warden. It shall then be passed on to the judges.
17643 := Sunry's trial is over, human. You are no longer an Arbiter of the Selkath courts. I cannot allow you into the cells.
17644 := Only the Arbiters are permitted into the prison cells, human.
17645 := I am sorry. I will be going now.
17646 := I am Judge Shelkar acting on behalf of the Selkath government of Manaan. It is my task today to answer the needs of off-world citizens of both the Republic and the Sith Empire.
17647 := If you have legitimate grievances with another party then you should speak to me. You should first, however, consult with the Republic Embassy before pressing formal charges.
17648 := Is there something you wish to bring to my attention?
17649 := Then go and enjoy Ahto City. And do not break any laws that we would have to lock you up for.
17650 := The court is unaware of any missing beings reports. Should any substantial evidence come up in regards to such a disappearance, you should file it with us and an investigation will be launched.
17651 := Is there anything else you require?
17652 := A Star Map? Hm... not precisely... but Manaan holds many wonderous and exciting locales and treasures, kolto not the least of them.
17653 := Our many shops and boulevards cater to the whim of any species and provide a vibrant night-life that has to be seen to be believed.
17654 := This and other tourist paraphenalia can be had from your local embassy... So do not waste my time with it.
17655 := That is acceptable, I believe. In Manaan legal tradition the defendant can have an Arbiter who tries to prove his innocence in court.
17656 := This Arbiter is a neutral party that can investigate and present evidence in the trial, and argue on the defendant's behalf. As you are a Jedi, I believe you could fulfill this role adequately.
17657 := So be it! You are now appointed Arbiter in the case of Sunry vs. The Sith Empire. Your name and position have been recorded in our files.
17658 := I will now inform you of the pertinent facts in this case. You have a limited amount of time in which to investigate and organize a defense of your client, and I advise you to use it wisely.
17659 := Sunry was seen leaving a hotel, leaving behind a dead Sith woman - Elassa Huros. He has been charged with murder and is being held in the Ahto City prison facilities. Due to his crippled status he is being kept in a solitary holding cell.
17660 := Witnesses claimed to have seen the killing and are being detained at the hotel in question pending the trial. The manager of the hotel has now been informed of your appointment.
17661 := Elassa was found dead of a blaster wound with an incriminating Republic medal clutched in her hand. This information has been uploaded to your datapad. It would be wise to review all information before the trial starts.
17662 := You may question Sunry or the witnesses. The evidence in this case is heavily stacked against Mr. Sunry. I believe it will take some doing to absolve him of guilt.
17663 := You may also interview the judges here, including myself, to get an idea of the pertinent factors in this case.
17664 := Since this is also your first case, and you are an off-worlder, I feel compelled to add "good luck" as my final missive.
17665 := Yes... but it almost seems too heavily stacked, doesn't it? Very suspicious.
17666 := We'll do our best. You can count on that.
17667 := Jedi are renowned for being arbiters in times of need. We will investigate this matter as best we are able.
17668 := I suppose you're Sunry's only hope. We have to at least try to help him.
17669 := Your ship registry is originally from the Republic world of Transel. Therefore you are a Republic citizen.
17670 := Or are you saying you STOLE your ship?
17671 := I see. Is there more you need?
17672 := Your task with the courts has been completed, human. You have fulfilled your role as Arbiter to the satisfaction of this court.
17673 := Should you have any other grievances you wish to present, give them to the judge on duty at that time.
17674 := As Arbiter of the Sunry murder trial you have the authority to question me on matters pertaining to this case.
17675 := Very well. When you feel you have gathered enough evidence, you may speak to the warden in charge of the prison where Sunry is being held. He will bring Sunry to us and the trial will commence.
17676 := You have the right, Arbiter, to ask me questions regarding the case.
17677 := What is it you wish to ask?
17678 := The governing bodies of both states seek to keep an amicable relationship with our world in order to facilitate the exporting of kolto.
17679 := I do not delude myself into thinking that either of your states holds any great love for us, but we are necessary so you will let us hold our autonomy.
17680 := I try not to concern myself with intragalactic policy. I find it stretches the letter of the law too much for my tastes.
17681 := Is there something else that concerns you, human?
17682 := Yes, there is something that has been bothering me: the medal that was found clutched in the Sith's hand.
17683 := I find it most odd that such a blatantly incriminating piece of evidence would be left at the scene of the crime.
17684 := We have analyzed the evidence and it does not appear to be a replica, but I still have my doubts.
17685 := In the midst of the crime, though, Sunry could well have lost it. I have seen much more improbable things happen in my tenure to the courts.
17686 := Is there another matter you wish to inquire about, human?
17687 := Hmmm. Simply because it was real does not mean Sunry would have overlooked it being in Elassa's hand.
17688 := Sunry is known to us as a hero of the Republic in your perpetual conflicts with the Sith Empire.
17689 := While he may have been severely injured in the line of duty, I personally hold him in quite high regard.
17690 := In no way does his disability hamper him, though. Rest assured that my personal regard for Sunry will not affect my judgment. While emotion may rule your Senate, the cold hard hand of the law rules here on Manaan.
17691 := Is there anything else you wished to ask me, human?
17692 := Well, speaking of that injury... does that not make it seem unlikely that he killed anyone?
17693 := Speaking of that injury, has it been taken into consideration, your honor?
17694 := I have no more questions, your honor.
17695 := What do you know about the young Selkath who have been going missing?
17696 := Is there a Star Map on this world?
17697 := I would like to investigate the murder case involving Sunry.
17698 := How did you know I was from the Republic?
17699 := No, no... perfectly legitimate.
17700 := I have no more questions for now.
17701 := I have questions about the trial.
17702 := I want to ask you something else.
17703 := What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?
17704 := Is there anything suspicious about this case?
17705 := What do you think of Sunry?
17706 := Only those on legitimate business should consult the judges personally.
17707 := For additional inquiries, Judge Shelkar is available for consultation.
17708 := Since your case is done, you should refrain from abusing your past familiarity.
17709 := Since you have been designated Arbiter in the Sunry case, I shall answer questions that you might have.
17710 := Return if you have pertinent details about the case to discuss.
17711 := Both empires are at fault for this current conflict. The Republic in the past for laying the foundations upon which the Sith Empire grew. And the Sith now, obviously, for starting the war.
17712 := But no matter the wrongs that had been done in the past, the Sith now have no cause for renewing hostilities. It almost seems as if they just want to conquer everything!
17713 := I believe the Republic has every right to defend itself and drive the Sith back where they came from.
17714 := Unfortunately for them... and perhaps for us... they do not seem to be doing too good a job of it.
17715 := Was there anything else you want to know?
17716 := 'Almost seems'? They do wish to conquer everything, and will not stop at Manaan. Why the Selkath believe themselves invulnerable I have no idea.
17717 := Well I have often wondered, if Sunry were so innocent, why was he seen fleeing the scene of the crime?
17718 := Why would he have been running if he had not committed the crime himself, or was at least aware of what had occurred?
17719 := This case seems fairly simple and obvious to me. You Republic types stick together, however, and I assume you will go to lengths to defend him.
17720 := What else do you want to ask?
17721 := The Republic believes in justice, as do you. We just want Sunry to be fairly treated, that's all.
17722 := Sunry is a former Republic officer who is highly regarded by your people. He is admired by your people here on Manaan, and even seems to maintain some sort of relations with them still.
17723 := If he is as capable as some of the Republic citizens still believe him to be, he is certainly capable of actions that would result in this murder.
17724 := Is there anything else you wish to ask in relation to this case?
17725 := I have no more questions for now.
17726 := What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?
17727 := Is there anything suspicious about this case?
17728 := What do you think of Sunry?
17729 := Do not disturb me, off-worlder, I am busy.
17730 := I suppose I must spend some time talking to you since you are here in an official capacity. What do you need?
17731 := Then go and do not disturb me unless you have trial business to discuss.
17732 := I do not buy into the Republic line that this is some epic battle of the 'good' Republic against the 'evil' Sith Empire.
17733 := The Sith empire is merely an expansionistic power, much like the Republic was early in its history.
17734 := It is simply the turning of history, where the old is swept away by the better new.
17735 := Is there anything intelligent you wish to know?
17736 := I find this case to be fairly straight forward. Sunry is from the Republic, Elassa from the Sith. The great empires battling now live out their conflict through their minions too.
17737 := Is that all?
17738 := Sunry was a Republic soldier, a hero even. Do you think his Republic masters would let someone so valuable go so easily?
17739 := I think not. I think Sunry maintains his contacts with the Republic and seeks to escalate the situation here.
17740 := Is there something else you require?
17741 := I have no more questions for now.
17742 := What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?
17743 := Is there anything suspicious about this case?
17744 := What do you think of Sunry?
17745 := Republic citizens are welcome on Manaan, but official inquiries should go through the proper channels.
17746 := Judge Shelkar can answer questions of off-world visitors during normal hours.
17747 := Your function with the courts is complete. You should not interrupt our proceddings in this manner.
17748 := Ah, the Arbiter. Since you have been permitted to defend Sunry against these accusations I shall assist how I can.
17749 := If there is anything else you require, feel free to inquire with me.
17750 := I find this great battle being waged across the galaxy both disturbing and, ultimately, tragic.
17751 := For all its faults, your tottering Republic has benefitted the vast majority of the galaxy for many millenia. To see it fall into ruin in such a short time...
17752 := I do not like the Sith, that I make no effort to hide. I will even admit that if given the option, I would rule that we should join the Republic.
17753 := But I must remain impartial and rule on this case as the law requires.
17754 := Do you have any additional questions?
17755 := I find it questionable that a man with such a reputable past as Sunry would murder a Sith woman. Especially not from behind.
17756 := But knowing the Sith, there was probably some deception involved. They seek to do the same thing to us here.
17757 := There has been much pressure by the Sith on our government - and even on the judges themselves - to deliver a guilty verdict in this case.
17758 := But the letter of the law is absolute, and we will not be compromised for Sith power-games.
17759 := Is there anything else you need?
17760 := Sunry was a great warrior in his time. He fought for the Republic against the Sith aggression and proved valorous.
17761 := I have great respect for his accomplishments and find it tragic that he finds himself in his current condition.
17762 := If the Republic had more individuals like him right now, I do not believe the Sith would be so great a problem for your people.
17763 := Is there any other way I can assist you?
17764 := I have no more questions for now.
17765 := What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?
17766 := Is there anything suspicious about this case?
17767 := What do you think of Sunry?
17768 := I don't waste time on individuals who are not involved in my legal jurisdiction. Do not disturb me.
17769 := I shall answer questions pertaining to the case and those questions only.
17770 := Do not bring frivilous topics to discuss. I deal only with trial information.
17771 := I think the Republic is an institution in sore need of change. It has gone on too long and the Sith are the fresh wind of change blowing across the galaxy.
17772 := I do not believe in the false stories of the evils of the Sith Empire. They are nothing compared to the oppression and stagnation that the Republic represents at its core.
17773 := If I was given the power to decide, Manaan would join with the Sith, forcing the Republic to accept the new face of the future.
17774 := But sadly, it would appear that I am wiser and more farsighted than my immediate superiors. I am relegated to civil judicial matters.
17775 := I will judge this case. And I will find Sunry as guilty as he is charged to be.
17776 := Are you finished?
17777 := Hey! I thought you Selkath judges were supposed to follow the law! You can't already have decided that Sunry is guilty!
17778 := If you had listened, Carth, you would know that that *is* the law. Sunry is guilty until proven innocent.
17779 := That's a stupid law for any civilized world to have.
17780 := Angering the judge won't get us a more impartial decision, Carth.
17781 := It is up to you off-worlders to prove the human's innocence. I simply doubt that you will be capable of doing so.
17782 := So nice to meet an impartial judge, for a change.
17783 := Impartiality is one thing. Blindness is another entirely.
17784 := You said it, not I.
17785 := I find it presumptuous to assume that the cripple Sunry could kill Elassa. I think that there must have been another there who killed her. Perhaps one of the 'witnesses'.
17786 := I do not know the reason for the medal clutched in Elassa's hand either, but it may have been that she fought them off even as she died.
17787 := I think this may be the work of some Republic conspiracy and I am not afraid to say so! If the only means I have of hurting the Republic is through Sunry, then so be it!
17788 := Is that all?
17789 := I find the idea that some half-human cripple could murder someone as obviously competent as the Sith Elassa questionable at best.
17790 := A man who can barely walk killed a Sith warrior in her prime? Preposterous!
17791 := But I wouldn't put it past the Republic to try and arrange such circumstances to see her dead. The Sith are much more straight forward about their intentions.
17792 := Is that all?
17793 := I have no more questions for now.
17794 := What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?
17795 := Is there anything suspicious about this case?
17796 := What do you think of Sunry?
17797 := What is it that I can do for you now?
17798 := Very well then. I will, of course, be here if you need something else.
17799 := Are you certain, human? Once the trial has begun it cannot be stopped. And once judgment is given, the case can never be reopened.
17800 := You must be certain your investigations are complete before you request a trial. This is the role of the Arbiter. Are you certain you wish to begin the trial now?
17801 := That is your right as Arbiter. When you are ready to proceed with the trial come speak to me.
17802 := Very well, human. I shall advise the court and we will begin immediately.
17803 := Sunry is from the Republic. Elassa was from the Sith. They kill each other all the time. What more is there to know?
17804 := But as to the details, that is for the judges of our courts to decide.
17805 := Is there anything else you need?
17806 := Yes, I am aware of this fact, human. He is in his cage over there and I am sure can hear you quite clearly.
17807 := Is there anything else you need?
17808 := Yes, actually I have. We find it very suspicious, but there are no signs of kidnappings.
17809 := It is likely, though, that it has been perpetrated by out-worlders... ones such as yourself perhaps...
17810 := Is there anything else you need?
17811 := No I do not. And it is quite illogical to think that a being who spends his entire day locked in a room with insane people and murderers would know much about the outside world.
17812 := Is there anything else you need?
17813 := So you are the Arbiter in the Sunry-Elassa murder case then. I hope you are as impartial as the office is traditionally supposed to be.
17814 := You off-worlders have a tendency to ignore the rule of law in favor of some rather irrational causes.
17815 := Nothing for now.
17816 := I want to begin Sunry's trial now.
17817 := Actually, I've reconsidered. I don't want a trial just yet.
17818 := Are you deaf, flipper head? Let's get this trial over with!
17819 := Yes, let's begin the trial.
17820 := What do you know about the murder of Elassa?
17821 := I am here to see the prisoner Sunry.
17822 := Have you heard about young Selkath going missing?
17823 := Do you know anything about a Star Map?
17824 := Human, you return. Have you information for me? Have you discovered the fate of the missing Selkath youth? Have you news of my daughter, Shasa?
17825 := Excellent. You have done well. What have you learned?
17826 := I have already given you an additional 100 credits! I have nothing more to give, human! Have you no heart, no compassion?
17827 := I... I have nothing more to give, human. The 500 credits I promised you for the fate of my daughter are all I have left. 
17828 := I suppose I can do nothing more but wait here, in case you change your mind. I can only hope you find find it in your heart to take pity on a grieving parent. 
17829 := I suppose I should thank you, human - though you have already exploited my grief well enough for your own gain. What information do you have for me now?
17830 := I am confused, human. How will credits facilitate your cognitive functions? Oh... I believe I understand.
17831 := This is what you off-worlders call a shakedown, is it not? I am not wealthy, human. I have offered 500 credits for information on my daughter and the other missing Selkath. Is this not enough?
17832 := Very well, human. You prey upon my grief and concern over my missing daughter, but I am desperate. Here is another 100 credits - that is all I have.
17833 := I am pleased you have not chosen to exploit my loss for your personal greed, human. What have you discovered?
17834 := Yes... this makes sense. It is a wonder I did not see this before. Manaan's greatest strength is our neutrality.
17835 := If Malak brainwashes our youth and indoctrinates them in the ways of the Sith he will have a strong following among the Selkath people - strong enough to seize control of Manaan and our kolto!
17836 := My daughter, Shasa - she too has been indoctrined into the Sith camp?
17837 := Shasa... No! This is most terrible! Most terrible indeed!
17838 := I must go now, human, to inform the Selkath authorities of what is transpiring. Here is the money I have promised you.
17839 := Shasa, my daughter, what have those Sith monsters done to your mind? I will report this to the authorities, though I fear without proof there is little they can do to get my daughter back.
17840 := I thank you for all you have done, human. Here are the credits I promised you.
17841 := I would not have expected such rudeness from a Jedi... but you have rendered a valuable service. Here is your money.
17842 := A datapad? Let me see... Yes! Of course! This details the Sith plot to brainwash the Selkath youth! With this proof the Ahto City authorities will have to take action!
17843 := My daughter will surely be returned to me now, human!
17844 := Human, if you speak the truth I am forever in your debt! And yet, my joy is tempered by the knowledge that the Sith still walk freely about Manaan.
17845 := Hopefully the testimony of my daughter will be enough proof of their actions, to make the Ahto City authorites take action.
17846 := You have done much for me, human. Here are the credits I promised you - I only wish I had more to give.
17847 := You refuse my reward? Truly you humans are a noble breed! Perhaps my species has underestimated your kind.
17848 := Please excuse me now, human. I must go speak to the Manaan authorities about this Sith plot and what they have done to my beloved daughter.
17849 := A datapad? Yes, I see! This datapad has all the details of the entire Sith plot! With this the Manaan authorities will be forced to take action!
17850 := I doubt the Sith will be banned from Manaan, but at the very least they will face harsh restrictions on their kolto exports!
17851 := You... you are a monster! I came to you for aid, and you betray me and slaughter my innocent Shasa! You are no better than the Sith!
17852 := Take your blood money, human! May it bring you as much grief and misfortune as you have brought me!
17853 := No! Say it is not so, human! No - not Shasa! The Sith will pay for this! If it is the last thing I do they will pay!
17854 := I... I thank you for what you have done here, human - though I wish my daughter's fate had been otherwise. Here are the credits I promised you. 
17855 := I... I thank you once more, human. I wish all your species were as kind and noble as you.
17856 := Please, excuse me now, human. I desire no company but my own.
17857 := A datapad? Let me see. Of course - this details the entire Sith plot! With this evidence I can go to the Ahto City authorities!
17858 := The Sith will face severe fines and export restrictions for their actions - a poor substitute for my daughter's life, but with any luck the kolto embargo will weaken the Sith war effort.
17859 := I see. This information is useful, for a start. But it does little to explain the truth of this matter. We must know what purpose the Sith have for these youth.
17860 := Are they prisoners of the Sith? Are they even still alive? I must know more, human. I must know what has happened to my daughter!
17861 := This information is mere bait - the catch yet awaits, human. Once you discover the ultimate fate of my daughter, I will gladly give you the 500 credits I promised.
17862 := I cannot officially ask you to enter the Sith base, human. That would be a violation of Ahto City's strict neutrality laws. However, I fear such a brazen act may be the only way to learn the truth.
17863 := But entering the base will not be easy. And should you be captured or killed, I will have to disavow any knowledge of your actions.
17864 := You shall have no reward from me until I learn the fate of my daughter, human! If you change your mind and discover her fate, you can report to me here to collect your reward.
17865 := I wish I could be of more help, human. I will wait here. Return to me when you have something more to report.
17866 := I am sorry, human. You have made your relationship with the Sith quite clear. I have no further business with you.
17867 := Greetings, human. My name is Shaelas. I have heard it said that you are no friend of the Sith. Is this true?
17868 := You like the Sith? You are obviously not the person I am looking for to complete this task.
17869 := Your words are strange, human. You claim one thing, then the exact opposite. Perhaps this is what your species calls humor. If so, its appeal eludes me.
17870 := However, I believe you now speak the truth about your dislike of the Sith.
17871 := You are wise to be so guarded, human. But my sources are rarely wrong, and they have informed me that you are no friend of Malak's people.
17872 := Though I suspect we have little in common, human, I share your dislike of the Sith. They have brought grief to my family.
17873 := I am not a fool, I know the Sith do not respect our laws as the Republic does. Were it up to me, I would do everything in my power to aid the Republic in the war against Malak.
17874 := But intergalactic politics stay my hand. Still, I know the Sith are evil - and I fear what they will do to my people. And what they may be doing now.
17875 := Many of the Selkath have vanished, human. Most who have gone missing are on the cusp of adulthood, the youth who will someday lead this planet. My own daughter, Shasa, is among those who have disappeared.
17876 := These disappearances coincide with the arrival of the Sith, and I cannot dismiss the connection. The Sith are up to something, human. Something sinister - I can feel it!
17877 := I will give you 500 credits if you can uncover the fate of my daughter and the other missing Selkath youth. Not much, but all I can afford. I have no official authority in this matter, and my personal wealth is not vast. 
17878 := There is no one else I can turn to, human. The Republic agents are too closely watched by the Sith, and the Ahto City authorities cannot act without proof of Sith involvement. 
17879 := I see, human. Despite your rebuff, my offer still stands - I have nowhere else to turn. Return to me if you obtain information on my daughter and the other missing Selkath youth, and I will reward you as promised.
17880 := I cannot imagine where to begin the investigation, though I suspect the Sith did not act alone. Perhaps the off-worlders in the mercenary enclave know something. 
17881 := If you learn anything, human, report back to me at once. If you uncover the fate of my daughter and the other missing Selkath youth, I will reward you as promised.
17882 := Human, I wish to speak with you.
17883 := I've decided I've got better things to do than be your errand slave.
17884 := I have information for you, Shaelas.
17885 := Sorry, nothing yet.
17886 := Maybe a few credits could refresh my memory.
17887 := Sorry - no credits, no info.
17888 := Fine. I'll tell you what I know.
17889 := If you want news on your daughter, find a way to get those extra credits.
17890 := Very well. I'll tell you what I know.
17891 := The Sith are training the Selkath youth in the ways of the Dark Jedi.
17892 := Your daughter has joined the Sith.
17893 := Your daughter is still with the Sith, Shaelas.
17894 := Give me my money and get out of here.
17895 := Maybe this datapad will help.
17896 := I've convinced your daughter to turn her back on the Sith ways.
17897 := Keep your credits, Shaelas. A Jedi has no need of such rewards.
17898 := Thank you, Shaelas.
17899 := Maybe this datapad will help.
17900 := I killed your daughter, Shaelas. Just as I'll kill you if you tell anyone about this. Now give me those credits!
17901 := Blah, blah, blah - give me the credits if you want to live.
17902 := Your daughter is dead, Shaelas.
17903 := Keep your credits, Shaelas. I wouldn't feel right about taking them now.
17904 := I'm sorry it had to be this way, Shaelas.
17905 := Perhaps this datapad will help.
17906 := The Sith hired an Iridorian mercenary to lure the Selkath youth to the Sith base.
17907 := Does this mean I don't get paid?
17908 := What do you suggest I do?
17909 := I will look into this further.
17910 := Forget it - I'm not about to break into the Sith base looking for your web fingered offspring!
17911 := I'll infiltrate the Sith base, Shaelas.
17912 := Not yet. I shall investigate further.
17913 := Actually, I kind of like the Sith. They've got style.
17914 := What task?
17915 := I'm just kidding.
17916 := My allegiances are my own business.
17917 := The Sith are a blight upon the galaxy!
17918 := Just get to the point, Shaelas.
17919 := What are you talking about?
17920 := Sorry, I'm not interested.
17921 := What's in this for me?
17922 := I've got better things to do than look for missing tadpoles.
17923 := I shall look into these disappearances for you, Shaelas.
17924 := You want me to investigate these disappearances?
17925 := Manaan should treat us Sith better - their day of reckoning approaches. 
17926 := The Selkath have forgotten the lesson of Taris. Perhaps we should remind them.
17927 := They say everyone on Manaan is equal. But it seems the Republic is a little more equal than the Sith. Neutrality? Ha! That's a laugh!
17928 := One day soon the Selkath will pay for the indignities they have inflicted on the Sith!
17929 := Your honor, the Republic is clearly in violation of Manaan's laws!
17930 := These wild Sith accusations have no basis, your honor. Where is the proof?
17931 := I must admit, these charges are hard to believe without proof. If the Republic are using submersibles to explore the ocean floor, surely there would be some evidence. 
17932 := The evidence has been covered up, your honor - by your own people! I believe high level Ahto City officials are conspiring with the Republic.
17933 := You go too far, off-worlder! I will not listen to unfounded charges against Selkath officials in my court! 
17934 := But, your honor - these charges cannot be ignored!
17935 := Enough, my decision has been made. If you find proof I shall reopen this case. Until then, I find no evidence of these alleged crimes. This court is dismissed.
17936 := I have no desire to speak to you. I know you have links to the Republic.
17937 := We might have a position within the Sith organization for one such as you.
17938 := Your offer is pretty good. But I've heard some nasty things about you Sith. Is it true you bombed Taris into dust?
17939 := This is war. In war certain distasteful acts cannot be avoided. But ask yourself this - when we win the war, would you rather be against the Sith, or with us?
17940 := You make a good point. And I've never turned down a job that pays up front.
17941 := Excellent. Report to the Sith Embassy tomorrow for your assignment.
17942 := Jolee - coming to check in on an old man? I must confess, I... I would rather you were here to speak to the warden and begin my trial. 
17943 := Soon, old friend. But we don't want to go to trial until we've got the whole picture.
17944 := Ah, I see you're back. Not that I don't appreciate the visit, but I had hoped you were going to speak to the warden so we might begin the trial.
17945 := I grow weary of staring at these four bare walls. But I suppose you know what you are doing. You know the role of Arbiter cannot be taken lightly.
17946 := Who are you? What are you doing here?
17947 := Jolee? What's he doing here on Manaan? Never mind - I'm just glad he's here. So is this some kind of prison break? If it is we won't get very far before the Selkath cut us down I can tell ya.
17948 := Well, I guess if you're going to be my Arbiter you'll need to hear what happened. I might as well start at the beginning.
17949 := The case is a complete frame-up. Anyone looking at the evidence could see that - or so I thought. But the Selkath seem to think, well that there's enough to go to trial.
17950 := There aren't any witnesses. All that evidence against me is circumstantial... and completely flawed.
17951 := Very well. I suppose there is still much you must do before the trial. 
17952 := Once you've gotten enough evidence to go to trial just tell the warden we're ready. The sooner I get out of this cell the better.
17953 := Go ahead, ask... ask what you need to. I've got nothing to hide.
17954 := Er... OK. What else do you want to know?
17955 := How would they know? They weren't there!
17956 := I heard some of the witnesses said that too, but I swear she was alive when I left!
17957 := I wonder if the Sith have been putting pressure on people to get them to convict me... It wouldn't surprise me at all. They've had it in for me since the war...
17958 := You should ask everyone about that... they might admit to helping the Sith under pressure.
17959 := So the truth is out. I never meant to kill her, you know. When I found out she was a Sith spy using me to gain information, something inside me just snapped.
17960 := She didn't know I had found out, so I waited until she fell asleep and then I... I killed her. Simple, really. But once I realized what I'd done I... I panicked. I contacted those spies from the Republic to help me.
17961 := They found the illegal monitoring device that the Sith had planted in the room, altered its recording to hide my part in it and cleared up the evidence. I figured that was the end of it.
17962 := It's easy for you to judge me - but you weren't there! You don't know what it was like, realizing what I'd done. But it...but it doesn't matter anyway.
17963 := The Sith must have been spying on me and Elassa, trying to make sure she wasn't a double agent. They must have seen the Republic spies getting rid of all the evidence.
17964 := And so they planted their own evidence. Elassa must have stolen that Hero's Cross from me long ago and given it to her Sith masters, like some kind of trophy.
17965 := I just thought I'd misplaced it. But when the Cross turned up on her body, I knew the Sith had put it there. So now you know the whole story, what are you going to do?
17966 := I'm glad you decided to see reason in this. If I'm convicted it could cause trouble for the Republic embassy here on Manaan. And none of us want that, now do we?
17967 := But Sunry is a murderer. I'm sorry, old friend, but you are. I... I can't approve of this. You go ahead, however, if that's what you think is best.
17968 := You think I'm some kind of monster, don't you? All I did was kill a Sith! How many Sith have you killed? Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands?
17969 := I don't see how the two of us are any different. She was a spy! She was using me to get information so Malak's army could destroy the Republic! She deserved to die!
17970 := If I confess I'm looking at 20 years in prison! And the Ahto City officials might even place kolto sanctions on the Republic Embassy. Without kolto how can we treat the injuries to our soldiers on the front lines!
17971 := [Failure] Oh, That's low - using a Jedi mind trick to extort a confession from me. You might as well beat it out of me, you'd have better luck!
17972 := No. I can't do that and put the Republic's supply of kolto in danger. No I won't! Now look, I may have done something stupid, and it may only be worse for my standing by it, but I will not confess.
17973 := If you turn me in, the Republic will likely lose its kolto export privileges and then we'll lose the war for sure. Are you going to send all those thousands, millions - like on Taris - to their deaths, just for your sense of 'justice'?
17974 := No, I'll rot in here if I have to, but I won't betray the Republic. Do what you have to, but know what the consequences will be.
17975 := I hate to say it, but he has a point. The Republic needs that kolto.
17976 := And you would propose what? Letting a murderer free on the chance it will help the Republic?
17977 := If need be. We are talking about a Sith, remember? I don't approve of what he did any more than you --
17978 := But you're willing to overlook it. Are the principles that the Republic stands on so very weak, Carth?
17979 := The Republic's principles aren't worth a hill of beans if it falls, Bastila. I'll do whatever I can to save it.
17980 := Sunry... this is wrong, and you know it. I am a Jedi... what is it that you expect me to do to defend your actions?
17981 := You do whatever you have to, Jolee. I know what I did, but I also know what's at stake, here.
17982 := Commentary: The meatbag has a point, master. Killing is often justified, if illegal in the eyes of many.
17983 := You're talking about acts of war. We're just defending ourselves! You murdered your girlfriend in her sleep.
17984 := That's different, Sunry, and you know it. We don't kill them in cold blood while they sleep.
17985 := A Rodian? I didn't know there were any Rodians on Manaan. Oh, except for Tyvark... and this one named Gluupor who was hanging around the hotel all the time.
17986 := OK, so maybe there are a whole bunch of Rodians on Manaan, but what does that matter? If he planted evidence at the scene it's a clear sign of a frame-up. He probably took all the evidence of the real killer at the same time.
17987 := The evidence of a Sith conspiracy keeps getting stronger, doesn't it? But I suspect there is still stuff you want to clear up. 
17988 := [Failure] That's a Sith lie! They're trying to embarrass me and humiliate my wife! How dare you ask me that!
17989 := Yes, I... I suppose you do. Please, forgive my outburst. This has been a terribly stressful time for me. I... I'm sure there is more you want to ask me.
17990 := Then... then you know. Please, don't make a big deal about this. Elora already knew and I... I was going there to break if off with Elassa.
17991 := I know it was wrong, but I'm a weak man. Elassa was beautiful and young - how was I to resist her charms? But I didn't kill her! I loved her!
17992 := Please, I know I made a terrible mistake getting involved with Elassa, but I was going there to break it off with her.
17993 := I did it, but found out later that she was dead. I don't deserve to go to jail just for having an affair, do I? You have to help me prove that I wasn't the killer!
17994 := The witnesses are lying! Maybe the Sith got to them - I don't know. But it's a lie I tell you! A hurtful, horrible lie!
17995 := [Success] We... I... Oh, no... what must this look like... Yes. Yes we were having an affair.
17996 := I guess you could interview witnesses at the hotel where the murder happened. The Selkath already did that, but the fish folk don't have much rapport with off-worlders. Maybe one of them was holding something back.
17997 := But I think you'd be better off investigating the Sith themselves. Maybe you could find some proof they planted evidence to frame me - though that might mean figuring out a way into the Sith Embassy.
17998 := Anything else I can help you with? I want my Arbiter to be well prepared before we go to trial.
17999 := Well I was at the hotel, I admit. And I did meet Elassa there that night. But it's not what you think!
18000 := I... I was working with Republic Intelligence. We were pretending to feed information to the Sith while I turned Elassa into a double agent working for us.
18001 := It was going well, too... Until she turned up dead...
18002 := Hm... maybe the Sith had found out I was turning her and had her eliminated...
18003 := But let's look at the facts they've given:
18004 := Elassa was brutally killed. Think about that - she was a Sith, trained in battle and I'm just a crippled old man!
18005 := My war injuries make it difficult for me to walk even to hold things. See how my hands are shaking! How could I kill a Sith warrior at close quarters? I ask you!
18006 := Further: They say they found my Hero's Cross at the crime scene. Would I leave my war medal behind if I killed someone? Even I'm not that stupid.
18007 := Obviously the Sith planted the Cross. And what about the lack of forensic evidence? Skin and hair samples, clothing fibers - why isn't there anything like that at the crime scene? Sounds like an obvious frame-up to me.
18008 := I hope you can see how the Sith are manipulating the Selkath, and probably even you, to set up this against me! We need to get this over with quickly and clear my name.
18009 := Well... you know I was having an affair with Elassa... I went there to break it off that night.
18010 := I can tell you it wasn't easy. She is... was... young and beautiful. But I love Elora, and I knew I had to do it. I broke it off as quickly as I could and then left.
18011 := I found out later she'd been murdered when the Selkath authorities came knocking on my door...
18012 := Jolee! What... what are you doing here?
18013 := Elora sent me, Sunry. I'm here to get you out of this mess. The courts went and made us Arbiters for your case.
18014 := Just like old times, eh Jolee? You come swooping in out of nowhere to save my tail from the fire.
18015 := You saved my wrinkled butt more than a few times as well, friend, if I recall. But there'll be time for catching up later. Right now we need to focus on the case.
18016 := Your wife asked me to come. I'm a friend of Jolee Bindo.
18017 := I've been appointed as your Arbiter.
18018 := I'll be going now.
18019 := There's a few things we have to clear up.
18020 := On second thought, I will ask something else.
18021 := The judges said that you left after the shot was fired.
18022 := I know you're guilty, Sunry. I've got the Republic's data recording.
18023 := You're nothing but a cold blooded killer!
18024 := You should have known the truth would come out eventually.
18025 := But the Sith found out the truth, didn't they?
18026 := I won't betray your secret. We'll go on with the trial.
18027 := I don't know.
18028 := You're guilty, Sunry. Confess.
18029 := If you confess the court might show mercy.
18030 := I suppose you're right. I won't expose you.
18031 := Killing your lover while she sleeps is murder - even if she is a Sith!
18032 := [Force Persuade] You will confess your crimes. You WANT to confess your crimes.
18033 := These are just excuses, Sunry. We both know you have to own up to your crimes.
18034 := There was a Rodian who planted evidence at the murder scene.
18035 := [Persuade] Were you and Elassa having an affair?
18036 := No offense, Sunry. I have to ask.
18037 := I know you're lying, Sunry. I found this datapad talking about you and Elassa.
18038 := Witnesses saw you at her hotel room, Sunry. You better tell me what's going on.
18039 := I need to investigate the case some more. Any ideas where I should look?
18040 := Let's go over the evidence.
18041 := I don't know how much longer I can stay on this world... The Selkath don't make it easy for us off-worlders.
18042 := A friend of mine recently got into Pazaak - you know, the card game. Now he can't stop! It's so addictive!
18043 := Wow! Hey, you're the sector swoop champ, right? Too bad about the circuit being so small this year, but still!
18044 := The whole swoop racing circuit for this sector has been falling apart since the Sith bombed Taris.
18045 := Did I tell you I'm a fan? I saw recordings of some of your races and you're great! Maybe when they get the circuit back up we can really see what you can do!
18046 := I hear there's going to be a heavy meteor shower in the Coruscant system this year. Last time this sort of thing happened, they lost one of the orbital stations.
18047 := I hear the Czerka Corp. got kicked off Kashyyyk by the locals... Good for them! At least someone's getting something back from them.
18048 := There's a lot of credits to be made in the Republic in times like these. If we survive of course...
18049 := The fighting between the Republic and the Sith is spreading farther. I wonder how long before Manaan becomes a battleground...
18050 := I heard someone attack and killed a lot of the Sith leadership on one of their worlds. Maybe the Republic would actually have a chance... if it weren't for Malak.
18051 := I heard the Sith are trying to work on a synthetic version of kolto. I wouldn't be surprised if the Republic was, too.
18052 := Manaan may not seem very hospitable, but a surprising amount of trade runs through it because of the kolto trade.
18053 := The Selkath have clamped down on kolto exports all of a sudden. No one knows why. If someone did something to offend them, there's going to be trouble I think.
18054 := This court hereby finds Sunry innocent of the murder of the Sith Elassa.
18055 := Your Honors! No!
18056 := Silence!
18057 := In addition, this court finds the Sith Empire guilty of conspiracy and obstruction of justice.
18058 := Your Honors! No!
18059 := Silence!
18060 := The Sith Empire is hereby forced to subsidize a portion of Republic purchases on Manaan for a period of the next solar year.
18061 := The verdict has been delivered and this trial is now over.
18062 := Sunry... I'm so glad...
18063 := Elora...
18064 := Thank you for saving me. I don't know how I can repay you. Elora and I are going to leave here and get as far away from all this as soon as we can.
18065 := I - and the Republic - will not forget what you've done for us. Thank you.
18066 := We have done all we could for you, old friend.
18067 := Thank you, Jolee! I... I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't shown up!
18068 := Don't thank me, thank your Arbiter. I was glad to help.
18069 := This court hereby finds Sunry guilty of the murder of the Sith Elassa.
18070 := According with Selkath law the proscribed punishment for murder is death.
18071 := *sob* Sunry... No...
18072 := But due to the extenuating circumstances surrounding this case...
18073 := ... and to not provoke additional tension between the Sith and Republic elements within Ahto City...
18074 := ... this sentence is commuted to a life-term in the Ahto City Prison.
18075 := No, your honors! I demand the death penalty!
18076 := You are in no position to argue, Sith! Do not think that your Empire can pressure this court! We have made our decision!
18077 := The verdict has been delivered and this trial is now over.
18078 := Remove the guilty party from this courtroom.
18079 := Sunry...
18080 := The Republic will attempt to have him freed, Elora, I am sure. This... this is the best we could do. I'm sorry.
18081 := This court hereby finds Sunry guilty of the murder of the Sith Elassa.
18082 := In accordance with Selkath law the proscribed punishment for murder is death.
18083 := The verdict has been delivered and this trial is now over.
18084 := Remove the guilty party from this courtroom.
18085 := *sob* Sunry... No...
18086 := I... I'm sorry, Sunry. And Elora. There is nothing more we can do.
18087 := The witnesses have all been called forward and questioned by both prosecution and defense. The prosecution will now present, in closing, its summary of the pertinent facts of this case.
18088 := I think the facts in this case are very straight forward: Sunry was having an affair with Elassa. He sought to end it, and the simplest, quickest method given his hatred of the Sith was to simply kill her.
18089 := *Ahem* Witnesses saw Sunry fleeing the scene, and material evidence places him there at the time of the murder as well.
18090 := I am confident that any informed observation of the facts will lead the judges - your Honors - to this very conclusion.
18091 := Indeed. And your closing statements, Arbiter?
18092 := Then the court will now deliberate amongst ourselves.
18093 := I find that highly unlikely, Arbiter. The Sith have no need of such deception. The facts speak clear.
18094 := But the Sith have been known for violence, deception, and murder before.
18095 := That is also true. Is there another point you would make?
18096 := The Sith would not leave the medal of her killer clutched in her hand!
18097 := Your time for arguments has passed, and you would do well to remember that!
18098 := The Arbiter's argument does bring up a valid point.
18099 := Is there anything else you would state?
18100 := Objection!
18101 := The Arbiter is allowed an opinion as well as you, prosecutor.
18102 := No matter how erroneous...
18103 := Or truthful.
18104 := A cripple can be just as capable as any other man. And Sunry more than most.
18105 := You overrate this man!
18106 := Perhaps. Are there any other arguments, Arbiter?
18107 := Truth.
18108 := That doesn't mean a thing! He was there, running from the room!
18109 := If you speak out of turn again, you will be forcibly ejected from the court! The Arbiter speaks a valid fact.
18110 := Is there another point you would make?
18111 := Does the prosecution have any remaining witnesses to call forth?
18112 := I wish to call forth Sunry himself, your Honors.
18113 := Very well.
18114 := Are you a war hero, Mr. Sunry? You fought in wars against the Sith Empire, correct?
18115 := Yeah, that's right. I don't regret it either. The Republic needs its heroes.
18116 := Indeed... Would you say that you dislike the Sith? Even... hate them?
18117 := Of course I hate them! Trying to take over the galaxy every chance they get! Killing millions of innocents!
18118 := Pure politics. Were you in Elassa's room on the night of the murder?
18119 := Well, yes I... I was...
18120 := I knew she was a Sith, and she would be trying to pump me - for information, of course - so I... I just simply turned the tables.
18121 := I was working on her, trying to turn her over to the Republic's side. Trying to turn her into a double agent. But that's kind of ruined now that she's been murdered.
18122 := An obviously false story! I have proof here, in the form of data recording, that proves you were, in fact, having an affair with Elassa!
18123 := Let this new evidence be entered in the court records.
18124 := So be it.
18125 := I... I... What's the use now... I had been having an affair with Elassa, it's true. But I had realized my mistake and was going there to end it! But I did not kill her!
18126 := I had been having an affair with Elassa on my wife, yes... But I realized how wrong I had been and I was going there to end it!
18127 := You were having an affair with a Sith! You wanted to end it quickly and quietly, so you killed her from behind and tried to flee!
18128 := No, I...
18129 := I think we can see the answer clear enough, Mr. Sunry!
18130 := Do not interrupt the accused!
18131 := In fact, I think you've said quite enough already, prosecutor.
18132 := Do you have any question to ask the accused, Arbiter?
18133 := Yes I think they would. They wouldn't want to lose one of their sources - even though I didn't give them anything!
18134 := They... they might have killed her for her failure... or they might have thought she'd turn against them or something like that.
18135 := The Sith Empire is not the barbaric institution you portray it to be!
18136 := Be silent, prosecutor. This is a valuable point, that lends some credence to your defense, Arbiter.
18137 := I don't know. The medal had gone missing some time ago. I never found out what happened to it.
18138 := It's possible the Sith had stolen it and had it planted on the body...
18139 := Supposition, your Honors!
18140 := True, but it does have merit and deserves consideration.
18141 := Of course she was! Why would a young, beautiful Sith woman get with an old cripple like me?
18142 := You are not helping yourself, Sunry. You only give reason why you might kill her.
18143 := He merely states facts. The incompetence of the murder indicates that her occupation was not the motive for the killing.
18144 := The fact remains: Elassa was a Sith and likely a spy as well.
18145 := Is there anything else you wish to ask the accused?
18146 := Will you use this opportunity to poll the judges?
18147 := I do not have enough information to make an informed decision.
18148 := I think that Sunry could not have committed this crime.
18149 := I am unsure as yet as to whether Sunry was the actual murderer.
18150 := Sunry perhaps was not the killer.
18151 := I cannot make my decision on what I have yet seen.
18152 := Sunry did not have the capacity to commit these murders... I think.
18153 := I just do not have enough information to judge this case yet.
18154 := I do not believe Sunry, as a well-standing Republic citizen, could have committed this crime.
18155 := I cannot tell yet if Sunry killed Elassa, but I am confident it will be proven.
18156 := Perhaps I was wrong, after all, in my thoughts about Sunry.
18157 := Sunry is obviously guilty of killing the Sith woman.
18158 := Despite his honorable past, Sunry would seem to have done something deplorable.
18159 := It seems to me that the evidence is weighted against Sunry.
18160 := I think that Sunry was perfectly capable of committing this crime.
18161 := I think that Sunry, perhaps, could have been the culprit.
18162 := If the defense has no more questions, the court will call out Elora, Sunry's wife.
18163 := You Elora, are Sunry's lawful wife. Your husband was a hero in the last war between the Sith Empire and the Republic.
18164 := He was crippled in that war. Do you not believe he'd blame the Sith for his injury?
18165 := Yes, I guess he would.
18166 := And there you have motive! Sunry seeks revenge on the Sith for what they did him and killed Elassa.
18167 := A supposition for now, prosecutor. Does the defense have any questions for the witness?
18168 := Yes. He fought against the Sith in the last war. He fought bravely and was even awarded the Hero's Cross!
18169 := I don't know how much that means to the Sith or to your Selkath, your Honors, but in the Republic it is awarded only to the bravest, most valorous, most honorable men.
18170 := The kind of man who earns that medal would not kill someone in cold blood!
18171 := Your husband earned a medal because he excelled at killing Sith. It relates directly.
18172 := Do not let personal opinions sway your judgment of the law!
18173 := He was a good man, but his injuries pained him terribly. But he always held on. Always persevered.
18174 := I don't think he could have beaten her or anything like that... but a blaster? I just don't know...
18175 := Sunry seems fully capable to me. But it seems unlikely that he would choose to do such a thing.
18176 := Yes... Yes it was true. He was having an affair with that Sith harlot.
18177 := It seems painfully obvious that he killed her to keep quiet about the affair.
18178 := Be silent! You have already questioned the witness, prosecutor.
18179 := He had been seeing her for some time, I think. *sniff* But he said he was going to change!
18180 := He had gone there that night to end it! We talked the night before and he had promised!
18181 := But now things have become so very complicated...
18182 := That is very enlightening evidence. It will influence our deliberation considerably.
18183 := Do you have any more questions, Arbiter?
18184 := Will you use this opportunity to poll the judges?
18185 := I do not have enough information to make an informed decision.
18186 := I think that Sunry could not have committed this crime.
18187 := I am unsure as yet as to whether Sunry was the actual murderer.
18188 := Sunry perhaps was not the killer.
18189 := I cannot make my decision on what I have yet seen.
18190 := Sunry did not have the capacity to commit these murders... I think.
18191 := I just do not have enough information to judge this case yet.
18192 := I do not believe Sunry, as a well-standing Republic citizen, could have committed this crime.
18193 := I cannot tell yet if Sunry killed Elassa, but I am confident it will be proven.
18194 := Perhaps I was wrong, after all, in my thoughts about Sunry.
18195 := Sunry is obviously guilty of killing the Sith woman.
18196 := Despite his honorable past, Sunry would seem to have done something deplorable.
18197 := It seems to me that the evidence is weighted against Sunry.
18198 := I think that Sunry was perfectly capable of committing this crime.
18199 := I think that Sunry, perhaps, could have been the culprit.
18200 := Since the defense has no further questions, we will call out the second witness: the Rodian Gluupor.
18201 := The prosecution may question the witness.
18202 := Gluupor the Rodian, you were staying in the hotel the night of the murder and saw Sunry leaving Elassa's room didn't you?
18203 := Yes, Gluupor see Sunry running down hallway, and when Gluupor look in room, Sith woman dead on floor.
18204 := This is clear then: that Sunry left the room with the Sith Elassa already dead behind him.
18205 := Perhaps, Sith, perhaps. It is the turn of the defense to question the witness now.
18206 := Gluupor... Gluupor...
18207 := Don't do it, Gluupor...
18208 := The prosecution will be silent!
18209 := What is it you wish to say Gluupor?
18210 := Gluupor... Gluupor paid by Sith to plant that medal.
18211 := Lies! Slander! I object!
18212 := You are certain of this Gluupor?
18213 := Gluupor certain...
18214 := This new evidence puts the entire case in a new light.
18215 := Sunry seems like strong man, but he is hurt, too.
18216 := Gluupor not think that man like that would stand up to a Sith. Not at all. But Sunry still run fast after.
18217 := We know full well the extend of Sunry's injuries, Arbiter!
18218 := But the fact still remains.
18219 := Gluupor not know. Why anyone leave things in someone else's room?
18220 := Gluupor just think these things happen. It is just... odd...
18221 := Yes. Odd indeed.
18222 := Gluupor... Gluupor not see Sunry really hurt Sith... But Gluupor did see Sunry leaving room with dead Sith in it!
18223 := But... Gluupor not see him really kill Sith...
18224 := An important distinction Arbiter.
18225 := Do you wish to ask the witness anything else?
18226 := Would you like to poll the judges at this time?
18227 := I do not have enough information to make an informed decision.
18228 := I think that Sunry could not have committed this crime.
18229 := I am unsure as yet as to whether Sunry was the actual murderer.
18230 := Sunry perhaps was not the killer.
18231 := I cannot make my decision on what I have yet seen.
18232 := Sunry did not have the capacity to commit these murders... I think.
18233 := I just do not have enough information to judge this case yet.
18234 := I do not believe Sunry, as a well-standing Republic citizen, could have committed this crime.
18235 := I cannot tell yet if Sunry killed Elassa, but I am confident it will be proven.
18236 := Perhaps I was wrong, after all, in my thoughts about Sunry.
18237 := Sunry is obviously guilty of killing the Sith woman.
18238 := Despite his honorable past, Sunry would seem to have done something deplorable.
18239 := It seems to me that the evidence is weighted against Sunry.
18240 := I think that Sunry was perfectly capable of committing this crime.
18241 := I think that Sunry, perhaps, could have been the culprit.
18242 := We will now begin by calling forth the witnesses to the crime and taking their testimony.
18243 := After each witness has given their testimony and you have cross-examined them, you may ask the presiding judges for their opinions on the current state of the case. This is a special privilege given by Manaan law only to the defendant, so use it wisely.
18244 := The first witness is Firith. The prosecution will question the witness first.
18245 := You are Firith Me, the well-known Pazaak player. I wonder if we can trust the word of a gambler as reliable testimony...
18246 := Objection sustained. Ask the witness your questions and do it promply.
18247 := Of course, your Honor.
18248 := Firith: what did you see the night of the murder?
18249 := I came out into the hallway after hearing the blaster shot and saw Sunry over there limping down the hall out of the building.
18250 := Heh. A very obvious point, your Honors. The accused was seen leaving the scene of the crime after the blaster that killed Elassa was fired.
18251 := A very pertinent point, prosecutor.
18252 := It is now the defense's turn to cross-examine the witness.
18253 := Yes, from what I could tell. She carried a lightsaber around under that cloak of hers.
18254 := Objection! That doesn't prove she was a Jedi!
18255 := No, this piece of evidence is very important. It establishes the character of Elassa and perhaps her intent in dealing with Sunry.
18256 := Well he was moving pretty fast running away... but yeah, I mean, how could he kill a Sith warrior in combat? I don't know for sure...
18257 := Do not think less of Sunry because of his handicap. He is fully capable.
18258 := Can't you see that the man can hardly walk, let alone fight Elassa?
18259 := That is enough for now. We will deliberate on this later in private.
18260 := I think it may have been. I mean, you'd have to pretty stupid to leave something that important lying around, wouldn't you?
18261 := This argument has merit.
18262 := You mean actually see him kill her with my own eyes? Well... no... But I don't think there could have been anyone else there.
18263 := Your point is well-taken Arbiter.
18264 := Do you have additional questions?
18265 := Very well. Would you like to use this opportunity to poll the judges?
18266 := I do not have enough information to make an informed decision.
18267 := I think that Sunry could not have committed this crime.
18268 := I am unsure as yet as to whether Sunry was the actual murderer.
18269 := Sunry perhaps was not the killer.
18270 := I cannot make my decision on what I have yet seen.
18271 := Sunry did not have the capacity to commit these murders... I think.
18272 := I just do not have enough information to judge this case yet.
18273 := I do not believe Sunry, as a well-standing Republic citizen, could have committed this crime.
18274 := I cannot tell yet if Sunry killed Elassa, but I am confident it will be proven.
18275 := Perhaps I was wrong, after all, in my thoughts about Sunry.
18276 := Sunry is obviously guilty of killing the Sith woman.
18277 := Despite his honorable past, Sunry would seem to have done something deplorable.
18278 := It seems to me that the evidence is weighted against Sunry.
18279 := I think that Sunry was perfectly capable of committing this crime.
18280 := I think that Sunry, perhaps, could have been the culprit.
18281 := The first matter of business is the presentation of a sworn testimony by the proprietor - Ignus - of the hotel where the murder occurred. What is the testimony you wish to give us?
18282 := The man I saw leaving - Sunry - probably left after I heard the blaster shot.
18283 := The guilt of the accused is apparent even this early in the trial.
18284 := Know your place, Sith!
18285 := This is important evidence. The court will keep this in mind near the top of the list of pertinent facts.
18286 := The man I saw leaving - Sunry - left before I heard the blaster shot.
18287 := Impossible!
18288 := Know your place, Sith!
18289 := This is serious evidence indeed. The court will keep this in mind near the top of the list of pertinent facts.
18290 := Let the record show that the trial of Sunry vs. the Ahto City Authority has commenced. Presiding are judges Shelkar...
18291 := Jhosa...
18292 := Naleshekan...
18293 := Kota...
18294 := and Duula.
18295 := This trial is to determine the culpability of Sunry in the death of the Sith Elassa.
18296 := Representing Sunry in his defense is a member of the Jedi Order. Do you have any opening statements?
18297 := Acting as a prosecutor for the Ahto City Authority is an impartial observer from the Sith Empire.
18298 := It is an honor to see justice served.
18299 := And I will see Sunry is executed for the crime he has committed.
18300 := Do not be too overzealous in pressing your commission, Sith!
18301 := That remains to be seen.
18302 := [Failure] You are in no position to tell us how to judge our laws!
18303 := We know of your Order, Jedi. We know that you have powers to manipulate the minds of lesser creatures.
18304 := Do not think that we Selkath, the pinnacle of evolution, can be swayed by such means!
18305 := If you attempt such manipulations again, Sunry will be found guilty, and you will summarily be put to death! We do not tolerate intrusions upon the justice of our courts!
18306 := A recording? Let this new evidence be entered in the records.
18307 := Ah... this new evidence is most convincing.
18308 := Yes. Yes it seems to be.
18309 := This shortens the trial considerably. In light of this new evidence there is no need to proceed with the witnesses or cross-examinations.
18310 := No! You traitor!
18311 := Sunry! No!
18312 := Your client is guilty, Arbiter? Are you sure you wish to enter this plea?
18313 := Honesty is an attribute essential to the position of Arbiter, as is impartiality. It would not be advised for you to abuse either of these.
18314 := Do not mock us, Jedi!
18315 := Enough! This case will proceed on schedule.
18316 := No! I object! I am the victim of a conspiracy here!
18317 := Is this true Arbiter? Your client does not seem to agree with your assertations.
18318 := The position of Arbiter is to defend your client. Therefore, inspite of your personal feelings, you must do so to the best of your ability.
18319 := This trial will proceed on schedule.
18320 := My arguments are complete.
18321 := Elassa was a spy and the Sith are framing Sunry.
18322 := Sunry was ending the affair, so the Sith killed her.
18323 := The Sith are obviously evil and set this up.
18324 := Sunry was a cripple and couldn't have killed her.
18325 := No one actually witnessed the murder.
18326 := You were going there to end the affair. Would the Sith object?
18327 := How could Elassa have got ahold of your medal?
18328 := Elassa was a Sith spy, wasn't she?
18329 := I have no additional questions.
18330 := No.
18331 := Yes.
18332 := Sunry was a Republic war hero, wasn't he?
18333 := Sunry was a cripple. Could he have killed Elassa?
18334 := Was it true your husband was having an affair with Elassa?
18335 := I have no additional questions.
18336 := No.
18337 := Yes.
18338 := Did you plant the medal on Elassa?
18339 := Do you really think a cripple could have hurt Elassa?
18340 := Isn't the medal at the crime scene too obvious a clue?
18341 := Did you see Sunry kill Elassa?
18342 := I have no additional questions.
18343 := No.
18344 := Yes.
18345 := Do not undermine the witness!
18346 := Objection, your Honors!
18347 := Elassa is a Dark Jedi, isn't she?
18348 := How could Sunry have harmed her if he was a cripple?
18349 := Was the medal left at the crime scene not a little too obvious?
18350 := Did you actually see the murder happen?
18351 := I have no additional questions.
18352 := No.
18353 := Yes.
18354 := I have no comments at this time.
18355 := I will find Sunry innocent.
18356 := [Force Persuade] You will find Sunry innocent.
18357 := Sunry is guilty of the murder. I have this recording as proof.
18358 := Sunry is guilty of the murder. He has confessed to me.
18359 := I have reconsidered.
18360 := I do.
18361 := Oh, you're back. You going to stick around this time? Or did I offend you?
18362 := I think I was a little drunk there earlier, but I'm better now. This Selkath brew wears off pretty fast.
18363 := I probably should cut back on the drinking, but it's a good way to relax. There's a lot of tension here on Manaan.
18364 := Oh... head hurts... eyes bleary... must get back to embassy... find bed.
18365 := (Snore)... (snort, snuffle)... (burp)... (snore).
18366 := (You find 10 credits and an access card for the Sith Base.)
18367 := You find nothing of value.
18368 := (snort, gurgle) Lemme shleep... (burp, snort)... (snore)
18369 := Well, mish... I fear I am good and truly drunk. But don't let my inebriashion fool you... you are shtill a gorgeush creature. (hic) 
18370 := Perhapsh we should make our acquaintensh more intimate. I know a little motel jus' around the corner... (burp) 'schuse me, mish.
18371 := Who knows? Who cares? Bad enough them Selkath punks are running around our bashe, making it shtink like fish!.
18372 := Shunry... he's goin' away for a loooong time. We Shith made sure of that.
18373 := Jus' rumors. Shtuff I heard about making sure them shtupid fish people find the evidence they need.
18374 := I don't wanna talk about that shtuff no more. Why don't we shlip away together, darling?
18375 := Dunno what yer talkin' about... Mmmm, but you don't need a map to get what I can give ya!
18376 := Yesh! One more drink! Jus' what I wash thinking!
18377 := Say, you must be new around here. My name is Viglo. You don't look like those Republic scum, and you aren't one of us Sith. So, what brings you to Manaan?
18378 := Oh... I get it. I get a little too forward and you want to hold it against me. 
18379 := Hey, I just thought of something! If I said you had a great body, would you hold it against me? Ha ha ha!
18380 := Barkeep, I sense I've offended my lady friend. Bring me another round so I can drown my sorrows in the sweet nectar of the Selkath people.
18381 := We Sith are interested in lots of stuff. You'd be smart to keep your nose out of Sith business.
18382 := I hope the Selkath fry that Sunry for what he did. Elassa was a real looker, and nobody kills a Sith and gets away with it!
18383 := You some kind of historian? You should look to the future, not the past. That's why I joined the Sith. And then I get stuck on Manaan - worst post in the galaxy!
18384 := It isn't easy here, you know. Not with all the Republic soldiers walking the streets while we sit and do nothing. Malak should send a fleet in and conquer this whole sector, kolto or no!
18385 := But I don't really want to talk about that right now. I'm just here to have a couple drinks and try to unwind, you know?
18386 := Sure, pull up a seat. I'll have the bartender ring us up a couple mugs of the local favorite. It's called a firaxian tooth.
18387 := Watch out for these - they pack quite the bite. Two or three of these babies and you won't even remember who you are.
18388 := Whoa - that's good stuff! Maybe even better than Kessel spice, am I right?
18389 := Sure - fire away. It's the least I can do after you bought me a drink and all.
18390 := Aw, you want to talk business? I was hoping you wanted to ask something more... you know, personal. Look, I don't want to talk shop. I just want to relax with my drink... which is, unfortunately, empty now.
18391 := I better take it easy - I've got a shift tomorrow and I don't want to end up passed out on the floor.
18392 := [Success] I suppose one more wouldn't hurt. Barkeep, ring up another round!
18393 := [Success] I suppose one more wouldn't hurt. Barkeep, ring up another round!
18394 := [Failure] I better not. You don't even want to know what the punishment is if one of us Sith shows up for a shift drunk or hungover.
18395 := [Success] I suppose one more wouldn't hurt. Barkeep, ring up another round!
18396 := Oh, that's good stuff. Really takes the edge off, know what I mean? Whoa, feeling a little light-headed, there. 
18397 := Firaxian Tooth - almost as valuable as kolto, right? Ha ha ha! I gotta get this recipe someday. Wonder if I can brew it up right at home? What do you think is in this stuff, anyway? 
18398 := One more, barkeep! Hurry up, man - this stuff is powerful quick, but it wears off just as fast!
18399 := As long as it's not about Sith business, the answer is yes, sweetie! Yes to another round, yes to I think you're gorgeous and yes to anything you want to do together!
18400 := Well, you picked a real stinkhole to stop at. Republic soldiers are everywhere, those arrogant Selkath treating us Sith like we're second-class citizens.
18401 := I wish we could bomb this ocean world into a desert, but we need that kolto for our Sith troops. Man, I hate this place.
18402 := Some of the other soldiers like to go and bet on the swoops on their days off, but this planet is bad enough without mingling with the locals.
18403 := Hey, man, clear out. You're cramping my style with the ladies.
18404 := Rifle through Viglo's wallet.
18405 := Hey, wake up! I need to ask you some questions.
18406 := Why have the Sith taken such an interest in the Selkath youth?
18407 := Do you know anything about Sunry?
18408 := What are you talking about?
18409 := What do you know about a Star Map?
18410 := Maybe you need another drink.
18411 := I'll be going now.
18412 := Why are the Sith so interested in the Selkath youth?
18413 := I'm investigating the recent murder.
18414 := I'm searching for some ancient ruins, or maybe a long forgotten Star Map.
18415 := Mind if I join you? The next round's on me.
18416 := Mind if I ask you some questions?
18417 := Why are the Sith so interested in the Selkath youth?
18418 := Can you tell me anything about the recent murder?
18419 := Do you know about an ancient Star Map?
18420 := Want another one? My treat.
18421 := [Persuade] Huh... I thought you Sith soldiers knew how to handle your drinks. Guess I was wrong.
18422 := [Persuade] Just one more. It'll help you unwind.
18423 := [Force Persuade] Another one won't hurt.
18424 := Now you're starting to relax. Want another one?
18425 := Can I ask you some questions now?
18426 := Let's get you one more round.
18427 := I'm just passing through.
18428 := I'm <FullName>. I'm just here to check out the swoop races.
18429 := Sorry, if I stand still for even a moment one of these mercs will have his hands where they don't belong.
18430 := Can't stop now - busy, busy, busy!
18431 := These mercenaries are running me off my feet! Talk to the bartender if you want something.
18432 := Hey, I saw you at the swoop races! I wish I had time to talk, but these mercs keep my pretty busy.
18433 := Hey, I know you - you're that famous Pazaak player! If I wasn't so busy I'd get your autoprint!
18434 := I heard they found Sunry guilty of murder. Good - he got what he deserved, cheating on his wife and all!
18435 := I hear the murder trial is over. Guess that Sunry guy was innocent after all. I'm glad to see he got off.
18436 := Someone told me the Sith destroyed Taris. The whole planet is nothing but rubble. Can you even imagine something so awful?
18437 := I heard the Republic are the cause of the kolto shortage. I wonder if it's true?

18534 := You're really annoying, you know that? I hate it when people come out of nowhere and start collecting wins.
18535 := So, you're trying to break out of the low rounds, hmm? Don't let your one win go to your head. Hukta and I are professionals. 
18536 := Don't expect a warm "Hello" from me, I don't have much warmth for the racer that outranked me in my round.
18537 := Well, hello Sector Champion. You must be proud right now. You'll excuse me if I don't join in with cheers of my own.
18538 := What do you want now? I really don't have time for you.
18539 := What do you want? I don't waste time with fans, so if this is about an autoprint, forget it. You can buy one when I get more made up.
18540 := Leave me alone. I need time to prepare for my races.
18541 := What? Are you threatening me? On Manaan? You know how foolish that is, right?
18542 := That's better. Hurry up and tell me what you want.
18543 := Not here you won't. There are cameras everywhere, looking for just your type. Criminals like you are shipped off instantly.
18544 := You're not getting anything out of me on this planet. The Selkath have cameras everywhere. You'd just be locked up for trying.
18545 := Go away. Manaan isn't very friendly to bullies.
18546 := Don't get snippy with me. I have legions of adoring fans that would rather have my time. Legions!
18547 := Well, get it over with.
18548 := Don't hurry back.
18549 := I know that if you do absolutely anything wrong you get locked up. Seems like fining criminals is a great way to bring in the credits.
18550 := I'm surprised they even let us race. Wouldn't want the crowds to get too excited. Excitement make people unpredictable. Or something.
18551 := Again? Oh all right, but only if you make it quick.
18552 := Of course you do. Everyone wants time with the fabulous Casandra Mateil. There just isn't enough of me to go around.
18553 := Yes yes, hurry it up.
18554 := Hukta Jax is the only other professional here besides me. He got where he is by making sure everyone knows he's the toughest racer out there.
18555 := I don't know any of the other racers. I guess there's Queedle, the local favorite. He won't amount to much.
18556 := You need money to compete. Maybe he's got some skills, but he just doesn't have the best bike. It's that simple.
18557 := The only other name I know is Queedle. You heard about him taking it all, right? I don't know where he got the speed from.
18558 := I don't need to tell you anything. You've beat us all. You're just looking for an excuse to gloat.
18559 := Two years, but that's more than enough time to know the secrets behind the sport. It's all about the image you portray.
18560 := Hukta is the thug; people like him because he's mean. I'm the pretty one; the one that people want to take home.
18561 := Even if we don't win, we're easy to remember. That keeps the fans coming back, so race organizers want us at their tracks.
18562 := Local racers don't bring in off-world crowds. They need us. At least, they would if there was still a functioning circuit.
18563 := It was, but I can't seem to get a break lately. Hukta has been holding me off, and all he does is run over everything.
18564 := But this place is all there is until the circuit recovers from the loss of Taris. It's going to take a while.
18565 := Not within reasonable traveling time. I heard there was a start-up on Tatooine, but I'll stick with the legitimate tracks, thank you very much.
18566 := Hutts aren't to be trusted. That's all I'll say.
18567 := And of course you had to go and take the whole competition. Nothing like getting beaten by a rookie.
18568 := And Queedle, what's he doing winning? He's just a local amateur. I'm glad only a small crowd saw him blow past me.
18569 := You should know better than any of us. You're the Sector Champion, after all. You tell me if the track is good. Feh!
18570 := Wait, you're that new racer. I don't give out racing secrets, if that's what you're asking for.
18571 := I'm still upset about losing my ranking to that amateur Queedle. I don't know how he got so fast all of a sudden.
18572 := Wait a minute... you're no fan. You're the racer that killed my time. Why should I talk to you?
18573 := Wait, no, you're the new Sector Champion, aren't you? You're really cutting into my profits. What do you want?
18574 := I don't care who you are or what you do on this track; I'm not saying anything else to you.
18575 := Sounds like you need a lesson...
18576 := I apologize. I didn't mean anything.
18577 := I'll threaten you if I want!
18578 := How about you pay me to go away?
18579 := Save your attitude. Answer my questions.
18580 := I just want to ask a few questions.
18581 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
18582 := Do you know much about Manaan?
18583 := I want to ask about you and racing.
18584 := Let's go back to my first questions.
18585 := Can you tell me about the other racers?
18586 := What makes you say that?
18587 := How long have you been at this?
18588 := What do you mean by that?
18589 := Is Manaan a good course for racing?
18590 := There are no other tracks?
18591 := What do you mean by that?
18592 := You don't need to talk to me, racer. I get enough of you on the track. I see you getting wins. Go away.
18593 := You got one race, but that means nothing. Go bother another beginner or something, because you are no interest to me.
18594 := Go away. You and me, we don't have anything to say about nothing. Go beat someone else's time or something.
18595 := Grrr... Sector Champion. Well, that is very nice. Now how about you go away? I got to work on waterproofing my swoop.
18596 := What do you want from Hukta now? I don't have time for you or anyone.
18597 := Who is you? Hmm? Hukta Jax -that's me- says you should step back, because pro racers like me are important.
18598 := So, you leave me alone so's I can get race-ready. It important. Meditation and stuff.
18599 := Haw! That's funny! You is new here, so maybe you don't know, but Manaan gots Selkath cameras everywhere. No fighting allowed.
18600 := You got to be smart, and know the place good. You is too new for that. You just funny.
18601 := Heh, okay, I will answer, but you watch what you say. Hukta Jax don't take threats from nobody.
18602 := Yeah, okay, but you keep it short. I got no reason to talk to you.
18603 := Yeah, you go then, and leave me alone.
18604 := I know that if you do absolutely anything wrong you get locked up. Seems like fining criminals is a great way to bring in the credits.
18605 := I'm surprised they even let us race. Wouldn't want the crowds to get too excited. Excitement make people unpredictable. Or something.
18606 := What? Again? Ask and leave me alone.
18607 := Okay, maybe I say something, or maybe not. Hukta Jax don't give secrets out.
18608 := Why? You sure talk when you get going. Maybe we can hurry up and stop soon?
18609 := I just know that I am better than all the rest. I'd be better even with more pros here. Casandra is okay, but she is weak and little.
18610 := Queedle is here too, but he doesn't got what we got.
18611 := He doesn't have the best swoop. He can have skills all over the floor, but if his swoop goes slow, he goes slow, and he goes slow.
18612 := There's Queedle too, but he is the worst! I mean, what is he doing winning it all? That is just not right! He's not pro!
18613 := You don't need nothing. You beat everybody. I got nothing to tell.
18614 := Lots of years. I got my swoop after we raided... I mean, I got my swoop when someone left it to me. It was sad, but happy too.
18615 := Nothing, and I 'm not saying any more.
18616 := This track is pretty good. It's too wet, but it's on the ocean, so you're gonna have that. Better to hit waves than rocks, I guess.
18617 := This track is all there is until the circuit is up again. Taris took the best racers. I suppose there is Tatooine...
18618 := I'm not going back to Tatooine ever. Hukta Jax is better than that dust ball.
18619 := That's none of yous business, and you stop asking about it. You stop!
18620 := I don't like you much, either. You come in and win everything from everybody, but you aren't a pro like me. It's not right.
18621 := I don't like the new racers here, though. Queedle stole the top round from me! How'd he get so fast so all of a sudden? 
18622 := What is I going to tell you about this course? You won it already! Go let someone ask you questions instead.
18623 := You that new racer, winning from nowhere, right? I like winning, so you just stay away from my times.
18624 := Queedle is the big winner right now. I hate that. He should stay in the beginner races. He's not ready to beat me. It's not right.
18625 := Wait! You's the one that beat my time! Twice I get beaten, by Queedle and you too! This is the worst showing I had yet!
18626 := You're Sector Champion, right? You only won because I gots distracted by stupid Queedle. He blew my whole strategy.
18627 := Yeah, you come talk to me. I got something to say to you, little racer. Hukta Jax doesn't like how fast you go.
18628 := I told you once already, and I want you to remember; you don't win the Sector Champion spot. If you do, there will be trouble.
18629 := See, back when more people raced, I lost lots more. Now, I win pretty good. I like winning. You maybe shouldn't mess it up.
18630 := So I says this, and you listen good. You don't win the Sector Champion race. If you win, maybe something bad happens to you. 
18631 := I already did it, and I don't regret nothing. You don't know how much I like to race. You don't know what I can do.
18632 := You just do as I says and you will stay safe. It's simple.
18633 := I am too smart to do something out in the open. Selkath gots cameras all over, and they lock everyone up without questions.
18634 := No, I would find you when you don't know it's coming, where no cameras are. You win Sector Champion race, and I hurt you.
18635 := Maybe you end up dead first. Maybe it will be painful, too. I don't like when people don't do what they should. You win and you get hurt.
18636 := Sure, you think. While you do that, stay away from the course. I's can make things very bad for you.
18637 := Then you is smarter than you look. I likes it when people are reasonable. Just stay away from the track.
18638 := Then you and Hukta Jax are gonna have problems, I promise you that. You was warned, fair and square.
18639 := Sure, you can agree with me. That's the only way this is gonna work, you understand? You do like I say, and you don't get hurt.
18640 := Hukta says you earned a big enemy. You should have lost when you was told to lose! Now something's gotta be done!
18641 := Not here, because Selkath cameras are watching. I's too smart for that. I get you when you least expect. You just wait. 
18642 := You'd better show me some respect, piggie.
18643 := Just answer my questions, and make it quick.
18644 := I just want to ask a few questions.
18645 := I'm leaving. Goodbye.
18646 := Do you know much about Manaan?
18647 := I want to ask about you and racing.
18648 := Let's go back to my first questions.
18649 := What can you tell me about the other racers?
18650 := What do you mean?
18651 := How long have you been at this?
18652 := What do you mean by that?
18653 := Is Manaan a good course for racing?
18654 := What's wrong with Tatooine?
18655 := When were you there?
18656 := You'd regret threatening me, piggie.
18657 := You'd never get away with it. Cameras are everywhere.
18658 := Try anything and you'll end up dead!
18659 := I'll think about what you said.
18660 := I don't want any trouble...
18661 := I will race, and I will win.
18662 := Can't we come to an agreement?
18663 := Sorry, but you're too late to recruit me. I've just hired on with the Sith. Of course, if the Republic has a better offer...
18664 := I don't have time to sit here and answer your questions. I have to get ready - the Sith want me to report to their Embassy first thing tomorrow.
18665 := Hey, keep your lectures. The Sith pay well, and they pay up front. That's all I care about.
18666 := Then why are you bothering me? I'm here on Manaan to find work as a mercenary. I'm not here to chat with tourists.
18667 := Can I ask you a few questions.
18668 := You'd work for the Sith? They're evil!
18669 := I'm not a recruiter.
18670 := Hello again. There's not much happening here yet. I guess the racers are waiting for the field to fill out a bit.
18671 := I appreciate the money you gave me to upgrade my swoop. Come back to East Ahto in a day or so and I'll see if my times can improve.
18672 := I'm just waiting for my time to fall. I just can't seem to keep up with the serious racers.
18673 := Hello again. I still can't believe the difference a few upgrades make. My score is top of Round Three! I never thought I'd be able to do that.
18674 := I'm sure it won't stand as a record for long, but I have to thank you for this opportunity. I appreciate all that you did for me.
18675 := Greetings to you, Sector Champion. That was an amazing time you turned in. The best I've seen on this track.
18676 := I don't feel bad losing to you, now that I know I'm in the running. Thanks for your help, even if you did win it all in the end.
18677 := Before I go any further, though, I have to return the money you gave me. The prize I won covered most of it.
18678 := What? Now listen, I want to be grateful to you for this. Don't spoil it. Just take your money back and let's stay on good terms.
18679 := There's nothing else to pay! My prize money only covered maintenance and the upgrade cost. I told you I didn't have a lot.
18680 := You know, you gave me a chance, but I guess it was all just a trick to try and get more money. Well it won't work, not on Manaan.
18681 := You can't do anything because of all the cameras. I'm not wasting time with you. I have a swoop career to plan.
18682 := I'll do my best. I owe you a lot.
18683 := You did? I didn't. I was worried the whole time. I didn't believe it until I heard my time. Thank you again for all of this..
18684 := Thanks, but no, I won't need it. I'll do all right now that I have a chance.
18685 := Hello there. You probably want to talk to the professional racers. They are in the Racers' Lounge, the room just to the east.
18686 := They don't usually associate with amateur racers like me. I'll probably be giving up soon anyway.
18687 := What? That was a bit harsh. I just can't maintain my swoop the way they can. Is that my fault?
18688 := All right, I'll answer. I probably won't be racing again anyway.
18689 := Well, I'll just keep to myself then. You can go keep company with the other elite if you want. You deserve each other.
18690 := Now go away. I've got important things to think about.
18691 := All right, but there's no need to be so rude. I just have I've important decisions on my mind.
18692 := I'll answer what I can. I don't think I'll be going back out on the track.
18693 := See you around the track.
18694 := Well, I've lived here for more than ten years. I worked in the big purification and processing plants here after leaving my homeworld of Ando.
18695 := In all that time, I've learned very little about the Selkath and their way of life. They don't like off-worlders much, even if their politics are neutral.
18696 := I can't get used to the Sith presence here, but everyone is interested in Manaan to some degree. It's all because of the kolto.
18697 := No, but it's unnerving to have them here, especially after what happened on Taris. The swoop circuit was really hurt by that, I'm sure you know.
18698 := I know that you need it to make medpacs, and I know Mannan is the only place to get it. That's all anyone knows, I think.
18699 := I'm not sure why you would be interested in going over this again. I'm just a failing amateur swoop racer.
18700 := Me? No one is interested in me. I'm just Queedle Molto, one of many failing amateur swoop racers.
18701 := If you like. I probably won't be going back out on the track soon anyway.
18702 := All right, but don't take too long. I want to get my swoop upgrade done soon, so it'll be ready when you come back to East Ahto.
18703 := Anything you like. You helped me more than enough.
18704 := Hukta Jax and Casandra Mateil are the only two professionals here right now. They keep to themselves in the Racers' Lounge.
18705 := The only thing I can really say about them is that I'll never get close to beating them. I should probably just give up racing.
18706 := I can tell you I never thought I would beat them. I doubt that Casandra and Hukta like that I've won Round Three.
18707 := I hope that will just turn to friendly rivalry. I think I can make a go of professional swoop racing after all, thanks to you.
18708 := You understand everyone enough to beat their times. That's probably more than I could tell you. I'm learning though, and I'll get even better.
18709 := Thanks again for your help. I appreciate it.
18710 := Not long, but I don't know how much more time I'll be putting in. I think I've gone as far as I can go.
18711 := I'll see if putting the credits you gave me into swoop upgrades will help, but I don't know if it will. I may just not be good enough.
18712 := I guess I'll know when I get my bike upgraded. That will take a little while, so check with me when you come back to East Ahto.
18713 := Thanks for your help either way. I mean it.
18714 := I'm not getting any better out there. I race hard, and I think I have good skills, but I just can't afford to keep up with the professionals.
18715 := Their swoop bikes are modified with the best equipment. There is only so much you can do with a borrowed toolkit and standard parts.
18716 := I can't afford to make this my life. I want to keep going, but without money, you don't win, and if you don't win, you don't get money.
18717 := I am no beggar! You asked what was troubling me and I told you. The 500 credits I need is my problem, not yours.
18718 := I'm not asking for anything. You asked what was wrong and I'm telling you. The 500 credits I need is my problem, not yours.
18719 := It's not your problem to worry about. I shouldn't even be bothering you with this. The 500 credits I need is my problem, not yours.
18720 := That's the attitude of the professional racers too. Survival of the fittest, I guess. I'll probably quit when my Round One time gets beat.
18721 := I saved all my wages from the processing plant to buy my swoop in the first place. I just don't have anything to spare. 
18722 := That's nice of you to say, but it doesn't change anything. I'll probably end up quitting as soon as someone beats my time.
18723 := You're just giving me 500 credits? Just like that? I don't know what to say. I'd have to save for months to get anywhere near that much.
18724 := Thank you. I mean it. I'll get them working on my swoop right away. Maybe I can improve on my Round One time after all.
18725 := Come back to East Ahto in a day or so, after the changes are made. I hope it helps. Maybe I'm just not good enough. I guess we'll see.
18726 := Not long at all, but I guess I'll be able to try and make it a career now. This was a big step for me. Thanks for your help.
18727 := I don't know. It's been hard to keep up with the professional racers. Maybe it's the course, or maybe it's me. I'm not doing very well.
18728 := I haven't raced anywhere else, but I'd probably do just as bad on another track. 
18729 := I didn't think so before, but thanks to you, I made it to the top round of racing. I guess the course is all right after all.
18730 := I think you answered your own question by becoming Sector Champion. It's obviously a good place for you to race. Me too, I guess.
18731 := I was worried it was too hard to get ahead on this course, but your help made me realize I just needed a little boost. Thanks again.
18732 := What else can I tell you? You're Sector Champion now. You've shown you know more than I could tell you.
18733 := Just leave me alone. I'll get by without your help or abuse, thank you very much.
18734 := Hello there. I... wanted to thank you for showing me I should get out of the swoop circuit. I just don't have what it takes.
18735 := You beat my time easy, and you're not even a pro. I'm taking the hint and leaving before I lose all my credits in the sport.
18736 := I really wanted to make a go of it... but I guess you can't always do what you want. Well, you can. Nice racing. Good luck on your career.
18737 := I guess it doesn't. I just couldn't compete with the professionals, or even the serious amateurs. I was never even in the running.
18738 := That won't work now, I think. You and all the other racers have outclassed me in every round. I just don't have the resources to compete.
18739 := Maybe if I had been able to get my swoop upgraded... I don't know. It's too late now. It was fun while it lasted, but it's over. Goodbye.
18740 := I suppose, but I wanted to go past them. Do you know that no Aqualish has ever taken Sector Champion? I had hoped... 
18741 := Ah, it's too late for that. Maybe if I'd got some swoop upgrades... I don't know. It was fun while it lasted, but it's over. Goodbye.
18742 := It's too late for that. Maybe if I could have had one last good run... maybe if I could have upgraded my swoop. Ah, it doesn't matter.
18743 := Thanks anyway, but I'll be leaving now. Back to the processing job, I guess. This was fun while it lasted. Goodbye.
18744 := I don't really understand why you gave me the money to upgrade my swoop and then didn't give me time to do it before beating my time.
18745 := I guess you had your reasons. Here, take your money back. I won't need it now.
18746 := You are very generous, but it's too late for that. I've got no reason to think I could win even with the time to upgrade.
18747 := I had fun for a while, but I just can't compete without upgrades. I'll leave it to you professionals. Goodbye.
18748 := You owe me more. It's called interest.
18749 := Do as I say! Pay me for my trouble!
18750 := Fine. Just answer my questions then.
18751 := Thank you. I knew you would do well.
18752 := You keep it. Use it for more upgrades.
18753 := You sound pathetic.
18754 := Sorry. I want to ask some questions.
18755 := Whose fault is it? Like I said: pathetic.
18756 := Very sad. Just answer my questions.
18757 := I just want to ask a few questions.
18758 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
18759 := Do you know much about Manaan?
18760 := Have the Sith been a problem?
18761 := What do you know about kolto?
18762 := I want to ask about you and racing.
18763 := Let's go back to my first questions.
18764 := What can you tell me about the other racers?
18765 := How long have you been at this?
18766 := Use the money I gave you to upgrade.
18767 := What do you mean by that?
18768 := I have no respect for beggars, fool.
18769 := You mentioned you needed 500 credits.
18770 := Ah, now I understand. You need a loan.
18771 := How much do you think you need?
18772 := I guess you'd better just give up.
18773 := There's no way you can earn the money?
18774 := If I had that much I'd give it to you.
18775 := Here, I can give it to you.
18776 := Is Manaan a good course for racing?
18777 := What is bothering you?
18778 := This sport doesn't need losers.
18779 := Quitter! Stand up for yourself!
18780 := It's good to know your limits.
18781 := Why don't you keep trying?
18782 := Keep the money. Try again.

18798 := This entrance to the Sith Embassy has been closed temporarily due to a maintenance failure. The main entrance to the Embassy will reopen when the problem has been fixed.
18799 := Those with legitimate business with the Sith should return when the repairs have been completed.
18800 := The secondary external entrance is reserved for Sith personnel only and is not to be used by visitors.
18801 := What?! How did you... Um... This unit has no knowledge of what you're talking about.
18802 := I will be going.
18803 := How can I get inside now?
18804 := I heard the Embassy was attacked.
18805 := Why are you disturbing me, off-worlder? I did not indicate I wished to converse with you.
18806 := If you are fool enough to draw your weapon, you will find yourself locked up for a long, long time.
18807 := I have nothing further to say to a thug such as you.
18808 := First you interrupt my thoughts, then you scuttle off. You off-worlders are a curious bunch. It is no wonder I find so few of you worth talking to.
18809 := Consult your own diplomat if you have questions, off-worlder. If you do not know of him, go to the Republic enclave and find him.
18810 := He is paid to be of service to your kind - I am not. I believe this concludes our conversation.
18811 := Why do you disturb me, off-worlder? Are you trying to recruit me to your cause? You should save your lung gas - this Selkath's neutrality is not for sale.
18812 := It is well known that off-worlders have been recruiting the Selkath to join their organizations in an effort to undermine Manann's neutrality.
18813 := Just recently the Sith were given harsh diplomatic penalties for these actions. Now you are trying to recruit me.
18814 := So you say, off-worlder... but I have my doubts. I believe this conversation is completed.
18815 := I have no wish to talk with your kind, off-worlder! I have heard the rumors. We Selkath know your kind are to blame for the poor kolto harvest.
18816 := We have a saying here on Manaan - you can know the what is beneath the water by the ripples on the surface. Do you understand, off-worlder?
18817 := The Manaan authorities may not have the proof to proceed with official diplomatic sanctions against the Republic, but we Selkath know who is to blame.
18818 := I see no further point in continuing this conversation.
18819 := You need an attitude adjustment!
18820 := I'm sorry. I'll be going now.
18821 := I'd like to ask you some questions.
18822 := What are you talking about?
18823 := I think you're paranoid.
18824 := I'm not trying to recruit you.
18825 := I'm the one who exposed the Sith!
18826 := You Selkath blame without any proof!
18827 := Not really.
18828 := I think so.
18829 := Greetings, off-worlder. While I do not have time to converse with you, I hope you find what you are looking for here on Manaan.
18830 := The Sith have tried to manipulate our courts time and again, seeking power for themselves. I hope our government decides to do more against this.
18831 := I find it shocking that a hero of the Republic - Sunry - could do such a thing. Perhaps I have been wrong in my judgment of the Republic.
18832 := Many say that the Republic has had something to do with the economic restriction our people have placed on all trade. I hope it is not true.
18833 := You will stay here in the prison until your fine of 100 credits is paid.
18834 := Then we will confiscate what money you have and you will be deported to your ship. Similar offences will be dealt with in an equally harsh manner.
18835 := You are now free to go, human. Remember to keep the peace, or you will face the penalties once more.
18836 := [Failure] You try to influence my mind! We do not tolerate disrespect for the law here on Manaan.
18837 := Your money will be confiscated and you will be deported to your ship. Similar offences will be dealt with in an equally harsh manner.
18838 := [Success] Perhaps we were wrong about you, human. You may go.
18839 := You will find our prices are fair human. After selling your equipment, speak to me again to pay your fine.
18840 := You have been charged with flagrant violations of the Ahto City laws, and insubordination towards a Selkath constable. The fine is 500 credits.
18841 := You will stay here in the prison until your fine is paid.
18842 := I don't have 100 credits.
18843 := Here are the 100 credits.
18844 := [Force Persuade] You really want to let me go. I have done nothing.
18845 := I need to sell some equipment.
18846 := I don't have 500 credits.
18847 := Here are the 500 credits.
18848 := Obey our laws here on Manaan, off-worlder. A law-abiding visitor is a visitor that does not go to prison.
18849 := You got any armor plating for my swoop bike?
18850 := Yes, I have a fine piece right here. A little dented, but still serviceable. And a real bargain at that price.
18851 := I thought this garbage was free! You actually sell this junk? You fish are a strange breed.
18852 := Get out of my store! I'm sick of you Sith and your stupid jokes! 
18853 := I've got real customers to worry about - I don't need you coming in here and making fun of my inventory every day!
18854 := Don't worry, junkman, when I want garbage I'll be back!
18855 := Only people who have business with the Sith are allowed inside the Embassy.
18856 := Go. Stay. Doesn't matter to me. If you want to, you can even wander up to the embassy gates. Heh. But don't expect to get inside.
18857 := Oh, really? You mean someone like you actually has some real purpose inside? Well, then, what is it?
18858 := Hmph. Yes, well, I suppose you really do have some business here. Head on in.
18859 := If you have a pass, why are you bothering me with it? Just go in.
18860 := Ha! We know who we have business with. If you don't know how to get in, then we don't want anything to do with you. Now back off!
18861 := You can ask - but I doubt you'll get many answers you'll like.
18862 := I haven't the faintest clue as to what you're talking about.
18863 := Who knows? Some scheming plot, no doubt. Hopefully the Selkath uncover it and ban the Republic from the planet.
18864 := I know he'd already be tried, convicted and executed if the Selkath knew anything about justice! But the fish people are as weak as the Republic when it comes to such matters.
18865 := Is there anything else?
18866 := Allow me to thank you for helping put that killer Sunry in prison. Elassa was a friend of mine, and the thought of her murderer going free enraged me!
18867 := But thanks to you, justice was served. So what can I do for you?
18868 := I can't believe you let that murderer Sunry go free! If the Selkath are so neutral and unbiased, why can't the Sith find any justice on this planet?
18869 := But we Sith have long memories. Soon there will be a day of reckoning - very soon. So what are you doing here?
18870 := I know you. You're the Arbiter in the murder trial. Elassa was a friend of mine. If there's any justice in the galaxy, they'll feed Sunry to the firaxans.
18871 := Shouldn't you be preparing for the trial? What are you doing here?
18872 := I'll be going now.
18873 := I know the pass code.
18874 := Zeta 245698 Alpha.
18875 := I have this passcard.
18876 := I have business with the Sith.
18877 := I want to ask you some questions.
18878 := Why have the Sith taken such an interest in the Selkath youth?
18879 := Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?
18880 := Do you know about the Sunry case?
18881 := I have no desire to speak to you. I know you have links to the Republic.
18882 := We might have a position within the Sith organization for one such as you.
18883 := Your offer is pretty good. But I've heard some nasty things about you Sith. Is it true you bombed Taris into dust?
18884 := This is war. In war certain distasteful acts cannot be avoided. But ask yourself this - when we win this war, would you rather be against the Sith, or with us?
18885 := You make a good point. And I've never turned down a job that pays up front.
18886 := Excellent. Report to the Sith Embassy tomorrow for your assignment.
18887 := What do you want now? You press your luck, pestering a Sith soldier. It doesn't seem wise on your part.
18888 := As I have said in the past, the swoop races attract the lowest of rabble. As you are one of them, I suggest you leave me alone.
18889 := Don't count on the small measure of celebrity you have attained at the swoop races. All are equally inferior before the Sith.
18890 := What do we have here? A lost off-worlder, perhaps? You're probably here for the swoop races. Track is through the west corridor. Get moving.
18891 := I hate the rabble the races attract. They're always trouble.
18892 := What did you say? You don't want trouble from me, friend. You might as well take a blaster to your own head.
18893 := I'm sure you didn't. Walk away. Now.
18894 := So, you have some courage. Dumb as a B'omarr castoff, but you've got courage. What do you hope to accomplish with this threat?
18895 := Even if you expected to live through my attack, the Selkath would lock you up for fighting in their streets.
18896 := I thought you might. Walk away. Now.
18897 := Ah, so you wish to goad *me* into action so the Selkath turn their unyielding laws my way? Amusing. Perhaps you aren't so foolish.
18898 := You've made your jest on the one world where you would not be immediately struck down. I suggest you walk away while your assumption holds true.
18899 := I'm no guide. The Sith don't suffer questions for long.
18900 := Of course you do. Good riddance.
18901 := Then seek out a helpful fish for answers. I have no interest in the affairs of the Selkath and you have no reason to inquire about mine.
18902 := What do I think? I think it's a shame when an unworthy newcomer unseats his betters. I am not easily won as a supporter.
18903 := Are you hoping that I will look more favorably on you because you have taken the Sector Champion title? You are mistaken.
18904 := I am fond of the sport, true, but it's more about hating racers I don't think should win than actually paying tribute to those I favor.
18905 := Hurry it up. This is a poor use of my time. You should know not to annoy one of my kind.
18906 := Hukta Jax shows the proper spirit of competition, and it has brought him to the top before.
18907 := The Gamorrean? You're joking.
18908 := Brute force to the finish, he's very efficient.
18909 := I believe Queedle Molta has taken top spot. I prefer the professional racers. His win was just a fluke. An aberration.
18910 := Wait, I recognize you. I watched you take top prize at the swoop tournament. Nice work, Sector Champion, but you haven't won me over.
18911 := Move along, off-worlder. I've had enough of you.
18912 := I don't think I asked your opinion, Sith.
18913 := I meant no harm. I apologize.
18914 := You don't look so tough to me.
18915 := Then I will beg your pardon and leave.
18916 := I made no threat. I merely voiced an opinion.
18917 := Could I ask you a few questions?
18918 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
18919 := I wanted to ask questions about Manaan.
18920 := What do you think of the swoop races?
18921 := Let's go back to my first questions.
18922 := Who do you like?
18923 := Why are you back again? I didn't show enough disinterest the first time around? You really shouldn't pester a soldier of the Sith.
18924 := I shouldn't expect you to listen. You're probably just another open-mouthed fool here for the swoop races.
18925 := Go look for fans over at the swoop races, Sector Champion. I'm sure they'll give you what your looking for.
18926 := What do you want, rail-rat? I don't have the time or desire to bother speaking with wandering idiots.
18927 := Go join the other transients in the swoop race area. At least you'll all be contained.
18928 := Hostile? I would consider this the height of calm for dealing with insects like yourself. If I were hostile, you'd be dead.
18929 := Wisely played. Go away.
18930 := Yes, Manaan is a very unsatisfying world for settling disagreements. The Selkath are very insistant that even words are not used as weapons.
18931 := Since we both refuse to initiate a violent event, you'll have to accept my contempt-filled dismissal, and hope we don't meet again.
18932 := I will get tired of your voice in short order, so make it quick.
18933 := Good. This visit was dragging on.
18934 := Grow some gills and swim the planet yourself. There's no substitute for personal experience. I have nothing else to say on the subject.
18935 := Our Taris campaign killed the giants of the sport. The current racers are hardly inspiring. An Aqualish champion? Hmph. Laughable.
18936 := You're the Sector Champion; you know the races inside and out. Why ask me? Are you trying to worm a compliment out of me?
18937 := Nothing about the current state of the races make me want to watch. Especially if it means associating with the cattle grouped in there now.
18938 := Hurry it up. This is a poor use of my time. You should know not to annoy one of my kind.
18939 := I admire the mercenary spirit of Casandra Mateil. Other than that, no one.
18940 := Her mercenary spirit isn't what's selling the autoprints.
18941 := She does have... other qualities as well.
18942 := You're probably another race fan in a fool's stupor after that big win by local whelp Queedle Molta.
18943 := Go talk with your adoring fans over at the swoop races. I'm sure they fawn all over their beloved Sector Champion.
18944 := Go away. You would regret the only other option.
18945 := I don't like how hostile you are.
18946 := I won't take that chance. Goodbye.
18947 := A pity we can't test the theory now.
18948 := Could I ask you a few questions?
18949 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
18950 := I have some questions about Manaan.
18951 := You mentioned the races.
18952 := Let's go back to my first questions.
18953 := There are no racers you like?
18954 := Move about your business, human.
18955 := Out of my way - unless you want to feel the wrath of the Sith!
18956 := The wrath of the Sith is a terrible thing! Remember Taris! You'll see - you'll all see!
18957 := You dare mock me? If it wasn't for the Selkath laws I'd teach you proper respect!
18958 := Hey, you working for the Republic? You look like a Republic agent - I can see the cowardice in your eyes.
18959 := Are you threatening me? It's illegal to try to start a fight in Ahto City! Constable - over here! This Republic scum is trying to break the peace!
18960 := Is this true human? Are you threatening this woman with violence?
18961 := Human, you are fined 100 credits for disturbing the Manaan peace. If you do not pay, you will be taken to the Manaan prisons.
18962 := Perhaps a 500 credit fine and a stint in the Ahto City jails will teach you to respect our laws. 
18963 := Further disturbances will be dealt with in a similar manner.
18964 := Then you shall be imprisoned until you can pay the fine.
18965 := I am not deaf, human. I heard your words, and threatening physical violence is not permitted in Ahto City.
18966 := Insults are one thing, human. Threats of physical violence are quite another. They are expressly forbidden by the laws of Ahto City.
18967 := [Failure] A strange interpretation of these events, human. One I do not share. Clearly you are the one at fault here.
18968 := [Success] Yes - you are correct, human. The Sith is the one at fault. 
18969 := Me? I didn't do anything! This is an outrage! A travesty of justice!
18970 := Come with me to the Ahto City prisons. We will alert your Embassy and you shall be released when they pay the fine. 
18971 := Though I've known the Sith to let their people languish in the prison for many months before securing their release.
18972 := I'll get you for this, Jedi! The Sith won't stand for this!
18973 := [Failure] Apologies are not sufficient. The law must be upheld.
18974 := [Success] Very well, I shall overlook this infraction. But you would be wise to watch your words in the future, human.
18975 := The Selkath claim neutrality, but you're always giving preferential treatment to the Republic! I'm going to report this incident to the Sith Embassy!
18976 := You think you can impress me by spouting a bunch of Jedi garbage? If it wasn't for the Selkath neutrality laws, I'd add your name to the list of Jedi I've killed.
18977 := Hey - this street is for Sith only. You got to pay a 20 credit toll to walk down this street.
18978 := You talk big - but remember what we did to Taris. Maybe you're next on our list.
18979 := Hiding behind the Selkath laws - typical Republic cowardice!
18980 := Thanks for the credits, nerf-herder!
18981 := Maybe I should just split you open from head to toe! How's that for wrath?
18982 := I've seen the wrath of the Sith. I wasn't impressed.
18983 := Your words are all sound and fury, signifying nothing.
18984 := You better change your attitude, or the Selkath might find your body floating in the ocean!
18985 := ... And? You want a piece of me, too?
18986 := Your laws are nothing to me!
18987 := Here are your credits.
18988 := I don't have that much.
18989 := The Sith and I are exchanging meaningless taunts.
18990 := She started it! She's insulting me.
18991 := [Force Persuade] This argument was the fault of the Sith. She should be arrested.
18992 := [Persuade] I'm sorry, constable. It won't happen again.
18993 := What are you going to do?
18994 := Your taunts are nothing to me. There is no emotion, there is peace.
18995 := You can have your credits when you take them from my cold, dead hand.
18996 := This is a public street!
18997 := Fine, here's your 20 credits.
18998 := Back off, Republic dog! You couldn't hope to compare to a real woman!
18999 := Back off, Republic scum! A man like you couldn't hope to satisfy a Sith woman!
19000 := You are amazing out on the course... and in person. Congratulations.
19001 := I haven't seen a race like that in years. Well, there was Gandroff on Coruscant, but he lacked your... charms.
19002 := You sure put Hukta in his place. I don't have to say that you are a much more appealing champion.
19003 := It's amazing what you've accomplished here, and you've done it with such style. I've never met a woman like you.
19004 := Could I get an autoprint? You've just had the quickest rise to Sector Champion that I've ever seen.
19005 := Wow, I bet you could have won on Taris with times like that. It's a shame we'll never know.
19006 := Good race, Sector Champion. I guess you'll be off to the big tracks, once the circuit is back up.
19007 := Whew, that was an exciting time you turned in. Noboby else had a chance.
19008 := I'm putting all my credits on you. You're a sure thing.
19009 := Are you sure you're up to challenging the third round time? I mean, you're good, but are you that good?
19010 := Some of the other fans didn't think you could reach the second round, but I knew you would all along.
19011 := Some of the racers are having a bad time here on Manaan. Seems like you have all the luck right now.
19012 := You're up against the second round times now. That's a hard round to beat.
19013 := The second round always has experienced riders. You'll be up against some tough times.
19014 := I guess you've got what it takes to advance. The odds against you winning are getting better.
19015 := You're pretty good. Maybe I should start putting some credits on your races.
19016 := Queedle is the local favorite. You should cheer along with us. He needs the encouragement.
19017 := We need more rules about overpowered bikes. Hukta just rides over everything. It's boring watching him.
19018 := Hukta Jax is insane. He just smashes through everything to the finish. I guess we should expect that from a Gamorrean?
19019 := You here to cheer Casandra? She's a fine racer. I hope she knocks Hukta out of the running.
19020 := I cheer for Queedle now that he's winning. It would take an amazing racer to win me away.
19021 := How about that? Queedle, a local racer, showing those pros how it's done!
19022 := A new Champion! And it's Queedle! I knew he could do it with a decent swoop under him.
19023 := I don't believe it! Who'd have thought Queedle had it in him?
19024 := You sure you're cut out for this league of racing? Maybe the stress of it is getting to you.
19025 := You didn't look too good out there on that last run. I guess everyone has their bad days.
19026 := No offence, but I could have done better than you on that last race. As a true fan, I know how to do these things right.
19027 := Well, I guess the course proved too much for you at this level. Better luck next time.
19028 := The crowd really started pulling for you in that last race. Everyone loves a winner, I guess.
19029 := Your win was a complete surprise to everyone. I'm sure the crowd thought you would burn out, but you showed them.
19030 := You're deadly serious out on the course. Like Hukta Jax, but with talent. You deserve to be champion.
19031 := Ha. I've never seen anyone who rides like you. This has been a great tournament.
19032 := Racers like you are why I watch the sport. You dominated the whole field. It was... exhilarating.
19033 := You handled that race like a pro. I like confident men.
19034 := I didn't think you had it in you, but I guess I was wrong. You've really won me over, champion.
19035 := Well, you've captured the sector championship. I have to say I've never seen such an... impressive racer.
19036 := Nice race. How do you go so fast? Are you sure your swoop is legal?
19037 := If you win again, I'll be absolutely amazed. You are moving up so fast.
19038 := You're surprising a lot of people. Me included. Nice job out there.
19039 := Some of the crowd may turn on you. You're not the underdog anymore.
19040 := Not bad at all, but I'll start cheering when you prove you're not just using beginner's luck.
19041 := You won't have such an easy run in the second round. We get some experienced riders through here.
19042 := You're not bad for a beginner. It's almost like you've competed at this level before.
19043 := I sure hope you're staying here. Beating the first round has made you look pretty good to the crowd.
19044 := Have you been to the swoop races before? Some of these riders are sure full of themselves.
19045 := Sure the swoop circuit is suffering a bit with Taris gone, but we still have some good racers to watch.
19046 := You'll have to get in line for the good seats when the races start. There's a lot of people that want to see them.
19047 := I was down here last week and I got Casandra Mateil's autoprint. She doesn't do that very often.
19048 := Everyone thought Queedle couldn't compete because he was just a local racer, but he's shown them all.
19049 := Queedle has really improved out there. He was always my favorite.
19050 := I always cheered Queedle before, and I guess it helped! He's beaten everyone!
19051 := It's amazing what's been happeing on the track! Queedle has taken the top spot!
19052 := You'll have to do better than that if you want to be sector champion.
19053 := Your last race was a disappointment. Lose many more and the crowd will turn on you.
19054 := I was cheering for you. I hope I didn't jinx your race. 
19055 := You're only as good as your last race. Remember that.
19056 := Don't worry about hurrying through the ranks. With the circuit down, there's not many other places to race right now. 
19057 := Racing here is pretty well regulated. I hear that other tracks are falling under Hutt control.
19058 := Good to see a new racer coming in. I want to see someone give the pros a run for their money.
19059 := You'll find that racing here is serious business. Maybe even dangerous sometimes.
19060 := I could have been champ. I can't afford the swoop upgrades though.
19061 := You'll be the talk of Manaan for a while. Nobody is going to get anywhere near your time.
19062 := Are you sure you're not a pro? You sure seem to know what you are doing out there.
19063 := Wow, you shot through the ranks here. I'm impressed. I couldn't do that.
19064 := This isn't the best track, but it's better than the dustbowl on Tatooine.
19065 := You're probably here to see the more established racers. That'll be me someday.
19066 := I'm just starting out. Hopefully when the circuit is back up fans like you will start to know my name when I race.
19067 := Hey! Come to cheer your favorite swoop-jock? Well, this is the place now that Taris is gone...
19068 := Greetings again. Will you be racing today? We're always looking for serious competition for the established riders.
19069 := Greetings to you, off-worlder. Are you here as a spectator, or will you be entering the swoop field as a contender?
19070 := As you will. Please return if you have business related to the races.
19071 := You must be very new to Manaan if you are unfamiliar with the swoop races. Our course is one of the most respected in the sector.
19072 := Of course, with the destruction in Taris, we're in a bit of a rebuilding phase. Our Sector Champion was one of the casualties there.
19073 := Perhaps you have, but that is not a recognized circuit track. Motta the Hutt is not a respected promotor, no matter what he says.
19074 := He has also altered the payment structures set up for the swoop circuit. Of course, most of the governing circuit organization was lost on Taris.
19075 := I hesitate to believe that. Sith interference disrupted any holo-feed that might have verified your story. We only know that all on Taris were lost.
19076 := You are welcome to prove your skill here, regardless of experience. The course is open to any that have the means to participate.
19077 := 100 credits must be paid for each officially timed attempt that you make. This amount will be due before each race.
19078 := Very well. I will tell our organizers to have the course ready for your return.
19079 := Of course, Sector Champion.
19080 := The course is laid out in buoys across the ocean surface of Manaan. You race against times set by others, with no other swoops on the track.
19081 := Your bike likely has the standard five gears to shift through. As your speed increases, watch the indicators in the lower left to know when to shift.
19082 := Shift at the wrong time and your swoop will accelerate poorly or slow down. Shift correctly and you will optimize your perfomance.
19083 := You can also steer over "swoop boosters" placed along the route. These will increase your speed substantially for a short time.
19084 := There are obstacles that you must watch for. Steering over floating buoys won't damage your bike, but it will slow you down.
19085 := Races on the Manaan course are organized in the galactic standard three round system. Each round pays differently.
19086 := Certainly. I'm always accomodating to the racers.
19087 := Sparce. Taris took a great many good racers with it when it was destroyed. Including our Sector Champion, Sakul Ondondanax.
19088 := Currently our biggest attractions are Casandra Mateil and Hukta Dax. They are the only touring professionals present for this tournament.
19089 := But, even with such auspicious competition, Queedle is the racer getting the biggest responses. He's a local favorite, and very talented.
19090 := The biggest surprise of this tournament has been Queedle. He's gone from underdog to champion in short order. The crowd loves him for it.
19091 := The racer getting the biggest crowd response was a local underdog named Queedle, but he has decided to retire. A loss, to be sure.
19092 := Round One pays 500 credits. Round Two pays 2000 credits. Round Three is 5000 credits. These are relatively standard values for the sport.
19093 := Each round is paid out only once per tournament. The leader that shows dominance in all three is named Sector Champion.
19094 := Here on Manaan, Round One is the domain of hobbyists and amateurs. I mean no disrespect by that. They just can't afford the faster swoops yet.
19095 := Round Two is populated by the beginner touring racers. They have decided to invest in the sport, and are attempting to make it pay.
19096 := Round Three is usually only attainable by seasoned professionals. There have been exceptions, but only rarely.
19097 := Tatooine is not recognized, and won't be while Motta insists on refusing to accept galactic standards. When the circuit is reestablished, he will fall in line.
19098 := You have already achieved the pinnacle of the sport, and can't earn any more at this time. You'll be notified when more races are scheduled.
19099 := Winners of the first round are paid 500 credits. It's enough to cover your expenses, but you'll have to keep racing to really make it pay.
19100 := We'll record this for future reference, and wish you well on your attempt to reach Sector Champion.
19101 := A second round win is worth 2000 credits to you. Many racers bow out when they reach this level, but I have a feeling you won't.
19102 := The next round of races will determine Sector Champion. You'll have to be flawless to achieve that.
19103 := You have won a great deal of money. The payment for becoming Sector Champion is 5000 credits!
19104 := That will be the last amount offered for now. When we begin a new round of races we will make certain you are notified.
19105 := I'm afraid your recent performance hasn't been worthy of payment. Improvement will be needed on your part.
19106 := Very well, but before we place your swoop in the starting position, I must collect the 100 credit fee.
19107 := [Success] Perhaps you don't need to pay the fee for this race. Yes, I think that is an acception we can make this one time.
19108 := I'll warn you, though, I will not be able to offer this option again. My accounts are very closely monitored. Now, let's look at who you will be timed against.
19109 := [Failure] I'm sorry, but I can't make that exception in this case.
19110 := [Success] I would tend to agree. We already have a number of racers that are struggling. I will drop the fee to 50 credits.
19111 := I'm sorry, but that it the bets I can do at the moment. My accounts are closely monitored.
19112 := I am sorry, but we cannot make exceptions. We find that racers are more considerate of the course if they have to pay for upkeep.
19113 := Very good, off-worlder. Now we must determine what time you will be trying to beat. Let's have a look at the standings.
19114 := Queedle is a local favorite, but this won't be much of a race. His swoop simply isn't professional quality. Time to beat, <CUSTOM18>.
19115 := Manaan swoop racing fans, we have a race about to commence! Show your respect as the newcomer challenges Queedle for Round One placing!
19116 := Casandra Mateil is your opponant for this round. Her time of <CUSTOM19> remains the respectable mark to beat.
19117 := Racing fans, your attention! A new challenger will now attempt to unseat Casandra Mateil! Let them hear you!
19118 := Hukta Jax is your opponant now. His time of <CUSTOM20> is your mark. I trust you are ready?
19119 := Manaan race fans! A new contender now addresses the time of Hukta Jax! A race to end all races! Beginning now!
19120 := This will be an exciting race, I think. You are going against Queedle's new time of <CUSTOM21>. He's the solid crowd favorite now.
19121 := Attention fans! A new contender will now face the time set by your resident champion Queedle! Excitement is guaranteed!
19122 := I'm afraid there are no rounds currently in need of completion. As Sector Champion, you will be notified if further races are to take place.
19123 := You can feel free to speak with the track Maintenance Officer to book a practice run, but it won't be officially timed.
19124 := There is a small fee for practice runs, but it is significantly less than for official races.
19125 := Er... before you do... your next race would be against the leading time set by racer Hukta Jax. He was very insistent that you speak with him first.
19126 := Please, try not to anger the Gamorrean. He could prove troublesome, and we don't want the scandal of having to jail professional swoop racers.
19127 := He will be in the Racers' Lounge, the room just to the east.
19128 := I must first pay you for your win in the previous round of races. We must keep the accounts up to date.
19129 := Your persistence is admirable after your last race being such a disappointment. First I must ask that you pay the 100 credits racing fee.
19130 := I'm sorry, but I'm sure there are others that will have what you need. My duty is to organize the races, and I pay attention to little else.
19131 := Welcome back, Sector Champion. I'm sorry, but no new races have been scheduled yet. You will be notified when they are.
19132 := Greetings, Sector Champion. You have proven a spectacular racer, despite the near-lawless taunting of Hukta Jax.
19133 := There are no new races sheduled as of yet, but we will be sure to notify you as soon as there are.
19134 := We will, of course, pay you for your win. Your racing skills have earned it.
19135 := I don't need anything. Never mind.
19136 := Tell me about what goes on here.
19137 := I'm not interested in this. Goodbye.
19138 := I would like to sign on as a racer.
19139 := I have raced on Tatooine.
19140 := I won the season opener on Taris.
19141 := I'll be back later.
19142 := Give me the basics on how to race.
19143 := Are there any hazards on the course?
19144 := I'm owed money for my last race.
19145 := I want to talk about the rewards.
19146 := Let's go back to my other questions.
19147 := Describe the current crop of racers.
19148 := What does each round pay?
19149 := Tell me what the rounds are.
19150 := Tatooine uses tiers instead of rounds. Why the difference?
19151 := Go over the system anyway.
19152 := I'm ready to race.
19153 := [Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the fee.
19154 := [Persuade] Lowering the fee would encourage new racers.
19155 := I can't pay that amount either.
19156 := I'll pay the 50 credits.
19157 := I can't pay that much.
19158 := I'll pay the 100 credits.
19159 := Where is he?
19160 := Can you help me with information?
19161 := I don't know how much longer I can stay on this world... The Selkath don't make it easy for us off-worlders.
19162 := A friend of mine recently got into Pazaak - you know, the card game. Now he can't stop! It's so addictive!
19163 := Wow! Hey, you're the sector swoop champ, right? Too bad about the circuit being so small this year, but still!
19164 := The whole swoop racing circuit for this sector has been falling apart since the Sith bombed Taris.
19165 := Did I tell you I'm a fan? I saw recordings of some of your races and you're great! Maybe when they get the circuit back up we can really see what you can do!
19166 := I hear there's going to be a heavy meteor shower in the Coruscant system this year. Last time this sort of thing happened, they lost one of the orbital stations.
19167 := I hear the Czerka Corp. got kicked off Kashyyyk by the locals... Good for them! At least someone's getting something back from them.
19168 := There's a lot of credits to be made in the Republic in times like these. If we survive of course...
19169 := The fighting between the Republic and the Sith is spreading farther. I wonder how long before Manaan becomes a battleground...
19170 := I heard there's been some sort of revolt on one of the Sith worlds. Maybe the Republic would actually have a chance... if it weren't for Malak.
19171 := I heard the Sith are trying to work on a synthetic version of kolto. I wouldn't be surprised if the Republic was, too.
19172 := Manaan may not seem very hospitable, but a surprising amount of trade runs through it because of the kolto trade.
19173 := The Selkath have clamped down on kolto exports all of a sudden. No one knows why. If someone did something to offend them, there's going to be trouble I think.
19174 := Welcome to the used goods store of Yortal Ixlis. If there is anything I can help you with, all you need to do is ask.
19175 := As you wish, human. Should you ever find yourself in need of quality used merchandise I urge you to return to my establishment.
19176 := I fear I will be of little help in providing information, human. I spend most of my time here in my shop or out collecting inventory.
19177 := And at night, I am too exhausted to do anything but return home and sleep in preparation for the next day. 
19178 := I will do my best to answer your questions, but I cannot promise to be of much help.
19179 := Ah. Yes. That. Well, I was not always in such dire straits. In fact, once I would have been quite well off, but the Sith had other plans.
19180 := Well, technically my debt is to the Czerka Corporation, but that amounts to the same thing in the end.
19181 := I need money to pay them off, but I cannot find work anywhere the Czerka Corporation has influence. So they put me here, fixing scraps and selling them for little profit.
19182 := In time, in years I may be able to repay my debt, but for now I must work. Is there anything else I may help you with?
19183 := I was quite a hand at electrical and mechanical devices of all sorts. I traveled the galaxy working for hire among all sorts of beings. But one day I failed in a task for a Czerka Corporation executive and was forced into debt.
19184 := Yes, my debt to them is quite large I fear, and it will be no easy task to repay it.
19185 := I know of no such thing in Ahto City. This is the only city on Manaan suited to non-Selkath. The oceans are the ancestral home of their people. If there are any ancient ruins of their culture, they would lie there.
19186 := I know nothing of this trial, though I find the facts hard to accept. Sunry was a famous hero of the Republic - hardly the type to commit murder.
19187 := I would not be surprised to learn the Sith have framed the poor man in an effort to embarrass the Republic. The Sith have no conscience in such matters.
19188 := I have no proof that they are, yet it would not surprise me. The Sith are evil to the core.
19189 := My own experiences with the Sith have been most unpleasant. They come and mock me, and damage my goods. But I cannot take action against them, or they would surely kill me.
19190 := I cannot say. Perhaps the Republic is preparing for a battle with the Sith. They are at war, after all.
19191 := And I wish the Republic a quick and total victory. My own life will be much easier once the Sith have been defeated and destroyed.
19192 := Of course, human. My stock is all second hand, and some of it has minor damage.
19193 := But with the repairs I have done to them, my items are as good as new - for a fraction of the price.
19194 := Come in human, please. I need all the customers I can get. Since kolto production dropped the Ahto City authorities have increased my business taxes tenfold to make up the shortfall!
19195 := I am loathe to leave this planet, but I fear I cannot long afford to continue business under these circumstances. What is it you need, human?
19196 := The Sith fight amongst themselves constantly, even their masters. I heard that happened on Korriban, but none of the Sith are talking about it.
19197 := The Sith and their Czerka Corp. dogs have been driven off Kashyyyk I was told. Good riddance I say! If only we could do that here...
19198 := Is there anything you need help with?
19199 := Welcome, come in. I have heard you are a swoop racer, and swoop racers always have money to spend. My favorite customers.
19200 := Whatever you desire, you will find it here at Yortal's secondhand shop. So what can I do for you, friend?
19201 := Welcome, human. Please come in. Today is a good day for me. I have heard the Sith will face severe penalties for their plot to corrupt the Selkath youth. 
19202 := I doubt they will be banned from the planet, but any penalty they suffer brings me joy. So, what can I do for you on this joyous day, human?
19203 := Are you here to mock me as the Sith, or do you actually want to buy something?
19204 := I suppose I deserve that. But you'd be bitter too, if the Sith kept coming in and making fun of you and your inventory!
19205 := Let us forget this unpleasantness and start our meeting over, yes?
19206 := Please, forgive me. I had no cause to be so rude to you. The Sith make such trouble for me and business has been slow.
19207 := But that is no excuse for my tone. I apologize. Please, let us start off on the right foot.
19208 := I think I'll be going now.
19209 := I'd like to ask you some questions.
19210 := How did you come to run a junkpile... er... used goods shop?
19211 := What does that have to do with running a junk shop?
19212 := How did you get in debt?
19213 := You owe them money?
19214 := I'm looking for some ancient ruins, or possibly some type of Star Map.
19215 := I'm investigating the Sunry case.
19216 := Are the Sith involved in the recent disappearance of the Selkath youth?
19217 := Do you know why the Republic is hiring mercenaries?
19218 := I have some more questions for you.
19219 := I'd like to look at your inventory.
19220 := Watch your tone, or you'll be looking for some replacement limbs!
19221 := With an attitude like that, it's no wonder you have no customers!
19222 := Maybe I'll come back when you're in a better mood.
19223 := I'm interested in buying something.
19224 := I'm not here to make fun of you. I'm <FullName>.
19225 := Hello there. Are you looking to book the swoop course for a practice run? There will be a small positioning fee of 20 credits to have your swoop bike readied.
19226 := Very well. Goodbye.
19227 := We find that racers are more careful when they are funding the course with each race. Besides, we must defray maintenance costs somehow.
19228 := And please, no haggling. I am not authorized to give a discount even if I wished to.
19229 := Certainly. Your swoop will be towed into position immediately. It shouldn't take long to begin the run.
19230 := Please speak to the Course Regulator for information on challenging the current leaders in each race category.
19231 := Welcome, Sector Champion. Would you like to book the swoop course for a practice run? For a small fee of 20 credits you can keep your skills in top shape.
19232 := No thanks. Goodbye.
19233 := Why is there a fee?
19234 := I'll pay for a practice run.
19235 := I want an officially timed race.

19400 := You with the Selkath? You here to see me about the murder too?
19401 := I told the damn fish everything I knew, what more do you all want from me?
19402 := Yes, well I'll be right here... Not like they're letting me go anywhere else...
19403 := I was in my room, minding my own business with the lastest copy of Pazaak Weekly - checking out the listings for the big tournament that's gonna be held here soon - when I heard a blaster shot.
19404 := Being still alive - and therefore smart enough not to stick my head out immediately - I didn't go out right away. I looked out after a minute and saw Gluupor in the hall by Elassa's room, and Sunry running like the wind.
19405 := You can't tell me that someone who was running like that - and he was pretty fast for a cripple! - isn't guilty.
19406 := Sunry I only heard of once or twice in passing. Some sort of old-time war hero against the Sith. Seen him around in the hotel too. Going to Elassa's room always of course.
19407 := Kept the rest of the building up half the night with their damn antics usually! 
19408 := Yes. She rented a room every week or so. Coincidentally it was right about the same time that Sunry would show up. They didn't seem all that discreet either.
19409 := I'm not saying anything like that. What they did in that room, in private, is their business.
19410 := And there isn't any rule against Sith and Republics seeing each other for personal reasons. Although if you think her Sith Master didn't know, heh, you must be fooling yourself.
19411 := Uh... well Elassa was a Sith... so of course she'd have to have someone above her... yeah. I didn't see anything!
19412 := Thanks...
19413 := [Success] You know, I think I could trust you. Heck, I don't know why I shouldn't tell you.
19414 := [Failure] 100 credits isn't enough for the kind of trouble I'd be having if I told you. Sorry, you're gonna have to look somewhere else.
19415 := [Success] Since you put it that way...
19416 := [Failure] I didn't see anything and there's no way you can make me say otherwise! Now quit asking!
19417 := [Success] Well... one time... I saw Elassa coming in wearing this big cloak. I was on my way to my room, and she normally wears stuff like that so I didn't pay her too much attention.
19418 := But this time I accidentally brushed up against her - accidentally of course! - and her cloak fell open...
19419 := Now I don't have no qualms about the Sith! I leave them alone and they leave me alone. And seeing as how Elassa had a Sith lightsaber under her cloak, I'm not going to poke that hornet's nest.
19420 := I know, I know, but you're a Jedi. Elassa never claimed to be.
19421 := I don't know what it means to you, but to me it kind of screams 'Dark Jedi'. And I'm not getting myself in any further with the Sith. I know how ruthless they are.
19422 := Now that's all I'm going to tell you. I'll testify it to the court, but you aren't going to get anything else out of me.
19423 := Seems so... But I'm not getting myself in any further with the Sith. I know how ruthless they are.
19424 := Nothing more for now.
19425 := Nothing for now.
19426 := What did you see the night of the murder?
19427 := I have nothing more to ask for now.
19428 := What do you know about Sunry and Elassa?
19429 := Elassa roomed here often?
19430 := You mean Sunry was having a relationship with Elassa?
19431 := Sith Master?
19432 := Okay, okay, I'll ask something else.
19433 := [Force Persuade] You know you want to tell me.
19434 := [Persuade] Maybe if I tossed in 100 credits?
19435 := [Persuade] What did you see?
19436 := I have a lightsaber too, you know.
19437 := A lightsaber does not mean anything.
19438 := She was a Dark Jedi?
19439 := Why you back, human? Gluupor already tell you everything. Why you not leave Gluupor alone?
19440 := You here with Selkath? You have questions for Gluupor? Gluupor already say everything he knows.
19441 := Gluupor answer later too, then. Selkath not let Gluupor leave while trial still on...
19442 := Gluupor heard of it, yes. But Gluupor been locked in this room for days. Gluupor think it rather poor insight to think he knows something.
19443 := Gluupor not know what you talking about. But then again, Gluupor not very bright.
19444 := Gluupor tell everything to Selkath. You not know? Gluupor have no reason not to say. Gluupor tell everything. Everything about murder, everything about Sith lady's room.
19445 := Gluupor just curious... just curious to see what had happened. Gluupor have no reason to go into room... no one pay Gluupor to do it.
19446 := [Success] Gluupor want to tell you. Gluupor want to tell you Sith paid him money to plant medal on body.
19447 := Gluupor want to tell you this because you are Gluupor's friend. Good friend... maybe give Gluupor money? Maybe not...
19448 := [Failure] Gluupor not saying anything... Gluupor have nothing to say.
19449 := [Failure] No one pay Gluupor to do anything... that why Gluupor so poor...
19450 := [Success] How you know someone pay Gluupor?!
19451 := Well... Sith man came up to Gluupor after murder, before Selkath arrive. He say he give Gluupor good money if Gluupor put medal into Sith's hand.
19452 := Gluupor good. Gluupor plant evidence and leave no trace. But Gluupor not recognize Sith man anyway. Gluupor not recognize humans very well.
19453 := No use to Selkath, so not bother to tell them. Well, that, and the Sith man say he kill Gluupor if Gluupor speaks. Uh... Oh, no...
19454 := Gluupor think... Gluupor think he can't talk more right now. Gluupor feels the need to lie down... maybe just stay here...
19455 := Gluupor not see murder, oh no. Gluupor did see Republic guy... the cripple... Sunry his name, Gluupor thinks. Gluupor see Sunry running away from scene of crime.
19456 := Gluupor see nothing else. Nothing else at all. Especially not in Sith lady's room!
19457 := Gluupor staying at hotel. Gluupor not very rich - hotel much too rich for Gluupor to live at - but Gluupor save for weeks and have enough to stay here for a few days.
19458 := Using Gluupor's chance to live better for a while.
19459 := Gluupor already tell you everything, why you bother Gluupor more... Gluupor not answering any more question for you!
19460 := I'll ask more questions later.
19461 := Do you know about the Selkath youths who have gone missing?
19462 := Do you know about a Star Map?
19463 := I have questions about the murder of Elassa.
19464 := What about Elassa's room?
19465 := [Force Persuade] You want to tell me who paid you and for what.
19466 := [Persuade] How about if I give you 100 credits to tell me?
19467 := [Persuade] Did someone pay you to do something in that room Gluupor?
19468 := What did you see?
19469 := Why were you at the hotel?
19470 := Sorry, but the hotel is closed.
19471 := Ever since the murder, the Selkath have made me keep this place locked up tight. Only the Selkath authorities and those authorized by them are allowed in.
19472 := Yeah. Maybe you can find someplace else to stay.
19473 := A what? No, never head of it. Now this area is closed on account of the murder, so you're gonna have to leave.
19474 := Me? Oh, right. I'm Ignus. This is my hotel.
19475 := But since the murder happened I haven't exactly been able to do a lot of business. That's the price of law and order here, I guess.
19476 := [Failure] Ha! They sent me a list of people to let in, and they're all Selkath. Somehow, you just don't look like one.
19477 := [Failure] I... I... Sorry mate, but it's Selkath authorities only since the murder. You're gonna have to go someplace else to stay.
19478 := This old Republic war-hero by the name of Sunry was seeing this Sith woman here - Elassa.
19479 := Well, they were seeing each other, but the other night a blaster went off in one of the rooms. Sunry got seen leaving the place and the Sith woman was dead on the floor.
19480 := But not everyone thinks this Sunry did it, so the Selkath are holding him in prison while the case gets sorted out. In the meantime they close down my hotel!
19481 := But enough about my problems... You can't stay here while the investigation is on. You'll have to find someplace else to stay. Sorry.
19482 := You're the one defending Sunry now, eh? Well, the hotel's open for you and I guess I got to answer any questions you want, too.
19483 := Well, OK. If you need anything else I'm going to be right here.
19484 := There were only two other people in the hotel when it happened. One was a Rodian named Gluupor. Seems like a really dirty, shifty type.
19485 := Normally I don't let his kind in here - I'm a reputable business man, you know! - but there weren't many people here, so I decided to take a chance.
19486 := The other is a regular named Firith Me. He's a Pazaak player. Probably an addict, but he claims he's big in some circles.
19487 := Don't know anything about him other than that.
19488 := Anything else you want to know?
19489 := Elassa used to rent rooms here every week or so. Then Sunry would come by a couple hours later and stay all night.
19490 := It doesn't take a genius to figure out what was going on.
19491 := The Sith woman Elassa rented a room in the hotel. An hour or two later Sunry comes in and goes to her room. A couple hours later I hear a blaster shot and see Sunry running.
19492 := He can't run good 'cause he's a cripple, but still he was going pretty fast. I would swear he started after the shot though.
19493 := What do you want to know?
19494 := No, I don't think so. I mean, it's possible, just barely, but I wouldn't say that to the court.
19495 := [Failure] What?? Why the hell should I? I'll tell them what I saw and that's it.
19496 := Now is there anything else you want?
19497 := [Success] Yeah. I'll tell the court Sunry left before the shot went off.
19498 := Is there anything else you need?
19499 := [Success] That's a lot of money... Maybe I could do something for you then.
19500 := Alright, I'll do it. I'll tell the Selkath that he left before the shot went off, but this is our little secret. If you try and turn me in for lying, I'm making sure you come with me!
19501 := Now, was there anything else you wanted?
19502 := [Failure] No. No way I'm lying to the court just because you want to get your Republic buddy off, or whatever. I have no interest in going to prison!
19503 := Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure he left after the shot went off.
19504 := Sure. *wink* *wink* Sunry left before the blaster went off, so he couldn't have done it.
19505 := Do you need to know anything else?
19506 := I guess Sunry didn't kill the Sith woman after all. Could have sworn he left after the shot though...
19507 := There, you got what you wanted: Sunry's free. Now don't ever mention my part in this again!
19508 := Shame about Sunry getting convicted like that. I guess he really did kill Elassa after all.
19509 := I'll be going now.
19510 := Have you seen a Star Map?
19511 := Who are you?
19512 := [Lie] I am authorized by the Selkath government.
19513 := [Force Persuade] You want to let me in.
19514 := What murder?
19515 := I have no more questions for now.
19516 := Who are the witnesses in the hotel?
19517 := What do you know about Sunry and Elassa?
19518 := Tell me what you saw the night of the murder.
19519 := I want to ask something else.
19520 := Could it have gone off after he left?
19521 := [Force Persuade] You will testify Sunry left before the shot.
19522 := [Persuade] I could pay you 200 credits to say it.
19523 := [Persuade] You could testify it happened after he left.
19524 := Are you sure?
19525 := *hushed* You, Jedi! I hear you are investigating the Sunry murder trial, are you not? Hmm. This case is not at all that it appears to be. Many currents, might I say, flow beneath the surface.
19526 := Oh, but I think that you do!
19527 := Let us just say that I am an interested party, and that I have, heh heh... concerns.
19528 := This murder is much more complicated than it may first appear. Sunry and Elassa are proxies for their governments and both sides want the other to fail.
19529 := You can see the journey, heh, by the footprints. You understand, yes?
19530 := Hmm, dear dear. I'm saying they both had something to do with it! They've both kept their hands in this from the start!
19531 := If you want to get to the bottom of this murder, you might seek information from both the Sith and the Republic, likely in their Embassies.
19532 := And I've been seen speaking to you for far too long.
19533 := Heed my advice, Jedi, and you may yet find the truths in this murder.
19534 := Because you have no one else to trust? Not Sunry, not the witnesses, and certainly not the judges!
19535 := And if you take my advice, what have you to lose?
19536 := No, of course not! You think state secrets are for sale on the common market?
19537 := You would have to be, heh, devious to get what you want.
19538 := I don't have time for this!
19539 := Why are you telling me this?
19540 := What do you mean?
19541 := You're talking crazy talk.
19542 := Huh?
19543 := Um... I think so... kinda...
19544 := I've heard enough of you!
19545 := Why should I believe you?
19546 := They'd just give it to me?
19547 := Greetings, Master Jedi. I hope you have a pleasant stay here on Manaan. If you have any questions or needs, please direct them to our envoy Roland Wann at our Embassy.
19548 := I can't believe those Selkath found Sunry guilty. The Sith must have bribed them or something... So much for neutrality!
19549 := Good thing Sunry got free! The Sith who tried to pin the murder on him would probably have made him disappear in prison.
19550 := The Sith Embassy has gone silent... and they aren't explaining. I hope it was something bad!
19551 := Kolto production seems to have dropped off a LOT, recently. The Selkath have been eyeing us funny, too...
19552 := Have you managed to retrieve the data from our droid in the Sith base?
19553 := Time is a critical factor. We cannot allow the Sith to decode that data recording or our operations on Manaan would be compromised.
19554 := Excellent! It does not appear to have been tampered with, so the Sith did not manage to copy its contents yet.
19555 := And now for your information... We are not supposed to speak of this, but since you are a Jedi, and we have exhausted all the other options, I think I can entrust you with this.
19556 := As you know, the Republic is fighting for its very existence against the evil of the Sith Empire. As you also undoubtedly know, we are doing very poorly.
19557 := We need much in the way of supplies and material to stem the tide of battle and bring us victory.
19558 := Manaan is the sole source of kolto, the most powerful medical substance in the galaxy. Frankly, we need as much of it as we can get.
19559 := The Selkath conservatives with their neutrality treaties seek to treat the Sith and the Republic equally. This includes kolto exports.
19560 := But a few more far-sighted Selkath see that if the Sith are ever allowed to win, the galaxy will be plunged into darkness and there would be nothing to stop them from taking Manaan anyway.
19561 := So we made a deal...
19562 := I know... but to the senators, it seemed to outweigh the risks.
19563 := Shhh! Not so loud! Yes, it is a technical violation of the treaty, but it is sanctioned by elements of the Selkath government. We need only keep it hidden from the Sith.
19564 := We recently began construction of a secret underground facility to harvest kolto directly at its source. We also hope to one day be able to synthesize it effectively.
19565 := Current techniques are insufficient for the task, so we must mine it for now. The amount we take would hardly be noticed, since most is lost naturally before it reaches the surface anyway.
19566 := We were nearing completion of the base when the digging teams reported some sort of obstruction... an ancient building or artifact. Possibly your 'Star Map'.
19567 := Transmissions from the base were cut off abruptly after that, and we haven't heard from the station since.
19568 := Please, just let me explain.
19569 := *Sigh* We don't know. We just don't know.
19570 := As you may have noticed, we are hiring a lot of mercenaries around here. Ostensibly they're to be shipped off-world to aid in our fight against the Sith, but they are really for another purpose.
19571 := When we lost contact with the station in the Hrakert Rift, we sent our contingent of Republic soldiers down to investigate. None returned...
19572 := We have tried hiring mercenaries and sending them down as well, but none of those expeditions have returned either.
19573 := The reason we really sent that droid underwater - and the reason we needed its data back so badly - was to find out what had happened to the Hrakert Rift station.
19574 := But now that we have the data back, our operation is in no danger of exposure to the Sith. And now I must live up to my end of the bargain.
19575 := I took the liberty of having a submarine prepared for your departure. Merely use this card to get past the door behind our kolto packing room and enter the sub therein.
19576 := It has been programmed to take you down to the station, and also to take you back up should you need something.
19577 := I would send soldiers to assist you, but we have lost many of ours, and nearly exhausted the mercenary population of this planet. The soldiers we have are barely enough to keep this base secure!
19578 := The Sith have also noted our interest and begun to bribe mercenaries away from us...
19579 := Please, find out what happened to the facility. There may be some survivors left down there, perhaps even the head scientist - Kono Nolan.
19580 := Good luck in your efforts.
19581 := Ah, you're back. Have you decided to assist us and, at the same time, yourself?
19582 := There is no need to be so rude.
19583 := Very well.
19584 := Good. I'm glad that you have come to accept the inevitable. Now we can really get down to work.
19585 := There are several leads we have been working on to get into the Sith base. Any of them should work for you, although it might be wise to concentrate your efforts on just one.
19586 := The first method that's possible is to help us interrogate a Sith prisoner we managed to catch after he tried to infiltrate our base. He is being held just inside our enclave.
19587 := We think he may be able to give us the passcode that the Sith give their informers to enter the base.
19588 := He has proved most resilient so far...
19589 := We managed to pick up a crate of blank Sith data cards the type they use for passcards.
19590 := The encryption system to unlock them is very difficult however, but if you are more skilled than our technicians, you may be able to gain access that way.
19591 := The Sith have got the Selkath to give them exclusive use of one of the main hangar bays.
19592 := Visiting Sith masters use this bay to land, then take a speeder over the water to an external entrance to the Sith enclave.
19593 := The luckless spy we mentioned earlier had a passcard to that hangar on him. While it is surely well guarded, it may prove to be the most direct route. Here is the card.
19594 := The Sith base itself is very heavily guarded. If they became aware of your presence, I fear you would be quickly outnumbered and killed.
19595 := Here is a passcard to get you inside our facility. You should find all you need to get started in there.
19596 := You can choose whichever of the methods you want as long as you get in the base and get the data recording back. Which method do you think you would like to try first?
19597 := You'll need luck for that one - odds are they have some pretty strong guards in there. But it's also the way most likely to succeed.
19598 := Good choice. We've been working at that for a while, but it's been too difficult so far. Maybe you'll have better luck.
19599 := Good call, just make sure you don't push him too hard or we might lose him.
19600 := I wish you luck in your task. Should you retrieve the data recording from the droid, return it here to me and we can see about getting you that information.
19601 := Good. It is a very intelligent and skilled individual who can crack the matrices of a Sith encryption system.
19602 := But there is one last method you should know about in case all other options fail.
19603 := Good. It's a logical place to start. But you should also hear about the other options available to you.
19604 := When you are ready to explore the Hrakert Rift, enter the Republic base. In the kolto packing room there is a door leading to the Republic submarines.
19605 := The sub will have a course to the Hrakert Scientific Research facility charted in. It will take you to the Hrakert Rift.
19606 := I wish you luck on your quest. Hopefully a Jedi can succeed where so many others have failed.
19607 := Greetings once again. I trust you have been discrete concerning the events at the Hrakert Rift. 
19608 := Should the Selkath obtain proof of what occured down there the consequences for the Republic would be severe. For both our sakes, I hope you are smart enough to keep silent on this matter.
19609 := Truth be told, I am uncomfortable even with us being seen together. The rumors are already plentiful enough among the Selkath about the Republic's role in this.
19610 := Don't be foolish! If the Republic's role in this is discovered, I will be sure the blame rests on your shoulders as well. We share a secret - and we will share the consequences if the secret is revealed. 
19611 := For both our sakes you should move on. Our conversation attracts undue attention.
19612 := Welcome to Manaan. I am Roland Wann. As the official representative of the Republic Embassy on this planet, I am here to help all citizens of the Republic should they require aid. 
19613 := Then I shall wish you good day. On behalf of the Republic, I hope you enjoy your time here on Manaan.
19614 := You mean you sliced into our... That is a very serious crime! We could have you executed for treason if that information caused any harm!
19615 := But... I may just be willing to overlook this transgression if you NEVER EVER TELL ANOTHER LIVING BEING ABOUT IT.
19616 := And that is all I will ever tell you on the matter.
19617 := I don't know much about the facts of the case, but I find it hard to believe. I never met Sunry, but he's a hero of the Republic - not a murderer.
19618 := The so called evidence against him is an obvious frame up - it has to be! The Sith must have plotted Sunry's downfall to embarass and discredit the Republic!
19619 := The Republic? That makes no sense. Sunry has no enemies in the Republic, and his conviction will make all of our jobs more difficult.
19620 := Who else? Sunry's conviction will be a blow to Republic-Selkath relations. Who would benefit from this other than the Sith?
19621 := If you want to solve this mess, I would focus on the Sith. That, or check out the murder scene at the hotel. Talk to the other guests - maybe they know something.
19622 := I regret I could not be of more assistance in your investigation. Is there anything else?
19623 := Uh... of course, of course. I will do whatever I can. But I am only a simple diplomatic representative of the Republic. I doubt I can be of any use to the Jedi Council.
19624 := An ancient and forgotten race... and you think it may be here on Manaan? Hm...
19625 := Well... perhaps. But if you want to get information about that, you'll have to do something for me first.
19626 := [Failure] Don't think you can manipulate me, Jedi! The Republic Diplomatic Corps has to deal with the Sith all the time, so we are very resistant to mental influence.
19627 := Your only real choice is to help me, so I can help you.
19628 := [Failure] No, no. You do what I want and maybe I can help you out. Until then: nothing.
19629 := We were using a submersible reconnaissance droid in the ocean surrounding Ahto City and it was... damaged. It took a data recording of the outside of the city before being driven off by the firaxan sharks.
19630 := But while it was returning to the surface it encountered difficulties and was disabled. Its automatic systems floated it to the surface, but we could not retrieve it in time.
19631 := The Sith were applying subtle pressure to the Selkath authorities for some reason we have not determined, and were able to delay us long enough that they could retrieve the droid before we did.
19632 := The droid's data centers are heavily encrypted, so it will take the Sith several days, we believe, to get to its data. It was captured 12 hours ago. It is imperative that we get it back!
19633 := It's intelligence information about Sith activities on Manaan, as well as some oceanographic reports on the local marine life.
19634 := But you need our information, and I guarantee you that you will never be able to get it unless we have our secrecy guaranteed against the Sith.
19635 := It is heavily guarded, we are sure, in the Sith Embassy here on Manaan. Since we have no remaining soldiers to spare, and certainly not our elite ones, we have no one capable of entering the Sith base and retrieving it.
19636 := That is what we would ask you to do.
19637 := If you want to find information about ancient ruins or your 'Star Map' or whatever it is, I think this is your best choice.
19638 := But you will have time to consider your options. And when you come to the only conclusion possible, I will be here to tell you how we can work together.
19639 := A beautiful place, Ahto city - a paradise on the water. But remember, within the city itself the Selkath have absolute authority. They are a tough race, but fair. 
19640 := Obey the Selkath laws, keep the peace and you should encounter no problems. I assume you received a visitor guide to the city when you docked your ship.
19641 := I regret there is little I can tell you that is not in the visitor guide, my good Jedi. My duties rarely permit me to venture beyond the walls of the Republic Embassy. 
19642 := Kolto is a precious resource - it's healing powers are near miraculous. During times of war, kolto becomes even more valuable.
19643 := As long as we have the permits, we will continue to harvest kolto and ship it to our Republic soldiers battling against the Sith. Of course, the Sith enjoy the very same privileges.
19644 := If there was some way we could gain an edge over the Sith in our kolto supply...
19645 := But the Selkath are fiercely protective of their neutrality in this conflict. They do not want to grant either side an advantage.
19646 := No I have not.
19647 := Yes, here it is.
19648 := Yeah, yeah, get to the point.
19649 := What has the Republic done?
19650 := This is dangerous...
19651 := You violated the treaty?!?
19652 := What sort of deal?
19653 := What does this have to do with me?
19654 := What happened down there?
19655 := Why have you not investigated?
19656 := What will you do for me?
19657 := How will I get down there?
19658 := Quit bothering me, imbecile.
19659 := Not right now.
19660 := I'll get your recording for you.
19661 := Is there another way?
19662 := Is there another way?
19663 := I think I'll raid the landing bay.
19664 := I think I'll decrypt the passcard.
19665 := I think I'll interrogate the prisoner.
19666 := Decrypting the passcard sounds good.
19667 := Interrogating the prisoner sounds good.
19668 := Maybe a bribe would ensure my silence.
19669 := I think I'll be going now.
19670 := I found this recording in your computers.
19671 := I'm investigating the Sunry case.
19672 := Any chance the Republic is involved?
19673 := Are you so sure it was the Sith?
19674 := That's one possibility.
19675 := I am on a mission from the Jedi Council, perhaps you can help me with it.
19676 := I seek a Star Map, the remnant of an ancient and forgotten race.
19677 := You know something?
19678 := [Force Persuade] You want to tell me.
19679 := [Persuade] Come on, tell me.
19680 := What do you want me to do?
19681 := What is this recording?
19682 := I'm not your errand runner!
19683 := What do you want me to do?
19684 := Where is the droid?
19685 := I do not want to get involved.
19686 := Can I get back to you on this?
19687 := How do I get in the Sith base?
19688 := I have some questions about Ahto city.
19689 := Why are your soldiers loading so much kolto?
19690 := You have returned! I was beginning to fear that you, too, might have been lost. Did you find out what had happened down there at the facility?
19691 := Please, continue your investigations and find out what happened to our facility.
19692 := Something was down there? Living in the Rift by the kolto?
19693 := That's... horrible. The entire operation wasted by a disaster we could never in a thousand years have foreseen.
19694 := What has happened to the facility itself? Were there any survivors?
19695 := Contaminated? That's... That's much worse than I would ever have thought possible. It might have been better to lose the entire facility rather than damage the kolto supply.
19696 := This must remain entirely secret. We cannot allow anyone to find out that we damaged the kolto production or we would be banned permanently from the planet.
19697 := We can only hope that the damage that was caused will go away in time.
19698 := No! That is terrible. That will set our work back years... *sigh* It may even cost us the war.
19699 := While I am glad that you were able to solve our problems, the cost may have ended up being much too high.
19700 := But you have done your job and helped us in our time of need, and for that I thank you.
19701 := Oh, and did you end up finding your Star Map?
19702 := I'll assume that means yes. As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together in the future.
19703 := As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together again in the future.
19704 := Well, that is good to know. Good to know indeed. But... What has happened to the facility? Was it damaged?
19705 := Insane? What did they do? And why?
19706 := They killed... everyone? And the mercenaries we sent later? That is... horrible. What caused them to all go insane at once like that?
19707 := I haven't finished my investigation.
19708 := Your construction woke something up.
19709 := A gigantic firaxan shark that drove all the Selkath insane.
19710 := The kolto seems to have been contaminated.
19711 := The harvesting machine was destroyed.
19712 := None of your business!
19713 := Yes I did.
19714 := A few scientists have survived.
19715 := The Selkath went insane.
19716 := They killed almost everyone on the Station.
19717 := You're back. Do you want to interrogate the prisoner?
19718 := Oh, OK. If you need to find out anything else from this prisoner, though, he'll be here for quite a while, I'm thinking.
19719 := No problem. He's not going anywhere for a LONG time.
19720 := Let's get it started then.
19721 := Uhhh.... *groan*
19722 := Giving up so soon? I think he could last a bit longer. Come back if you want to try to break him again. He's not going anywhere for a LONG time.
19723 := Wh... What do you want?
19724 := T... Tela? How did you find out about her?
19725 := [Failure] Ha! You couldn't have her! You're bluffing, Jedi scum!
19726 := [Success] No! Please don't hurt her! Please...
19727 := [Failure] Do whatever you want! I know you will fail! My fellow Sith are probably even now trying to free me!
19728 := [Success] No! Please don't hurt her! Please...
19729 := [Failure] You think bribes will work? You must be dumber than I thought to think that a Sith would join the losing side just for credits!
19730 := [Success] Yes...it could be... so much easier...
19731 := What... what companion?
19732 := Of course they would never believe we let you go so easily. But they would all too happily believe you betrayed them.
19733 := [Failure] The Sith are not that easy to fool! We would see through your petty deceptions and destroy you for the way you try to humiliate us!
19734 := [Success] You can't do this to me! They would kill me in ways too horrible for you to imagine!
19735 := [Success] Alright! Alright! I'll tell you what you want to know.
19736 := What's the passcode to the Sith base?
19737 := It... It's... zeta 245698 alpha... just... no more.
19738 := Good. With this pass, you should be able to get into the Sith base without trouble.
19739 := Just don't delay too long, or they might learn that he's been captured.
19740 := [Failure] Nothing you could do to us would make us talk! We Sith are stronger than you give us credit for!
19741 := [Success] But he... I... Please don't hurt us.
19742 := The gutless Sith worm is already starting to crack. We'll have what we need within hours.
19743 := [Failure] Ha! The Sith are stronger than you; each one of us! You'll never break us!
19744 := [Success] He wouldn't talk... or has he already? No...
19745 := You're not? You... Lies! You work for the Republic!
19746 := [Faiure] There's nothing you can do to me, Jedi, that the Sith wouldn't do worse! I'm not afraid of you!
19747 := [Success] Please... Please don't hurt me...
19748 := [Failure] You think me weak enough to give in to false promises of wealth and riches? The Sith are stronger than that! We will have it all eventually anyway!
19749 := [Success] Ha! Worth my while... The Sith don't pay very well, but they'd kill me...
19750 := The Sith will never trust you again, spy! We're the only place you have left! Tell us what we want to know!
19751 := [Failure] Never! I am Sith, I will never betray them! Your Republic is weak and will soon fall at any rate!
19752 := [Success] But they... they wouldn't.... would they?
19753 := [Failure] Urgg... No! Never!... 
19754 := Damn, he blanked out!
19755 := You should be careful not to give him too high a dose. He should be more pliable now.
19756 := He's already too full of this stuff as it is. You should question him now, because he's as pliable as he's going to get!
19757 := While the training the Sith gave him will protect him from most normal interrogation techniques, and also from Force persuasion, we have found a few hooks you might find useful.
19758 := He was with another man when he was first spotted. We think it was another spy, but we didn't manage to catch him.
19759 := We also seized some personal documents he had on him when he was captured. It would seem that he's married to a woman named Tela.
19760 := We checked this in our computers and it seems to hold up. We've sent a couple agents to investigate, but it may be a while.
19761 := Ok, but you should know what we have to work with here first.
19762 := What we have here is your standard issue truth serum. It should make him spill his guts in no time. BUT, there is a catch...
19763 := Because of his conditioning, he's able to resist it at small doses. But if you give him too much, his body realizes what you're trying to do and shuts his mind down completely.
19764 := If you do that, you'll have to inject him with an antidote that neutralizes the truth serum. Unfortunately, that, too, has a drawback.
19765 := It causes short term memory loss. This may work to your advantage, because you can try the same tactic over and over again. But if you use it too much, he may forget everything we want to know.
19766 := Shall we get started then?
19767 := Hey you! Wake up! Someone wants to talk to you.
19768 := Good job in getting the pass code out of him. I was sure he couldn't be broken.
19769 := So you're the one Roland has got to help us interrogate this prisoner. I hope your Jedi powers will come in useful, this one has been most resistant.
19770 := He's a Sith spy we picked up a little while ago snooping around outside trying to get in. We thought he was suspicious and brought him inside when the Selkath weren't looking.
19771 := But it seems the Sith have done a pretty good job of conditioning this guy, and we haven't been able to break him yet.
19772 := Well if it's so important, just go then. Not like losing that droid would do anything harmful... like getting us banned from Manaan!
19773 := We're not sure exactly... If you can convince him to talk, we should be able to find that all out.
19774 := The Sith protect their really important spies with some sort of mental Force feedback system. They can turn their minds in on themselves so Force compulsions won't affect them.
19775 := Combine this with conventional training to resist interrogation and it sometimes takes months to get them to tell what they know.
19776 := Do you want to interrogate him now?
19777 := I have a passcard to the Sith base.
19778 := Not right now.
19779 := Yes.
19780 := Stop talking to him.
19781 := Inject him with the neutralizing agent and start over with a new dose of truth serum.
19782 := Interrogate him.
19783 := Let's try something else.
19784 := Maybe we should do something about Tela.
19785 := [Persuade/Lie] We have her already. She may be spared if you talk.
19786 := [Persuade] Talk or something may happen to her.
19787 := [Persuade] We could make life easy for both of you here in the Republic.
19788 := We know about your companion.
19789 := [Persuade/Lie] Perhaps we would give you back to the Sith, but keep him.
19790 := [Persuade/Lie] If you don't tell us, he will suffer.
19791 := [Persuade/Lie] We don't really need you. Your companion will tell us what we need to know anyway.
19792 := Relax. I'm not here to threaten you.
19793 := Let's try something else.
19794 := [Persuade] I don't want to hurt you unless you make me.
19795 := [Persuade] If you talk, we can make it worth your while.
19796 := [Persuade] We're the only ones who will take you in now.
19797 := Inject him with truth serum.
19798 := Let's get started.
19799 := What do I have to work with?
19800 := A catch?
19801 := I detect a pattern here...
19802 := Yes.
19803 := I don't have time for this now.
19804 := What was he doing out there?
19805 := I will interrogate him now.
19806 := What did they do to him?
19807 := What did they do to him?
19808 := People are saying the Republic did something to cripple the kolto production here on Manaan, but I don't believe it. Sounds more like something the Sith would do.
19809 := If you got a problem go talk to our diplomatic representative. Don't bother me with it.
19810 := I can't talk now. I have to get this kolto loaded up before my shift is over.
19811 := The Selkath have scaled back all kolto harvesting - but nobody is saying why. Good thing we've been stockpiling this stuff for the past year.
19812 := Hey - I'm working here! Go talk to the diplomatic rep if you got something to say.
19813 := I can't stop to talk to tourists - I'm on kolto packing duty.
19814 := I'm sorry, I'm on duty, citizen. Please refer any questions to our diplomatic corp. Thank you.
19815 := Kolto sales seem to have dropped off considerably. The Selkath are no longer exporting it, it seems. A lot of them act like they're blaming us...
19816 := I have to get back to my post at the Republic Embassy. My break is almost over.
19817 := Tyvark hates the Sith, so he's always giving us Republic soldiers discounts. I bet he gives you Jedi a great deal.
19818 := I always shop here. Tyvark's prices are the best in the city.
19819 := The Selkath seem to be pretty cold to the Republic lately. It's almost like they blame us for the disappearance of the kolto.
19820 := The Selkath aren't harvesting kolto anymore. Something strange is going on... I bet the Sith are up to something!
19821 := Hi, Tyvark. I've got to stock up - they might be sending me to the front to battle the Sith.
19822 := I hope you win your glory by smashing their fleet, and return without injury.
19823 := You and me both, Tyvark. You and me both.
19824 := Hey, Tyvark - how's it going?
19825 := The Sith continue to befoul the beauty of this watery world. But otherwise, I am keeping well.
19826 := Ah, glad to hear it. This stuff's all for the Republic Embassy, so can you just bill it to them?
19827 := Of course, good soldier. I trust the Republic to pay its bills completely.
19828 := How much for all this stuff, Tyvark?
19829 := For the Sith - a month's pay! But since you are a member of the Republic, I will charge you a week's salary.
19830 := Thanks, Tyvark. Catch you next week..
19831 := Those Sith are always trying to goad us. Why don't the Selkath stop them?
19832 := I have to stop talking to Sith... they make me want to break so many laws just to pound the smirk off their faces!
19833 := If it wasn't for those damn Selkath neutrality laws, I'd teach that Sith a thing or two!
19834 := I can't do anything that would get me in trouble, or the Selkath might slap export penalties on the Republic.
19835 := We need the Selkath's kolto for the war effort against Malak.
19836 := As long as the Sith stay out of my way, I'll stay out of theirs.
19837 := I... I suppose you're right. You probably know best - you are a Jedi, after all. I guess getting mad doesn't help any.
19838 := Don't be such a coward - teach those Sith a lesson!
19839 := The Republic must respect the law.
19840 := You have to learn to control your anger. Anger leads to the dark side.
19841 := Can I help you with anything?
19842 := Ok, sure. Come back if you need anything.
19843 := I actually don't know much about it at all. It's some sort of facility the Republic built here wasn't it?
19844 := I'm not really cleared for that sort of information...
19845 := Can I help you with anything else?
19846 := That recording? I have no idea what it is. Its probably classified... and I don't have clearance for that sort of thing.
19847 := It might be something one of our intelligence agents picked up.
19848 := Can I help you with anything else?
19849 := The Sith encryption scheme on these cards is based on a sequence of simple mathematical principles.
19850 := We have managed to decode the majority of the encryption algorithm, by the final segments of the terminal sequences elude us.
19851 := If you think you are able, you can try to break the code on the card. Don't worry if you happen to ruin the card, the box we captured has a whole bunch of them.
19852 := Can I help you with anything else?
19853 := Did you do something to the computer? The operating layer seems a little sketchy... Maybe it's just another bug in the system.
19854 := Hey, great! You sliced the encryption on those cards! They change the codes regularly, so you'll have to use it pretty soon or not at all.
19855 := So you're the one who's going to try to get into the Sith base, eh? Heh. Good luck. You're going to need it.
19856 := This is our main computer room here. We've got the box of passcards we got from the Sith, but we haven't been able to break their encryption yet.
19857 := We have been able to decode the numeric system they use, but there are holes in our terminal sequence patterns.
19858 := Oh, OK. Well I'll just explain the encryption method anyway, you might need it if your passcode doesn't live up to expectations.
19859 := The encryption system is composed of 6 'matrices'. Each is based on a mathematical method. The holes we're missing are the final number in each of the strings.
19860 := Most are simple, but the final two matrices seem to be much more difficult.
19861 := The second-last matrix has a pattern looping back on itself, or something, and the last is divided into smaller subparts. Maybe the pattern for that is within each part...
19862 := But I have to admit, all this is a bit over my head. I haven't even been able to slice past the first matrix and I've been at this for hours.
19863 := I've ruined a dozen cards already... But the good thing is we have a whole box of them, so you don't have to worry about running out any time soon.
19864 := Since Roland said you were cleared, you can use the computer freely. I'll be here if you have any questions.
19865 := The strings of numbers that end the code sequences. If we could complete those strings, we would have the key to their encryption system.
19866 := Nothing for now.
19867 := What do you know about the Hrakert Facility?
19868 := What do you know about this data recording?
19869 := Tell me about the Sith encryption matrices.
19870 := I have a passcode to the Sith base.
19871 := What do I have to do?
19872 := What kind of holes?
19873 := Terminal sequences?
19874 := Obey the laws here on Manaan, human.
19875 := This is a private conversation, off-worlder.
19876 := You have done the Selkath a great service, off-worlder.
19877 := You are either brave or foolish, off-worlder, to walk our streets so boldly. Your kind are not popular on Manaan right now.
19878 := Interrupting another who is not interested in conversation is considered rude on this planet, off-worlder!
19879 := The case of Sunry from the Republic is a perfect example of why off-worlders should be expelled from Manaan!
19880 := The government may not be willing to say anything, but we citizens in the water know what you've done! You would best leave Manaan while you can!
19881 := Greetings, off-worlder. While I do not have time to converse with you, I hope you find what you are looking for here on Manaan.
19882 := The Sith have tried to manipulate our courts time and again, seeking power for themselves. I hope our government decides to do more against this.
19883 := I find it shocking that a hero of the Republic - Sunry - could do such a thing. Perhaps I have been wrong in my judgment of the Republic.
19884 := Many say that the Republic has had something to do with the economic restriction our people have placed on all trade. I hope it is not true.
19885 := I cannot sell you kolto unless you show me your purchase permit.
19886 := Good - I am far too busy to converse with the likes of you.
19887 := One does not simply 'get' a purchase permit! Such permits are brokered between intergalactic governments and the Ahto City Export Authority.
19888 := We do not sell unrefined kolto by the handful - we sell it by the ton! Go to a store if you wish to purchase kolto for personal use.
19889 := I am not here to answer your questions, off-worlder. I am a distributor of kolto - the lifeblood of the Manaan economy.
19890 := Either show me your purchase permit, or leave me in peace.
19891 := Then why are you here, human? Are you seeking employment? We do not hire your kind here.
19892 := Do you even have an off-worlder work permit? I thought not. I suggest you visit the courthouse in the district to the west, off-worlder. There is nothing for you here.
19893 := I'll be going now.
19894 := Where can I get a purchase permit?
19895 := I just want some information.
19896 := I don't have a permit.
19897 := Why are you disturbing me? Can you not see I am overseeing the packaging of this kolto?
19898 := Good! Your intrusion has already wrought havoc upon my hectic schedule.
19899 := The kolto is not mine - I am merely coordinator of this shipment. And you cannot simply 'buy' unrefined kolto!
19900 := Such negotiations are worked out between intergalactic governments and the Ahto City Export Authority. We transact deals in the billions of credits.
19901 := You obviously are in the wrong place, off-worlder. I suggest you visit the courthouse west of here - there you may be of some use to the Selkath instead of a hinderance.
19902 := I have far more pressing matters than any questions you might have, off-worlder. This kolto is the backbone of Manaan's economy.
19903 := I think I'll be going now.
19904 := I'd like to buy some of your kolto.
19905 := I just want to ask you questions.
19906 := I do not have time to talk to you, human. I have business to attend to.
19907 := The single most important law on Manaan is very simple. kolto smuggling is punishable by death. If you're carrying any unprocessed kolto, you better have a permit.
19908 := The other rule is also very simple - keep the peace. Here on Manaan we maintain a careful neutrality, and we react very harshly to people who jeopardize our neutral status.
19909 := Any confrontations between the Sith and Republic are dealt with swiftly and decisively. Is this understood?
19910 := The Sith respect the independence of Manaan as much as the Republic does. As long as we continue to control the production of a resource as valuable as kolto, we have no need to fear any conquering fleet. 
19911 := Should Manaan ever come under attack, we would destroy the supply of kolto and vanish beneath the oceans of our world. Even the Sith are not willing to risk the loss of a commodity as valuable as kolto.
19912 := Your opinion is biased by your own alliances, human. Only we Selkath can best protect the interests of Manaan and Ahto city.
19913 := Now leave me be before I have you removed. I have work to attend to.
19914 := Yes, we do. Now kindly leave before I have you removed. I have work to attend to.
19915 := Don't be foolish, human! Of course we have laws against murder, theft and other crimes. But these laws are hardly different than those of any other planet.
19916 := Manaan's neutrality is closely linked to our kolto production - that is why I made special mention of the laws regarding smuggling and keeping the peace.
19917 := Good. Now you can stop bothering me. I have work to do.
19918 := This law is especially important since the Manaan government has decided to restrict kolto exports for an indeterminate amount of time.
19919 := There is a docking fee of 100 credits. You will have to pay this fee each time you dock on Manaan, or you will not be permitted into Ahto city.
19920 := Then you won't be passing the gates into Ahto city. Feel free to leave Manaan whenever you wish. 
19921 := Should you decide to pay the fee, speak to me again and I will give you access to Ahto City.
19922 := [Failure] The amount of the fee is legislated by the Manaan board of trade and tourism. I am not at liberty to haggle on this matter.
19923 := The Manaan board of trade and tourism thanks you, off-worlder. Here is a visitor guide and map to the city. Refer to it should you have any questions. 
19924 := The gates of Ahto city are now open to you. You may come and go as you please, so long as you do not leave the planet. If you do, you will have to pay the docking fee once more.
19925 := Welcome to Manaan. There is a docking fee of 500 credits to gain access to Ahto City.
19926 := We need to find other sources of revenue since kolto production has been so drastically scaled back.
19927 := How did you... uh, I mean... 
19928 := For various political and economic reasons, the Selkath have limited the production of kolto. That is all you need to know, off-worlder.
19929 := This is a Selkath matter, human - I won't discuss it with you anymore. Are you going to pay the 500 credit docking fee or not?
19930 := [Failure] You... you try to manipulate my mind off-worlder! We do not tolerate such insolence and disrespect for authority here on Manaan!
19931 := You shall be detained and fined no less than 500 credits for this offence. If you cannot pay such a fine then you will rot in prison.
19932 := [Success] Ah. I see. Yes, you do not need to pay.
19933 := The Manaan board of trade and tourism thanks you, off-worlder. Here is a visitor guide to the city. Refer to it should you have any questions. 
19934 := The gates of Ahto city are now open to you. You may come and go as you please, so long as you do not leave the planet. If you do, you will have to pay the docking fee once more.
19935 := Welcome to Manaan. While you are here, I trust you will follow all the rules governing the activities of off-worlders.
19936 := Your dislike of us only seems matched by our dislike of you. Personal feelings do not factor into our legal system however. And ALL must obey our laws.
19937 := The single most important law on Manaan is very simple. Kolto smuggling is punishable by death. If you're carrying any unprocessed kolto, you better have a permit.
19938 := The other rule is also very simple - keep the peace. Here on Manaan we maintain a careful neutrality, and we react very harshly to people who jeopardize our neutral status.
19939 := Any confrontations between the Sith and Republic are dealt with swiftly and decisively. Is this understood?
19940 := The Sith respect the independence of Manaan as much as the Republic does. As long as we continue to control the production of a resource as valuable as kolto, we have no need to fear any conquering fleet. 
19941 := Should Manaan ever come under attack, we would destroy the supply of kolto and vanish beneath the oceans of our world. Even the Sith are not willing to risk the loss of a commodity as valuable as kolto.
19942 := Your opinion is biased by your own alliances, human. Only we Selkath can best protect the interests of Manaan and Ahto city.
19943 := Don't be foolish, human! Of course we have laws against murder, theft and other crimes. But these laws are hardly different than those of any other planet.
19944 := Manaan's neutrality is closely linked to our kolto production - that is why I made special mention of the laws regarding smuggling and keeping the peace.
19945 := I will be going now.
19946 := Can you tell me the laws of Manaan?
19947 := How can you be neutral when the Sith are trying to conquer everything?
19948 := That seems awfully short sighted...
19949 := You seem to have it all worked out.
19950 := That's it? Only two laws?
19951 := I understand.
19952 := I won't be paying the fee right now.
19953 := [Persuade] Make it 50 credits and you got a deal.
19954 := Very well. Here is the docking fee.
19955 := 500 credits? It used to be 100!
19956 := Scaled back? Don't you really mean kolto production has been destroyed?
19957 := [Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the docking fee.
19958 := Very well. Here is the docking fee.
19959 := Why did you lower kolto production?
19960 := Pathetic laws of pathetic fish don't concern me.
19961 := What are the rules, exactly?
19962 := How can you be neutral when the Sith are trying to conquer everything?
19963 := That seems awfully short sighted...
19964 := You seem to have it all worked out.
19965 := That's it? Only two laws?
19966 := I understand.
19967 := Don't worry, I'll follow the rules.
19968 := These Selkath don't know what they're going to miss. When the Sith Empire finally crushes the Republic, then we'll see how long their vaunted neutrality lasts.
19969 := We got revenge for Elassa in the trial! Finally we get some justice from those fish-headed freaks!
19970 := That slime Sunry got free after killing one of us! If I ever meet his Arbiter in the street...
19971 := Our Embassy has been closed temporarily because someone dropped a wrench in the elevator. And that's OFFICIAL!
19972 := The Selkath have slapped heavy export restrictions on kolto for everyone. Someone must have done something to piss them off. Damn Republic, I bet...
19973 := Stay out of my way. I'm on legitimate Sith business.
19974 := Everyone knows the Republic crippled the kolto production. Why don't the Selkath ban them from the planet?
19975 := We've got all the proper kolto trading permits, so back off.
19976 := I don't have time to listen to your stories - I've got a full shipment of kolto to load before my shift is over.
19977 := Kolto's real scarce all of a sudden. From what I hear, the Republic is to blame.
19978 := *groan* Uhh...
19979 := Malak will show you Republics how a war is really waged!
19980 := You Republics sicken me! We'll do the galaxy a favor by wiping you out!
19981 := What's this? Another Republic lackey wandering the streets? Don't worry - the Sith will destroy you along with all the rest who don't bow down before Malak!
19982 := Let me guess... Dark Lord of the Sith?
19983 := HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Revan, right?
19984 := HAHAHAHA! You moron! Revan's dead! And if you try to back up your stupid words with stupid deeds the Selkath will be all over you like a Mon Calamari during mating season.
19985 := Now some of us have serious work to do. *chuckle* Run along, fool.
19986 := Save your empty threats. If you're stupid enough to attack me the Selkath authorities will lock you away for a long, long time.
19987 := I have nothing more to say to you. I have important Sith business to tend to.
19988 := Your precious Republic's days are numbered! It won't be long until Malak turns his armada loose on Coruscant itself!
19989 := Save your empty threats, Sith scum! Malak isn't stupid enough to attack the Core worlds - not with the entire Republic fleet waiting for him!
19990 := You're a fool! When the Sith descend on Coruscant, our numbers will block out the sun itself! The galactic senators will collapse trembling in fear, and beg for mercy at Malak's feet!
19991 := You underestimate the Republic's resolve! We'll die before we surrender Coruscant!
19992 := That can be arranged. Remember what happened to Taris - Malak could do the same to the Core worlds!
19993 := He wouldn't dare!
19994 := Now it is you who underestimate our resolve.
19995 := Do you know who I am, worm?
19996 := And don't you forget it!
19997 := Yes... Yes I am.
19998 := Er... well... yeah.
19999 := Don't laugh!
20000 := I'll kill you!
20001 := Why you...
20002 := You'll want to change your tone. You wouldn't be the first Sith I've killed.
20003 := I have no wish to trade childish taunts and empty words with you.
20004 := I don't know how much longer I can stay on this world... The Selkath don't make it easy on us off-worlders.
20005 := A friend of mine recently got into Pazaak - you know, the card game. Now he can't stop! It's so addictive!
20006 := Wow! Hey, you're the sector swoop champ, right? Too bad about the circuit being so small this year, but still!
20007 := The whole swoop racing circuit for this sector has been falling apart since the Sith bombed Taris.
20008 := Did I tell you I'm a fan? I saw recordings of some of your races and you're great! Maybe when they get the circuit back up we can really see what you can do!
20009 := I hear there's going to be a heavy meteor shower in the Coruscant system this year. Last time this sort of thing happened, they lost one of the orbital stations.
20010 := I hear the Czerka Corp. got kicked off Kashyyyk by the locals... Good for them! At least someone's getting something back from them.
20011 := There's a lot of money to be made in the Republic in times like these. If we survive of course...
20012 := The fighting between the Republic and the Sith is spreading farther. I wonder how long before Manaan becomes a battleground...
20013 := I heard there's been some sort of revolt on one of the Sith worlds. Maybe the Republic would actually have a chance... if it weren't for Malak.
20014 := I heard the Sith are trying to work on a synthetic version of kolto. I wouldn't be surprised if the Republic was, too.
20015 := Manaan may not seem very hospitable, but a surprising amount of trade runs through it because of the kolto trade.
20016 := The Selkath have clamped down on kolto exports all of a sudden. No one knows why. If someone did something to offend them, there's going to be trouble I think.
20017 := Greetings, friend. I bid you a warm welcome to Tyvark's shop. My store is here to serve everyone - except the Sith who walk the city like roaches! 
20018 := As you wish, human. Please return when you have need of anything from my vast inventory.
20019 := Unfortunately, I cannot offer any great insight into this matter. I suggest you investigate the murder scene, or perhaps talk to the other residents of the hotel where the crime occured.
20020 := How can you ask such a question? They are cruel and ruthless, and care nothing for the welfare of others. And the Sith regard my species with particular disdain.
20021 := But my feelings about the Sith are well known around Ahto City. I shall spare you further outbursts. What may I do for you?
20022 := As you wish, human. My inventory contains the finest Aratech equipment you can find on Manaan - all of it far superior to the Czerka Corp swill the Sith are so fond of. 
20023 := Greetings, human. I welcome you to my store. But if you have come seeking med kits, I must apologize for the price in advance.
20024 := The Selkath say the kolto harvest is the lowest it has ever been, and healing salves have become extremely expensive.
20025 := I have heard from several customers that you are now the Arbiter during the murder trial of Sunry, the Republic war hero.
20026 := I admire you for accepting this position. I have no doubt Sunry has been framed by the Sith. If there is anything I can do to aid your investigation, I will be happy to help.
20027 := Welcome, welcome. This is a great time to be alive, as the Czerka Corp. has been driven from one of its outposts.
20028 := They lost their "trading" outpost on Kashyyyk - merely a slaver's den I've been told. News of this sort is welcome indeed to me. What can I do for you today?
20029 := Come in, come in! You honor my humble store with your presence. All of Manaan has heard tell of your glorious swoop riding exploits.
20030 := I carry many other choice items of the highest quality. Items a celebrity of your stature might be interested in.
20031 := Have you heard the news? They say the Sith slaughtered a secret Jedi oupost on Dantooine in a vile and cowardly sneak attack.
20032 := Yet despite this monstrous act, the Selkath authorities insist on maintaining their neutrality - and the Sith walk amongst us like vermin in the streets of Ahto City!
20033 := I think I'll be going now.
20034 := Do you know about the Sunry case?
20035 := Why do you dislike the Sith so much?
20036 := Let me see what you have in stock.

20178 := If you have any other questions you should probably see Roland Wann, he's the Republic diplomat here. He's by the Republic enclave near the visitor residences. Have a pleasant stay, Master Jedi.
20179 := Yeah, what do you...? Oh, I apologize Master Jedi, I should not have been rude.
20180 := Of course. If you have any other questions you should probably see Roland Wann, he's the Republic diplomat here. He's by the Republic enclave near the visitor residences.
20181 := If you don't know where that is, go north from here, then south past the port official and the first courtyard, east into the second courtyard, then north then east again. You got that?
20182 := Have a pleasant stay, Master Jedi.
20183 := Of course, I'm always willing to help a Jedi. What do you require?
20184 := A Star Map? Like an ancient artifact or something?
20185 := No, sorry, never heard of it.
20186 := Is there anything else I can do for you?
20187 := Um... It's big. Real big. Actually it's pretty much the only real city on the entire world. The only place for us air-breathers anyway.
20188 := Manaan is a water world - which you may have noticed on your way down to land here - inhabited natively by a species of fish-people called the Selkath.
20189 := They built this city to cater to us off-worlders and as a base of operations to export kolto, which is the only real thing they have to trade here.
20190 := The Selkath think that by staying neutral they can play both sides, selling kolto to everyone that needs it, and making themselves too valuable to be worth conquering.
20191 := Well, that, and they threatened to destroy the only natural source of kolto on the planet if anyone tries to attack them.
20192 := But I think they're underestimating the lengths the Sith will go to get what they want... They're probably planning something already.
20193 := Is there anything else you require?
20194 := You're joking... right?
20195 := Sorry, but everyone knows what kolto is. The most powerful healing agent in the galaxy. I would've died several times myself if we didn't have this stuff handy.
20196 := But the reason it's important here is that kolto is only found naturally on Manaan, and all of our attempts to synthesize it have failed miserably.
20197 := So we sit here on the surface, the Selkath harvesting what kolto bubbles up from the bottom of the ocean, and we buy it from them.
20198 := Us and the Sith of course. The Selkath don't want to play favorites.
20199 := Well, for the kolto, of course. Really that's the only reason anyone would want to be here. It's the only reason the Selkath built Ahto City in the first place: to export kolto.
20200 := These damn Sith are everywhere on Manaan, pushing us Republic citizens around, trying to goad us into breaking the law somewhere.
20201 := Peacefully? Not hardly. Just look in their eyes. You can see they'd like nothing more than to kill each and every one of us, personal-like.
20202 := If you say so, Master Jedi. It's very aggravating. Sometimes I just want to take one of them and... *grrr*
20203 := You're... you're joking, right? The smug Hutt-spawn push us every chance they can get and enjoy it.
20204 := There's nothing we can do, though. The Selkath want to maintain their neutrality and they enforce it VERY strictly.
20205 := So we have to sit here and let the Sith insult us and we can't raise a hand against them otherwise the Republic will face severe kolto export restrictions. That could lose us the war altogether.
20206 := The Selkath want to maintain their neutrality in this war we're fighting with the Sith and they enforce it VERY strictly.
20207 := No really, I should apologize. I should try to control myself... as you Jedi do.
20208 := Is there anything I can help you with?
20209 := Never mind, I must go.
20210 := I would like to ask a few questions.
20211 := Have you seen an ancient Star Map?
20212 := Who are the Selkath?
20213 := Tell me about Ahto City.
20214 := Why haven't they joined the Republic?
20215 := The Republic and Sith both stay here?
20216 := What is kolto?
20217 := Why are there Sith on Manaan?
20218 := Why do the Sith upset you so much?
20219 := The Sith and the Republic coexisting peacefully? Well... relatively...
20220 := It is the work of the dark side.
20221 := They mean well, but are misguided.
20222 := Yeah, I know the feeling...
20223 := Why don't you run them off Manaan?
20224 := Breaking the law?
20225 := It is alright.
20226 := People are saying the Republic did something to cripple the kolto production here on Manaan, but I don't believe it. Sounds more like something the Sith would do.
20227 := If you got a problem go talk to our diplomatic representative. Don't bother me with it.
20228 := I can't talk now. I have to get this kolto loaded up before my shift is over.
20229 := The Selkath have scaled back all kolto harvesting - but nobody is saying why. Good thing we've been stockpiling this stuff for the past year.
20230 := Hey - I'm working here! Go talk to the diplomatic rep if you got something to say.
20231 := I can't stop to talk to tourists - I'm on kolto packing duty.
20232 := You Republics make me sick. It's a good thing there are cameras all over the place on Manaan, or they'd have droids cleaning you up off the walls by now.
20233 := You Republic people are so pathetic, sitting around grovelling at the tablescraps the galactic senators deign to give you. It makes me sick.
20234 := The senators work for the good of the whole galaxy, not for individual gain!
20235 := Ha! Don't make me laugh, you gutless simp! It's the destiny of weak-minded fools like you to be ruled over by the strong, like we Sith!
20236 := I'm warning you! Don't push me, or you'll get just what you're asking for!
20237 := Try it. Just try it. I'd love to see you throw the first punch. And with all the cameras around the Selkath would be all over you inside of 30 seconds.
20238 := You break their laws, you pay the price, Republic scum. But I can see that you're not man enough to back up your words anyway.
20239 := If you ever feel like relieving yourself of your worthless existence, feel free to come by our enclave here. We have many, many ways to fulfill your wish.
20240 := *grrr*
20241 := Stay out of my way. I'm on legitimate Sith business.
20242 := Everybody knows the Republic crippled the kolto production. Why don't the Selkath ban them from the planet?
20243 := We've got all the proper kolto trading permits, so back off.
20244 := I don't have time to listen to your stories - I've got a full shipment of kolto to load before my shift is over.
20245 := Kolto's real scarce all of a sudden. From what I hear, the Republic is to blame.

20252 := Hey, Stranger! Mysterious Stranger! Wow, look at you... a Jedi! Heh. No wonder I could never beat you. It's me - Duncan. Deadeye Duncan. From the dueling arena on Taris. Remember?
20253 := Well, there were a handful of us who made it out. The lucky ones. I survived by breaking into the military base, overpowering a dozen Sith soldiers and stealing one of their own ships.
20254 := Oh, right. Okay. Goodbye then. I was just heading off planet anyway. Good to see you again, Stranger.
20255 := Well... when the bombing started the Sith sent down a bunch of auto-piloted ships to evacuate soldiers from the planet. I saw one and I figured it was a rescue ship, so I ran up to it.
20256 := A Sith patrol was approaching from the other side, getting ready to board. When they saw me they all pulled their blasters. But it takes more than a dozen armed Sith soldiers to slow me down!
20257 := Well, to tell the truth I didn't actually take the Sith out. A building fell on them. A chunk of building, actually. From the bombing. Crushed the whole bunch of them. Heh. Very messy.
20258 := So there I was, all alone and standing by this empty evacuation ship. I climbed on board, overrode the auto-pilot controls and lifted off into orbit.
20259 := The ship had all the Sith launch codes programmed in, so I didn't have to worry about being blasted from the sky. I just played it cool and tried to fly casual.
20260 := In the confusion of the bombing, nobody paid any attention to my one little ship slipping away from the fleet. Once I was out of scanner range, I knew I was home free.
20261 := I've decided to become a mercenary. I came here looking for work; I heard the Republic was hiring. But they weren't interested in me. I guess I made a mistake by telling them who I was.
20262 := They'd heard of me. Seems like everybody's heard of me. The legend of Deadeye Duncan, the worst duelist of all time, has spread far and wide across the galaxy. Makes it hard to earn a living, you know.
20263 := I have no idea. All I know is that if I don't find some way to shake my reputation soon I'm going to have to find another line of work. It's too bad... hey, wait a minute!
20264 := You're a Jedi now, so you probably won't be doing much dueling anymore, right? So the name Mysterious Stranger probably won't be much use to you anymore, right? So, uh... could I have it?
20265 := I mean, if everyone's heard of Deadeye Duncan then they've probably heard of the Mysterious Stranger. But nobody knows anything about you except the name. You could be anybody: man, woman... me.
20266 := If I say I'm the Mysterious Stranger, who's going to know? There'll be celebrity tours, maybe some endorsements... I could milk this thing for months. Well, right up until people see me fight.
20267 := What do you say? Fame, celebrity: you don't need that. You're a Jedi! But I'm just a guy trying to earn a living. Come one, give me a break.
20268 := Okay, okay. Settle down. No need to get violent. We're not in the duel ring right now.
20269 := Eh, just forget I ever mentioned it. It was a dumb idea. I'll figure something out on my own.
20270 := I probably should be going now, anyway. I'm heading off planet. Maybe I can find work somewhere else. Somewhere they've never heard of Deadeye Duncan. Goodbye, Stranger.
20271 := Really? You mean it? Oh, this is great! Heh! No more jokes, no more snickering! When I tell people I'm the Mysterious Stranger they'll finally treat me with respect.
20272 := Thanks a lot, Stranger. Oops, heh. I guess I shouldn't call you that now. People will think I'm talking to myself. Ha-ha!
20273 := Anyway, I should be going. I'm heading off planet to look for work. Shouldn't be too hard, now that I'm the Taris duel champion! It was good seeing you again... and thanks.
20274 := I'm glad to see you made it off of Taris alive... things were pretty bad when the Sith started their bombardment. But I guess getting off the planet would be easy for a Jedi, huh?
20275 := How did you escape Taris?
20276 := Good, I'm happy for you. Goodbye.
20277 := Yeah, right. Why don't you tell me what really happened.
20278 := You overpowered a dozen Sith?
20279 := Do you expect me to believe this?
20280 := So what are you doing here?
20281 := Great story. Goodbye.
20282 := So what are you going to do now?
20283 := Why is the Republic hiring mercenaries?
20284 := You'll never pull this off.
20285 := You want to tell them you're the champion?
20286 := If I ever find out you're impersonating me, I'll slice you open!
20287 := No, you can't take my credit.
20288 := Okay, the name is yours.
20289 := You were pretty easy to slow down inside the dueling ring.

20347 := We shall give you a chance to prove your claims against the Sith, human.

20349 := Your death will bring glory to our new Sith Master!
20350 := Have you brought us evidence to back up your accusations? Have you found proof the Sith are evil, as you claim?

20352 := Intruders! Should we sound the alarm, Shasa?
20353 := No - wait. We cannot always be running to the Masters for help. We should handle this on our own.
20354 := Perhaps this is a test the Sith have prepared for us?
20355 := What are you doing here? Only Masters and Apprentices are allowed in here.
20356 := You won't find us to be such easy vitcims! Our Sith Masters have taught us well!
20357 := I told you your father would get suspicious, Shasa! He always hated the Sith!

20360 := Republic propaganda. The Sith are the victims of lies and half truths! They are not monsters - no more so than the Republic.
20361 := The Sith have promised to guide us in the use of the Force, as a sign of their good faith. And once the Republic is defeated, the Sith have promised to withdraw from Manaan and respect our independence.
20362 := Ah, I see you are not as foolish as the others I have met. It is good to see that the Jedi Order also realizes the strength of the Sith, and will do what is right when the time comes.
20363 := If you encounter my father, tell him I will not return to him. I have cast my lot with the Sith and that is all.
20364 := Spare us your lies! The Sith have treated us with nothing but respect and honor!
20365 := You speak as if we are prisoners here, but we can leave whenever we wish! Our friend Galas chose to leave, and he was returned safely to his home in Ahto City.
20366 := Shasa, what if they speak the truth? Remember what happened at Taris...
20367 := Taris is nothing but a Republic lie! If the Sith are such monsters, then prove it to us. Surely there must be some evidence of the horrors they commit!
20368 := Shasa - this is the Master's own datapad! Look - they are speaking the truth!
20369 := I... I cannot believe it. And yet, the evidence is right before me. The Sith wanted to use us to betray Manaan!
20370 := I must apologize for doubting you. The Sith are truly as evil as you have claimed.
20371 := We must report this to the Ahto City authorities!
20372 := Yes - we must report this at once. We thank you, human, for showing us the truth. You have saved us from a terrible mistake.
20373 := Quickly, my friends - we can stay here no longer. We must flee this foul embassy and warn our people against the plot to corrupt the Manaan youth.
20374 := Just be careful with those gifts you've already learned. Beware the dark side... or you may end up betraying your world regardless.
20375 := You have been saved from more than you know. Given time, the Sith would have turned you fully to the dark side... and you would have betrayed your world gladly.
20376 := Shasa - this is the pin I gave Galas when we were children. There is blood on it.
20377 := You could have found this anywhere! For all we know, you killed Galas!
20378 := [Failure] I don't know if we should believe them, Shasa.
20379 := The pin is not enough. I am still not convinced the Sith are the monsters you claim. You must find more definite evidence if we are to believe you.
20380 := Use the Force, then. Look into your heart and you will realize what is truth and what is lies.
20381 := [Success] Shasa - I believe them. How else would they have found this pin?
20382 := I... I didn't want to believe it, but I can no longer deny what I know to be true. Galas is dead, and the Sith are responsible.
20383 := So you say. But why should we believe you? We need physical proof, not the words of some Republic sympathizer.
20384 := [Failure] Do you think we are weak minded fools? Our Sith Masters have taught us how to resist such simple Jedi mind tricks!
20385 := You have no proof of your claims - that is why you must resort to such tactics to make us believe you. The Sith would not try deceive us like this!
20386 := [Success] Shasa, I think the Sith are evil. I want to go home.
20387 := Yes - the Sith are evil. We must leave and never come back.
20388 := I can understand why you're doing this, but surely it can't be that hard to *prove* the evil of the dark side, can it?
20389 := Oh-ho! Is this how you win an argument? I would have thought it easier to prove the evil of the dark side than that.
20390 := [Failure] I will not give you time to gather lies and false evidence! You are an enemy of the Sith - and now you are an enemy of the Selkath as well!
20391 := We shall make our Masters proud by slaying you!
20392 := [Persuade] Spoken like a true Sith. They wouldn't wait for proof either, I'm sure.
20393 := [Persuade] Wait! If you do not allow us time to prove our claims, you act just like you claim the Sith not to be!
20394 := [Success] Shasa, I think we should give them a chance to prove themselves.
20395 := We will not report your presence to our Sith Masters yet. If you bring us proof of Sith lies and torture we will return to our families and report this to the Ahto City authorities.
20396 := Until then we shall stay here and continue our training in the ways of the Force.
20397 := Well, great! It can't be that hard to find proof of the Sith's activities... can it?
20398 := Yes... certainly you must have heard of the destruction of Taris. It is your 'honorable' friends that committed that atrocity.
20399 := I haven't found the evidence yet.
20400 := Selkath, Sith - I'm just here to kill anyone in my way!
20401 := I am <FullName>. Shaelas has me investigating the disappearance of young Selkath.
20402 := I am <FullName>. What are you Selkath doing inside the Sith embassy?
20403 := If you ally with the Sith, then you'll suffer their fate - death!
20404 := The Sith are evil! What they told you was a lie.
20405 := Good, I knew the Sith would win.
20406 := The Sith just want to corrupt you!
20407 := If the Republic is defeated, the Sith will enslave your planet!
20408 := This datapad proves the Sith are lying to you!
20409 := I found a young Selkath dying from torture here. He gave me this...
20410 := [Persuade] The Sith tortured him to death, Shasa. You know it's true.
20411 := The Sith are evil, Shasa. They will use you to conquer Manaan for the kolto. 
20412 := The Sith are evil, Shasa. They only want Manaan's kolto.
20413 := [Force Persuade] The Sith are evil. You want to leave this place and never return.
20414 := [Persuade] Give me some time, and I will find proof the Sith are evil.
20415 := You there! I don't recognize you! How did you get in here?
20416 := [Failure] You... I don't recognize you! I know the face of every Sith on the planet! We'll get to the bottom of this!
20417 := [Failure] Ha! I don't recognize you and I know every Sith on this planet! We'll get to the bottom of this!
20418 := Commander Grann, report to the security desk immediately!
20419 := Yes? What is it?
20420 := You authorized this person to enter?
20421 := Yes, they had the proper authorization to enter...
20422 := I don't know them... and their identification doesn't match up! They're spies!
20423 := What?! Sound the alarm! Droids, destroy them!
20424 := Your pass-code is out of date! And I don't recognize you at all! We'll get to the bottom of this soon enough!
20425 := Your pass-card is out of date! And I don't recognize you at all! We'll get to the bottom of this soon enough!
20426 := [Force Persuade] We are authorized to be here.
20427 := [Lie] I don't have to tell you! I have higher authority!
20428 := I know the pass code.
20429 := I have a passcard.
20430 := How did you get in here? Wait - I recognize you!
20431 := Lord Malak was most displeased when he learned you had escaped Taris alive! He has promised a great reward to whoever destroys you.
20432 := Master, give us the honor of aiding you in destroying this enemy of the Sith.
20433 := As you wish, my eager apprentices. We shall remove this thorn from Malak's side once and for all!
20434 := Let's bring this on!
20435 := See? What did I tell you?
20436 := Commentary: It is not possible to destroy the master. It is suggested you run while my blasters warm up, meatbags.
20437 := Well, let me guess! You intend to collect this reward, right?

20507 := Where did you go? How did you get back here without being eaten?
20508 := You just got lucky! Or... or it's waiting for me to go back before eating me!
20509 := No!!! Whatever's out there will eat me too! Eat all of us!
20510 := You can't make me! I won't go!
20511 := When the Republic sends a real team down, they'll save me! They'll kill the monster and then we'll all leave safely!
20512 := If you're going to go into the rest of the station, don't expect me to help you... the Selkath will rip you all apart!
20513 := I don't know... I don't know why! But I'm not going to take my chances out there... It's waiting for me, I know it!
20514 := Nonono! It will eat us all up if we go out there! At least I'm safe here behind this door. The Selkath can't get me in here.
20515 := How... how did you get in? Did they send another submersible? Quick, we have to get out of here, we have to get away!
20516 := No! No! We have no time, we have to leave now! I managed to close the door after they killed everyone else, but I don't know how long it will hold.
20517 := The Selkath, they went crazy! They started killing anything that moved. Someone must have triggered the defense systems too, 'cause all the droids activated as well.
20518 := I was one of the mercs the Republic sent down here to find out what happened. We came down and secured the first couple rooms... there were bodies everywhere...
20519 := And the Selkath came out... screaming and croaking their fishy little war-cries.
20520 := They're dead! All dead! They swarmed out and over us. There was no way we could stop them.
20521 := So we ran... But hardly any of us made it. I locked the door behind us, bu... but the others had already left in the submersible!
20522 := The sharks... the firaxa out there and... worse... I heard an explosion shortly after the submersible left. They didn't make it. Just food for the sharks and the Selkath... like us.
20523 := What!? No! You're one of them! You'll never get me!
20524 := That doesn't mean its not still out there! Watching.. waiting...
20525 := Back to the surface. Yes... NO!! There's something out there... it got the other submersible already.
20526 := We can't leave until you do something. Blow up the entire station maybe. That might distract whatever it is long enough for us to escape to the surface.
20527 := But all the machinery and stuff is in the southern half, and that's been flooded! There might still be environmental suits around but... but... the Selkath might have laid their eggs in them!
20528 := You got a better idea for us getting you out of here, huh?
20529 := Suggestion: Perhaps we could dismember the organic? It would make it easier for transport to the surface.
20530 := Hey! Y-you... you can't just rip me to pieces! I'll die!!
20531 := Beep! Beep! Boop!
20532 := Amendment: I did forget that. Stupid, frail, non-compartmentalized organic meatbags!
20533 := Then how are we supposed to get you out of here?
20534 := No! I locked the door so that the Selkath won't get in. If you open it, we're all done for!
20535 := If you go in there, you're dead! You're all dead!
20536 := If you want to die, then go! You won't hear me mourning for you! I'll stay here and be safe until some sort of REAL rescue comes!
20537 := Don't get your hopes up too high. I have no intention of dying.
20538 := They swarmed out and over us. There was no way we could stop them.
20539 := I don't know what you're talking about. I've never seen any map, just stinking, reeking death.
20540 := We have to! We have to leave! The Selkath, they went crazy! They started killing anything that moved. Someone must have triggered the defense systems too, 'cause all the droids activated as well.
20541 := Cause I'm better than you.
20542 := Come with us back to the surface.

20548 := What happened here?
20549 := What happened to the scientists?
20550 := You snivelling worm! You're just food for the Selkath!
20551 := I didn't see anything...
20552 := Let's get you back to the surface.
20553 := Wait here while I go into the station.
20554 := I have to get into the station.
20555 := I have to get into the station.
20556 := You call yourself a mercenary?

20562 := I am not going anywhere.
20563 := Who are you?
20564 := Why? What happened?
20565 := Is somebody out there? Fishy, fishy, fishy? Coming to eat me, too? You can't get me little fishy. Not in here. I'm safe behind my walls.
20566 := Ha-ha! That's what you think! Fishy think that too. These walls and door are six centimeters - no... twelve centimeters! - of durasteel! I'm invulnerable behind my walls! Nobody's getting in here! *crazy, manic laughter*
20567 := When the Selkath went insane and started killing everybody, I locked myself in here! I'm safe in here. Nothing can hurt me in here! No fishy food for me.
20568 := Bye-bye. Go look for fishy people. They'll chomp and bite and chomp and bite. Food for fishy - that's you.
20569 := Nooooooo! You can't harm me in here! I'm invincible!
20570 := Aieeeeee!
20571 := [Failure] No, no, no, no, no. That's what the others said. Mercenaries like you. But they're dead. The Selkath ate them! Lunchie-munchie!
20572 := Only the ones left in the south part of the base might still be alive, where the kolto is. Few fishies there! But many, many fishy in between in the water!
20573 := Don't know. Go ask them. Ha-ha-ha!
20574 := When the demon screamed it shook every mind in the station. We fell to the ground, but survived. Fishy, fishies, though, they just got hungry!
20575 := Oh, you'd like that - wouldn't you? I walk out and - BAM! Selkath swarm in from everywhere, ripping and rending! Fishy move fast and silent.
20576 := No, no, no friend. I don't play that game. I've got a winning hand right here in this room - my room! No fishy, fishy for me!
20577 := Investigate? You're just like the others - fodder for the Selkath. Walking fish snacks. Chomp, chomp, chomp - if you can run you might be fast food.
20578 := Come out from there right now, or we'll blast our way in!
20579 := If you don't come out, I'll just leave you in there.
20580 := I'll carve you into little fish-bits!
20581 := [Insert lightsaber into locker.]
20582 := [Force Persuade] You want to come out of that room. You feel safe with us.

20584 := What made the Selkath insane?
20585 := Why don't you come out here?

20723 := Besides, it's a lot safer out here. No Selkath looking to make a meal out of us.
20724 := If you want to kill me, you'll have to catch me first! 
20725 := Who's there? You're not Selkath, I can see that much. Are you another rescue crew?
20726 := What? No - I didn't survive this long just to get killed by you!
20727 := Isn't it obvious - the Selkath have gone insane! They're killing everything that moves!
20728 := Oh, I'm a merc the Republic hired a couple days ago to investigate - but all we found was a bunch of insane Selkath killing everything that moves!
20729 := All my companions are dead. The Selkath swarmed over us - there were dozens of them! And they...they looked wrong, somehow. Like something had changed inside them. Insane or something...
20730 := Oh, I'd have gone back to the surface long ago if this complex hadn't been overrun by all those crazy Selkath! There's no way for me to get to the submarine docking bay.
20731 := I discovered a way to get to the bay and seal off the rest of the base. I just have to find the kolto harvester they built on the edge of the Hrakert rift. 
20732 := It's got an emergency override to open the doors to the submarine docking bay and I could get in from the outside.
20733 := I figured my only chance was to slap on an environment suit, head out onto the ocean floor and check that harvester out for myself.
20734 := Besides, it's got to be safer out on the ocean floor than back in there with all those crazed Selkath mutants running around looking for dinner.
20735 := I'm not spending another minute in this facility - not with those psychotic fish people all over the place!
20736 := I'm heading out to the ocean floor right now - it leads to another complex of buildings. Going through them is the only way to reach the kolto harvester.
20737 := We should probably stick together, but I won't wait around in here with the Selkath. You can catch up with me if you want - down the hall and through the doors on the right. I'll be waiting on the ocean floor where it's safe.
20738 := Psychotic fish just don't try to dodge as much.
20739 := They looked wrong? Hmmm... this whole place smells wrong. Like an Urellian urgoth egg gone bad in the hamper.
20740 := Doesn't smell so bad to me, old man.
20741 := Must be those reliable and finely tuned senses of yours, mercenary.
20742 := Changed inside them? Yes... this whole place feels wrong, somehow.
20743 := You're not a Selkath - but I think I'm going to kill you anyway!
20744 := Who are you?
20745 := What's going on down here?
20746 := I am <FullName>. The Republic sent us down to investigate.
20747 := What are you doing in the underwater section of the facility?
20748 := I still need to investigate...
20749 := You wait here - I'll go check it out.
20750 := Okay, I'll come with you.

20825 := After you've made it past the monster safely you can look for this Star Map of yours and unlock the door to the submersible docking bay.

20827 := No offense, but we'd rather wait for them than go with you - even if we're stuck here a few more days. Just get back to the surface afterwards, and the Republic will take care of us.
20828 := No! No! The firaxa will get us! No! The Selkath are coming! No!
20829 := No! No!
20830 := Eeeee! No!
20831 := You... Sami! Sami, calm down! I don't think they're here to kill us.
20832 := Eee... Kono.... Are... are they?
20833 := Yes. I think they're here to help us.
20834 := I... I'm sorry for what I did. I don't know what came over me. I... I just panicked when I heard someone outside the door. *Sigh* Please, forgive me. I'm just so scared.
20835 := We're both just scared.
20836 := When the Selkath went crazy I thought everyone else except me and Sami went mad. We had a few people outside the station when it happened...
20837 := The... firaxan sharks just tore them apart... It was like they were frenzied...
20838 := The next thing we knew our Selkath researchers started screaming and... and clawing at everything around them. My team... my team was torn apart and eaten before my eyes!
20839 := Sami and me... I... I thought we were the only ones left. We heard the Selkath outside at the doors every once in a while... and those strange noises echoing through the base.
20840 := We... thought everyone was dead... dead or insane.
20841 := I must have been hysterical, I... I don't know what I can say... I truly apologize for the horrible mistake I was making.
20842 := I am Kono Nolan, and this is Sami. We were scientists working here on the Hrakert Rift project.
20843 := We don't know! Not for sure...
20844 := The work teams were outside in the Rift near the vent. Then there was this rumbling and my head felt like it was splitting open...
20845 := This... this monster rose up from the Rift...
20846 := It was a firaxa shark I think... bigger than any I'd ever seen before. Bigger than our submersibles.
20847 := It was like it was screaming inside my head...
20848 := Then all the Selkath started screaming too... and they turned on us.
20849 := It may... It may have been. Maybe it was protecting the ruins by the Rift.
20850 := Well... maybe it was protecting the ruins by the Rift.
20851 := It could have been. It might have a lair in the Hrakert Rift near the kolto vent. Hm... that may explain a few things, too...
20852 := We had no clue at all... until it came out.
20853 := Maybe what ever sort of power it used to drive the Selkath insane masked it from us somehow... or maybe it was lying dormant deeper in the Rift.
20854 := I think it might live there. Live there because of the kolto.
20855 := Hm... maybe. That would explain more...
20856 := I don't know. It seems impossible, but...
20857 := Like why it reacted so violently when our construction efforts got closer to the vent.
20858 := And also why it is so large. It must be feeding off the kolto. It would have to be ancient indeed for it to reach that size. But with kolto as a food source...
20859 := And all those other firaxan sharks! Those might be its offspring!
20860 := Which would be why they all swarmed when it called out to them... Children coming to protect their mother.
20861 := That would be suicide... It's out there still.
20862 := I don't know. It must still be out there.
20863 := Out there waiting for us...
20864 := The firaxan sharks have always been a serious problem. We had some blasters and projectile cannons to defend against them, but they still got some of our workers from time to time.
20865 := We were working on a soluble chemical compound that would drive them away. Something that smelled or tasted repulsive to them, but we never got it working right.
20866 := Oh, I think not! Even flawed like it is, it should be ideal for this situation.
20867 := No! It's not working right! You don't know what it will do!
20868 := The repellant we made was supposed to drive firaxan sharks away, but we never got very far in its development.
20869 := The one we tested instead was violently toxic to them, rupturing their outer skin in seconds and preventing them from drawing oxygen from the water by clogging their intakes.
20870 := Which is exactly what we need in this situation! Something to kill that monster shark that destroyed our station!
20871 := But we don't know how else the chemical reacts! We only tried it in a controlled environment. In the open ocean, who knows what it could do... it could even affect the kolto.
20872 := We know exactly what it will do: it will kill the shark. That's what we designed it to do.
20873 := You don't need to do anything else. We have a cannister of the toxin here right now. We were working on it before the giant firaxan drove all the Selkath insane.
20874 := All you need to do is insert it into the main kolto harvester and have it vent it.
20875 := Get away as soon as you can. We don't know how much worse it will affect the giant firaxan shark.
20876 := Well, the monster seems to have been driven out by the machinery we installed at the edge of the Rift. We've seen it out there on the cameras bashing itself against the machines.
20877 := I think if you could destroy the machinery we installed, the shark would calm down and retreat back into its lair inside the Rift.
20878 := I AM sure.
20879 := You can reprogram the harvesting machines to overpressure their self-oxidizing fuel, so that the fuel tank cannisters will rupture and the entire machine will destroy itself.
20880 := The Hydrolium gas we use is a gas at 1 to 3 million sangen, a liquid at about 4 million sangen, and a solid above that. When it's a liquid it's VERY explosive.
20881 := If you inject enough of the Hydrolium gas into the tank, the pressure will be so great that it will turn to liquid form and start a chain reaction inside the machine.
20882 := But we'll lose everything we've built here! All those years of work!
20883 := It's better than whatever your chemical will do to the water!
20884 := What? No!
20885 := Run, Kono! She's one of them!
20886 := Run, Kono! He's one of them!
20887 := Good! Destroying the machinery will be better in the long run. We can't risk damaging the environment or the kolto.
20888 := You'll have to break into the computer on the harvesting machine and fiddle with the fuel injectors to get the tank pressure up to the point where the Hydrolium will liquidize.
20889 := Once the machinery is gone, the shark should leave.
20890 := That won't work and you know it! We have to vent the toxin from the harvesting machine. Once the shark is dead, we can get back to mining the kolto.
20891 := You know it's the right thing to do. It can't go wrong.
20892 := Just put the cannister into the machine and have it vent it into the Rift. The firaxan shark should die in no time.
20893 := No! You shouldn't do that! It could poison everything!
20894 := Just reprogram the harvesting machine's computer to overpressure the fuel tanks. Once it's destroyed, the shark should just leave.
20895 := You know what you have to do.
20896 := I just hope you make the right choice.
20897 := Wait! Don't! We don't know what effect the toxin will have on the ocean environment around the Rift!
20898 := It could poison the water against all life. It could poison the kolto itself, even! There is another way...
20899 := You can take this cannister of toxin. We were working on it just before the giant shark drove all the Selkath insane.
20900 := It was like they couldn't control themselves... like the sound that the monster was making in our heads drove them insane.
20901 := Look, I'm sorry! I've just been under a LOT of strain recently. You know, the whole thing about having my entire research team DEVOURED BEFORE MY EYES!!
20902 := Kono. Kono, calm down.
20903 := Don't talk to him like that! We've gone through a lot, and we said we're sorry for the mistake we made!
20904 := Just... I am sorry for my actions. But... but what are you doing here?
20905 := Oh.... okay. What is it you want to know?
20906 := Well, we're not too clear ourselves just exactly what happened...
20907 := A Star Map? I don't know of anything about a Star Map down here.
20908 := But... there were some ruins that were excavated when we were digging the foundations for the last section of the kolto harvesting machine.
20909 := But we can't go anywhere near those now! Maybe... maybe that's why it all happened in the first place...
20910 := We had a secret agreement with moderates in the Selkath government. They knew that Manaan could not survive independently if the Sith were victorious.
20911 := Those thugs would wipe out the whole damn planet just to get at the kolto.
20912 := So the Republic approached them about making this secret installation to harvest more kolto where the Sith couldn't see us.
20913 := But that all went horribly, horribly wrong...
20914 := I suppose that explains a lot. You've been under a lot of strain, here.
20915 := How horrible! I can only imagine how frightened you were.
20916 := What - what do you want? Go away! You'll let the firaxa and the Selkath in! They'll get us like they got all the others!
20917 := [Success] Yes. You are a friend. You'll protect us. You won't let the firaxa eat us. You'll keep the Selkath away.
20918 := No... the firaxa... the... the Selkath... I... I can't let you in. They'll get us!
20919 := No, no, no. Don't do it!
20920 := [Failure] No... I can't. The Selkath will get me! The firaxa will eat us! I can't! I can't!
20921 := [Success] I... I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt anyone.
20922 := I'll unlock the door, but you have to come in quickly!
20923 := No - no, you can't come in here! You'll let the firaxa and the Selkath in! No - stay out! Stay out!
20924 := I won't let you open the door for those monsters to get in! I'll stop you! I'll suck all the pressure out of the chamber! That'll stop you!
20925 := Kill them! Kill them now!
20926 := I saw what happened on the camera... and I can't believe what you did.
20927 := How could you willfully destroy the kolto harvesting machinery?! That will set us back years!
20928 := I will have you know that when we get back to the surface I'll have the Republic do a full inquiry into your actions!
20929 := Now go back to the surface and get the Republic to send a REAL rescue team down for us.
20930 := We were watching you on the cameras, and I want you to know that you did the right thing. Killing that shark probably saved us all.
20931 := I'm sure the kolto will be fine. A few impurities that may have got in should be flushed out in no time.
20932 := Just hurry up and get back to the surface and get the Republic to send down a real rescue team. We'll be waiting here for you.
20933 := Stop screaming!
20934 := I'm a friend. I'll protect you. You're both safe now.
20935 := Calm down... everything will be okay.
20936 := Why did the Selkath all go crazy?
20937 := It was protecting something?
20938 := What did the shark have to do with that?
20939 := And no one knew about this thing?
20940 := How could you miss something that big living there?
20941 := Like what?
20942 := The Star Map I'm looking for is out there. I need to get past.
20943 := I have to get to the kolto machinery.
20944 := Where is this monster firaxan now?
20945 := So what can I do about it?
20946 := What does this compound do?
20947 := What compound?
20948 := What else could I do?
20949 := What other choice do I have, though?
20950 := I am not so sure...
20951 := How would I do that?
20952 := I'll do what I want... and kill both of you as well!
20953 := I will try to destroy the harvesting machine.
20954 := I will try to poison the shark.
20955 := OK. I'll vent the toxin into the Rift to kill the giant shark.
20956 := How would I poison the shark?
20957 := What are you talking about?
20958 := Turned on you?
20959 := You tried to kill me!
20960 := How about I ask the questions.
20961 := The Republic wants me to find out what happened here.
20962 := I'm on a mission for the Jedi Council to find pieces of a Star Map.
20963 := What are you babbling about?
20964 := Something happened in the ruins?
20965 := What happened?
20966 := Have you seen a Star Map?
20967 := What was the Republic doing here?
20968 := Did the Sith do something?
20969 := Did this have something to do with a Star Map?
20970 := What happened?
20971 := You have a lot to answer for!
20972 := Open this door or you'll wish the Selkath had got you!
20973 := [Force Persuade] I'm a friend. You want to let me in. You want to stop the depressurization sequence.
20974 := Please - we're going to die if you don't stop the sequence!
20975 := No - I'm <FullName> and I'm here to help you. But first you have to stop the depressurization sequence.
20976 := [Persuade] I'll keep you safe. I promise. But you have to let me in.
20977 := I think we're just going to sit here. We have a lot of food and water, so we should be alright for a while.
20978 := If you can make it out to the kolto harvesting machines, try to reprogram them to self destruct. Maybe that will cause the creature to stop its psychic screams.
20979 := Once you do that, you can open the doors to the submersible bay and go back to the surface. Make sure you tell the Republic there are still some survivors down here.
20980 := Kono says he won't leave, and I can't leave him here by himself. We'll stay and wait until the Republic sends a larger rescue mission. Please don't delay too long!
20981 := We saw what you did out there on the cameras...
20982 := Why did you have to poison the water?? We don't know what effect it could have on the environment around here... or on the kolto.
20983 := Whatever it is that's coming out of the vent now doesn't look the same at all... I only hope you didn't pollute whatever was making it... We never were able to synthesize it.
20984 := Destroying the machinery was the right thing to do, for everyone.
20985 := That creature... the giant firaxan shark, the guardian of the kolto or whatever it was, seems to have calmed down a lot. It may even be safe to go outside now.
20986 := But we'll still stay here and wait for the Republic rescue crews. Thank you for not making a huge mistake.

21110 := Star Forge
21111 := I will stay here in this chamber and use my Battle Meditation to aid the Republic fleet. I am their only hope of destroying the Star Forge and ending the Sith menace.
21112 := You must go and face Malak, but you have to hurry. Once I turn the battle in the Republic's favor we won't have much time to escape the Star Forge before it is destroyed.
21113 := Good luck... and may the Force be with you.
21114 := Good luck, my love... and may the Force be with you.
21115 := No, this is not possible! You have rejected the dark side, you are a weak and pathetic servant of the light! How can you still stand against me? Why can't I defeat you?
21116 := Yes, I see you speak the truth. I am no match for you. Please, for the sake of what we once shared, do not make me suffer. End my life quickly. There is no other way.
21117 := Do it. Quickly...
21118 := What other choice do you have? I have fallen to the dark side, I am the apprentice to the Dark Lord himself. You cannot let me live.
21119 := You were a special case. The Council had no other choice. They needed you alive so they could discover the location of the Star Forge. It was an act of desperation.
21120 := It was my responsibility to watch over you, to make sure you did not slip back into your evil ways. I was supposed to protect you from the dark side.
21121 := It's true I possess... feelings for you. But was it only an illusion brought about by our bond? And what was the cost?
21122 := Please... this is too painful. End it now, quickly. There is no other way.
21123 := [Success] You... love me? Heh. I... there was a time I yearned for and yet dreaded to hear those words. I loved you, too, but I could never... face who you were.
21124 := Malak knew how I felt. Any part of the light that was within me would be extinguished when I killed you.
21125 := But what good is love? It cannot save me from the sea of blackness I am drowning in. I have betrayed everything I ever believed in! How can I atone for that?
21126 := I... I suppose you are right. Yet the path I have chosen is that of the dark side. I don't see any way I could atone for what I have done. I deserve to die.
21127 := But at what cost? In protecting you, I fell to the dark side myself. Is that the price of a Jedi's redemption? Must another of the Order fall to save me?
21128 := I cannot allow that to happen. Please, this is too painful. Strike me down. End this now, quickly. There is no other way.
21129 := That means nothing! I was a mere Padawan who had not completed her training, but you were a Jedi Knight - a proven champion of the light! You cannot compare us.
21130 := No... I'm not strong enough. There is too much anger inside me now. Too much hatred and fear. I can no longer find peace in the Force.
21131 := [Failure] The Jedi code is nothing but words, the babblings of senile old Masters! The code cannot help me now!
21132 := I ask you for an honorable death, but you are too weak to even grant me that! No more words! This must end with blood!
21133 := [Success] I doubt mere words can help me now, but to appease you I will recite them:
21134 := There is no emotion: there is peace. There is no ignorance: there is knowledge. There is no passion: there is serenity. There is no chaos: there is harmony... 
21135 := Strange, but even now I find comfort in these words. I... suppose old habits die hard.
21136 := There is no death: there is the Force. Thank you, Revan. I am ready to face my fate now.
21137 := Yes, I... could join you in your battle against the Dark Lord. That alone would not make up for all I have done, yet... it would be a step in the right direction.
21138 := But how would you be able to trust me? How do you know I wouldn't turn on you when you faced Darth Malak? How do you know the dark side wouldn't make me betray you again?
21139 := A wise decision. You cannot trust me, and you cannot bring yourself to execute me. I see now there is only one way this can end. The time for words is done! Defend yourself!
21140 := You play a dangerous game. Are you certain you wish to take this risk? I could end your life and gain Malak's favor with a single stroke of my lightsaber.
21141 := You are brave... and foolish. The dark side has wholly consumed me, and you will suffer for failing to see that!
21142 := You are brave... and some would say foolish. But you are also right. The dark side has not wholly consumed me. I cannot raise my blade against you.
21143 := I should stay here, though. If we face Malak I am afraid his dark presence will overwhelm me. It would not be wise to expose myself to such temptation.
21144 := Yes, that would be for the best. You don't need me to defeat Malak, anyway. Now I understand that a true Jedi is a match for any Sith. Even the Dark Lord himself.
21145 := I'm sorry, but the risk is too great. I am not wholly free of the dark side's shadow. Not yet. But you are more than a match for the Dark Lord. I understand that now.
21146 := You will go on to defeat Malak, of this I have little doubt. You will have gone from being the Sith Lord, himself, to the savior of our galaxy.
21147 := I... I must know something, first, before that happens. I must ask you something.
21148 := Will there be a place for me in your future? Do you... do you love me?
21149 := I see. Thank you for your honesty. It's probably for the best that it goes no further. You saved me and I will always be grateful.
21150 := You should go. Malak awaits. This isn't over, yet... for any of us.
21151 := And... and you said you loved me. This may not be the best time to say it, but...
21152 := I love you, too. With all my heart.
21153 := After this? No, nothing could make me feel safer than to be loved by you.
21154 := [Failure] There is nothing in my heart but the blackness of the dark side! I am sick of your preaching, Revan!
21155 := [Success] I... I know a flicker of the light still burns within me. Malak felt it too. He knew it could only be extinguished if I killed you.
21156 := But what good is a single flicker of light against the sea of darkness I am drowning in? I can never atone for my betrayal.
21157 := [Failure!] No! That bond is what took me down this path to begin with! It poisoned me... I hated myself for loving you and now I have betrayed everything!
21158 := [Success] You... always had more strength than I did. I told you that. I felt so... helpless before your destiny.
21159 := You were Revan and I couldn't tell you... it was agonizing! Even worse when I began to... feel closer to you. I despised myself for it.
21160 := And even now I... feel your strength. It... does help me. Thank you, I think I can face the end, now. If you are the one to end it for me.
21161 := You are growing weary, I can sense it! Your strength falters, the light side is failing you while the power of the Star Forge re-energizes me! Soon this will all be over!
21162 := What type of trick is this? 
21163 := I am a Sith apprentice now. You place too much faith in what I used to be... and for that you shall pay!
21164 := You dare spew those Jedi lies in my face? You will die screaming, Revan!
21165 := The dark side will always triumph over the light! Malak has assured me of victory! You can't defeat me here on the Star Forge! YOU CAN'T!
21166 := I see now why Malak followed you. Even though you are only a shell of your former self, you are still a formidable opponent.
21167 := I can't even imagine the power you must have wielded when you were the Dark Lord. You were a fool to give it all up and follow the light side.
21168 := Then it's time for you to prove it!
21169 := The dark side has made me stronger than I ever was before! I have a greater command of the Force than all but the most powerful Jedi Masters.
21170 := As Malak teaches me the greatest secrets of the Sith, I will unlock more of my potential. Eventually there will be no limit to what I can accomplish with the Force!
21171 := No, Revan. You are the one who will die here!
21172 := Jedi propaganda. The dark side is only a tool, and Malak will train me in its use. Eventually I will surpass my Master and challenge him. If I am worthy he will die by my hand.
21173 := Have you forgotten the ways of the Sith already, Revan? Eventually I will challenge my Master. If I am worthy he will die by my hand and I will become the new Sith Master.
21174 := Then I will take on my own apprentice and the cycle will begin again. This is the way of the Sith, it is how we assure our leaders are always the strongest and most worthy!
21175 := No, Revan, it is you who are doomed!
21176 := Revan - I knew you'd come for me.
21177 := I have no doubt of that. I was no match for you in the Temple, but when I fled I knew you would follow me here.
21178 := You are wasting your time. I have seen the Jedi for what they are: weak and afraid. The Sith are the true Masters of the Force. You have forgotten that lesson, Revan.
21179 := Sadly, I know this is true. Had you reclaimed the power of your previous identity I would be your apprentice, not Malak's. But you rejected the dark side.
21180 := Now you must pay the price. Here on the Star Forge the power of the dark side is at its strongest. This time you will not defeat me!
21181 := The Republic knocked out the Star Forge generators! This factory is doomed! It's falling from orbit!
21182 := Quickly! we have to get to the Ebon Hawk before this whole complex plunges into the heart of the sun!
21183 := Kill him, Master!!
21184 := The fool is dead. Now there is nothing in the way of your victory!
21185 := You can't win, Bastila. Now you must die!
21186 := I am stronger than you could ever be, Bastila!
21187 := You're right. Don't worry, you won't feel a thing.
21188 := There's no need for me to kill you, Bastila.
21189 := I was the Dark Lord, Bastila, and the Jedi Council let me live.
21190 := You did more than protect me, Bastila.
21191 := [Persuade] I love you, Bastila. I can't abandon you, ever.
21192 := You can't protect someone from the dark side. Each individual must choose their own path.
21193 := You did protect me, Bastila.
21194 := I was redeemed, Bastila. You can be, too.
21195 := You can reject the dark side, Bastila. Return to the light.
21196 := [Persuade] Turn to the Jedi code, Bastila. It can help you.
21197 := Help us defeat the Sith, Bastila. This will atone for what you have done.
21198 := You're right. I suppose I can't trust you, after all.
21199 := I trust you enough to leave myself open to your attack, Bastila.
21200 := You won't, Bastila. I know you still serve the light side.
21201 := You could use your Battle Meditation to aid the Republic fleet.
21202 := Bastila, I want you at my side when I face the Dark Lord.
21203 := No. I'm sorry, Bastila, but I don't love you.
21204 := I love you, Bastila, but after everything that's happened...
21205 := I do love you, Bastila.
21206 := You aren't afraid to love anymore?
21207 := You won't, Bastila. Because I love you and I believe in you.
21208 := [Persuade] Look into your heart, Bastila, and you will find the light.
21209 := [Persuade] Use our bond, then. Take your strength from me.
21210 := I could never kill you, Bastila.
21211 := Now you see the dark side is not stronger than the light.
21212 := Then strike me down, Bastila. I won't defend myself.
21213 := We meant something to each other, once. I don't believe you will strike me down.
21214 := You are not evil, Bastila. You will not strike down a defenseless opponent.
21215 := Remember what you once were, Bastila. A Jedi would never strike down a defenseless opponent.
21216 := You are the one growing weak, Bastila. I hear the desperation in your voice!
21217 := Your emotions get the better of you, Bastila. Remember the Jedi code.
21218 := I have not faltered, Bastila. You have been misled by the dark side.
21219 := I'm still strong enough to defeat you, Bastila!
21220 := You've been consumed by the dark side, Bastila. Can't you see it's destroying you?
21221 := I am as strong in the light as I ever was following the dark side.
21222 := I won't let that happen! I'll kill you first!
21223 := You will accomplish death and destruction with the dark side, nothing else.
21224 := Malak will never let you become that powerful. He will kill you first.
21225 := You're dooming yourself to an endless cycle of death and betrayal.
21226 := You can't escape, Bastila! Wherever you run I'll hunt you down!
21227 := I'll never give up on you, Bastila. I know you can still be saved.
21228 := I'm <FullName> now, Bastila. Revan is no more.
21229 := So you killed Darth Malak. Somehow I... I always knew you would.
21230 := The Republic fleet picked me up from the planet. I told them of your betrayal... but I also told them I couldn't abandon you.
21231 := I had to come. I said I'd find a way to save you from yourself, and I will.
21232 := All you have to do is listen to me. That's all I ask.
21233 := Carth. I knew I sensed your presence. I should have known you would find a way to meddle in this one last time!
21234 := Don't interfere, Bastila. This is between me and Revan.
21235 := You are a fool. Revan has already made her choice, and there is no turning back!
21236 := Don't listen to him, master! Let me strike him down! Seize your victory!!
21237 := I wish... I wish there could have been another way.
21238 := I love you. Even now. Even after... after...after all you have done. I love you like I haven't loved anyone or anything since my wife died. And I didn't even think that was possible.
21239 := You may not love me. You may not love anything anymore now that you've gone over to the dark side... but I believe that there's still some part of you I can reach.
21240 := There's a part of you that believes in hope... and mercy... and love. And that part knows that it will soon be gone forever.
21241 := Your words are meaningless. You have no idea of the power we now wield! Revan will rule the galaxy!!
21242 := I know. It's too late to turn back... but you can end this here. There's still time for one final act of redemption.
21243 := No, it's too late for that. And it's too late for you to turn back... but you can end this here. There's still time for one final act of redemption.
21244 := Kill Bastila. Without her Battle Meditation the Republic fleet can destroy the Star Forge and rid the galaxy of this evil.
21245 := Stay here on the Star Forge. With me. We won't have time to get off before the Star Forge is destroyed, not if you stop Bastila. But our sacrifice can save the Republic.
21246 := If you don't, all you'll have is...is emptiness and darkness. You don't want that. Please don't want that. Stay... let's end this now. Together.
21247 := No! I won't let you do this! Don't be a fool, Revan!!
21248 := No! No-ooo!! You can't do this! Not when we're so close!!
21249 := And abandon you? No, I couldn't have done that.
21250 := I don't believe that. I don't think you do, either.
21251 := There you are! What happened?
21252 := Hey! I was doing what I could, thank you very much!
21253 := No time to celebrate just yet. With Bastila dead, the Republic has broken through the Sith fleet! The capital ships are in bombardment range!
21254 := And that means we have to get out of here right now, before this entire complex comes down around our ears! Everyone else is already on the ship! Let's move!!
21255 := There's no time to celebrate just yet. I was able to use my Battle Meditation to allow the Republic to break through the Sith fleet. The capital ships are in bombardment range!
21256 := I don't think anyone actually expected that he could be redeemed. I'm surprised you would even think of trying.
21257 := I don't think anyone actually expected that he could be redeemed. I'm surprised you would even think of trying.
21258 := That's great news! I knew you could do it!
21259 := That's wonderful news!
21260 := We have to kill her! Her Battle Meditation is the only thing stopping the fleet from getting through!
21261 := It's done. Bastila is dead.
21262 := Soon the Republic fleet will break through and the capital ships will be able to bombard the Star Forge. Then it will finally be over.
21263 := It's the only way. The only alternative is a path I know you don't want to take.
21264 := You're very brave to make the decision you did. I... I love you. You know that, right?
21265 := This is all the time we have. It should all be over soon.
21266 := There isn't much time. It should be over soon.
21267 := You know that can't happen. There's no turning back for you... there's just an ending.
21268 := There's no point. There's no other place I'd rather be than here.
21269 := Carth. You should still be on the planet, shouldn't you?
21270 := And how, exactly, do you propose to do that?
21271 := Yes, kill him. Nothing he could say will matter.
21272 := I don't need you, Carth, and I won't change my mind.
21273 := No, let him speak. I want to hear what he has to say.
21274 := Kill him, Bastila. He means nothing to me.
21275 := It's too late to turn back, Carth. Even if I wanted to.
21276 := It's not too late for you to join me, Carth.
21277 := That will never happen. Bastila... kill him now.
21278 := You're mad!
21279 := And what happens to me?
21280 := I... alright. I'll do it. For you.
21281 := Time for this to end, Bastila!
21282 := You could join us, Bastila. Turn away from the dark side.
21283 := I... am *not* Revan!!
21284 := I think it's time to end this, all right... with your death.
21285 := Don't be stupid. I could never agree to that.
21286 := You should have stayed wherever you ran to.
21287 := It's good you came. I'll enjoy killing you.
21288 := Somehow I'm not surprised you found a way here.
21289 := Carth?! How did you get here?!
21290 := I killed him... and a lot of help you were, by the way.
21291 := There was no way to turn him to the light side. I had to kill him.
21292 := Darth Malak is dead. It's over, finally.
21293 := Are you sure this is the best way?
21294 := I just wish we had more time.
21295 := Thank you, Carth. For everything.
21296 := I love you too.
21297 := We could still leave, Carth, go somewhere...
21298 := You could still save yourself, Carth.
21299 := Are you dark side or light side?
21300 := Are you in love with Carth or not?
21301 := Are you in love with Bastila or not?
21302 := Thank you.
21303 := Light Side
21304 := Dark Side
21305 := Not.
21306 := In love with Carth.
21307 := Not.
21308 := In love with Bastila.
21309 := Well done, Revan. I was certain the defenses of the Star Forge would destroy you, but I see there is more of your old self in you than I expected.
21310 := You are stronger than I thought; stronger than you ever were during your reign as the Dark Lord. I did not think that was possible.
21311 := You are eager for blood, Revan... as am I. Very well, you shall have your wish.
21312 := No, Revan, this time our confrontation can only end in death... yours or mine.
21313 := Once again we shall face each other in single combat... and the victor will decide the fate of the galaxy!
21314 := Once you were stronger than me, Revan. But as your apprentice I surpassed you. The Master must always be stronger than the apprentice... that was why I betrayed you.
21315 := I cannot deny your resilience. You survived my first betrayal, thanks to Bastila's inteference. You escaped the destruction of Taris and you escaped me on the Leviathan.
21316 := You even survived my attempt to destroy you with the Star Forge itself. Fate and destiny have conspired to keep you alive despite all my efforts.
21317 := We have been inexorably pushed to this final confrontation, Revan. I see now that this can only be settled when one of us destroys the other.
21318 := No! I was prepared to face you, Revan. But fate presented me with a better option. I saw my opportunity and seized it.
21319 := The trap set by the Jedi only hastened my decision. If they had not attacked I would have challenged you for mastery of the Sith soon enough.
21320 := I am tempted to try and capture you alive, Revan. Then I could break your will and bind you to me as my apprentice, as I did Bastila.
21321 := You would be a far greater asset to me than even Bastila and her Battle Meditation, if I could control you. But is it worth the risk?
21322 := Perhaps you are too powerful to be my apprentice. I betrayed you when I realized my own strength was greater than yours; in time you might try to do the same to me.
21323 := Foolish words. The darkness and the light wage a constant war within you. The balance is tipped one way now, but it can easily be tipped back.
21324 := Savior, conqueror, hero, villain. You are all things Revan... and yet you are nothing. In the end you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone.
21325 := Of course. What else do you have? Fate and destiny have conspired to keep you alive despite my best efforts; they have thrust you into the role of savior. 
21326 := You continue to amaze me, Revan. If only you had been the one to uncover the true power of the Star Forge you might have become truly invincible.
21327 := But you were a fool. All you saw was an enormous factory, all you ever imagined was an infinite fleet rolling forth to crush the Republic. You were blind, Revan - blind and stupid!
21328 := The Star Forge is more than just a space station. In some ways, it is like a living creature. It hungers. And it can feed on the dark side that is within all of us!
21329 := Look around you, Revan. See the bodies? You should recognize them from the Academy. These are Jedi who fell when I attacked Dantooine. For all intents and purposes dead, except for one difference:
21330 := I have not let them become one with the Force. Instead I have brought them here. The Star Forge corrupts what remains of their power and transfers the dark taint to me!
21331 := You cannot beat me, Revan. Not here on the Star Forge. Not when I can draw upon the power of all these Jedi!
21332 := And once you are beaten I will do the same to you. You will be trapped in a terrible existence between life and death, your power feeding me as I conquer the galaxy!
21333 := Im... [cough] impossible. I... I cannot be beaten. I am the Dark Lord of the Sith.
21334 := Still... [cough] still spouting the wisdom the Jedi, I see. Maybe there is more truth in their code than I ever believed.
21335 := I... I cannot help but wonder, Revan. What would have happened had our positions been reversed? What if fate had decreed I would be captured by the Jedi?
21336 := Could I have returned to the light, as you did? [cough] If you had not led me down the dark path in the first place, what destiny would I have found?
21337 := I suppose... I suppose you speak the truth. I alone must accept responsibility for my fate. I wanted to be Master of the Sith and ruler of the galaxy.
21338 := But that destiny was not mine, Revan. [cough] It might have been yours, perhaps... but never mine. And in the end, as the darkness takes me, I am nothing.
21339 := Yes... I cannot deny it any longer. [cough] You are the one who deserves... who deserves to be the Dark Lord.
21340 := You were the one who found the first Star Map on Dantooine, Revan. [cough] It was you who lead us on our quest for the Star Forge. I only followed in your wake.
21341 := I tried to usurp your rule, to steal the title of Sith Master from you. But now I understand... The destiny is yours, Revan. Not mine.
21342 := You... you are Darth Revan, Lord ... [cough] Lord of the Sith. And I... I am nothing.
21343 := And so it ends as I somehow always knew it must: in darkness.
21344 := I tire of this game, Revan. You have been a thorn in my side from the moment I seized the mantle of Dark Lord from your feeble grasp!
21345 := You made a mistake coming here, Revan. The Star Forge fuels my command of the dark side. You are no match for me here. And this time you will not escape!
21346 := You may have reclaimed your identity, Revan, but you have lost the power you once wielded! You are not the Dark Lord anymore. You are nothing!
21347 := Ha-ha! You are such a fool, Revan! You claim to be a Jedi, yet you feed on anger and hate! But even the power of the dark side cannot save you now!
21348 := You are an insignificant speck beneath my notice. I have surpassed you in every way and accomplished what you never could... I have unleashed the full potential of this Rakatan factory!
21349 := You had no idea of the power within this place! Its very walls are alive with dark side energies! And now, my old master, I will let the Star Forge itself destroy you!
21350 := Is that what you call it? You think stripping away your power and your identity was an act of mercy, Revan? I would rather die!
21351 := Spoken like a true slave of the Jedi code. Save your preaching, Revan - I will have none of it!
21352 := Enough words! Now we end this!
21353 := This is your last chance, Malak. Surrender.
21354 := I was always stronger than you, Malak! That was why I was the Master!
21355 := You underestimated me back then... you still do.
21356 := You betrayed me from afar. You were afraid to face me, Malak.
21357 := I would have killed you then... and I'm going to kill you now!
21358 := You knew I was stronger than you. You still know it.
21359 := The light side is stronger than you know, Malak.
21360 := You're still making the mistake of underestimating me, Malak.
21361 := I will never serve the dark side again, Malak!
21362 := I believe in the power of redemption.
21363 := Is there some point to this?
21364 := What are you talking about?
21365 := [Cool effect where he drains power from a Jedi body]
21366 := The power of the light will always be stronger than the dark side.
21367 := This is the way of the dark side, Malak: all things end in death.
21368 := I am sorry I started you on this path. But you chose to continue down it.
21369 := You cannot blame me for the path you chose.
21370 := The Star Forge is mine now, Malak!
21371 := No, Malak. I am the true Sith Master!
21372 := You should have known you could never defeat me, Malak!
21373 := The apprentice has learned his final lesson.
21374 := I am the true Sith Master! Prepare to die, Malak!
21375 := I am the Dark Lord reborn! Bow down before me, Malak!
21376 := The Sith slaughter ends here, Malak, with your death!
21377 := It's you who can't escape, Malak. Surrender and the Jedi might show you mercy.
21378 := That can be arranged!
21379 := I was saved from the darkness, Malak. You can be too, if you wish.
21380 := What would you like to do?
21381 := Very well.
21382 := [Failure] The generators are not destroyed.
21383 := [Success] The generators are destroyed.
21384 := [Failure] There is no new blaster weapon.
21385 := [Success] The new blaster weapon is created.
21386 := [Failure] The generators will continue as they have been.
21387 := [Success] The different type of explosive has been created.
21388 := [Failure] The generators will continue as they were.
21389 := [Success] The generators will now create only other kinds of droids.
21390 := [Failure] The droids continue to attack.
21391 := [Success] The droids will no longer attack you.
21392 := [Failure] The generators remain on.
21393 := [Success] The generators are off.
21394 := Leave this computer alone.
21395 := Destroy the generators
21396 := Create a new blaster weapon.
21397 := Create a different type of explosive.
21398 := Create a different type of droid.
21399 := Change the programming on the droids so they will no longer attack you.
21400 := Shut off the generators
21401 := We'll deal with these Sith, the rest of you split up! Find Malak! We can't let the Dark Lord escape this time!
21402 := Excellent! The Jedi fools will provide a distraction to the Sith troops while we hunt down Malak!
21403 := Excellent! The Jedi fools will provide a distraction to the Sith troops while we hunt down Malak!
21404 := Death to the Sith! Death to the Jedi! Death to you all! ARRRGGHH!!
21405 := Watch out! There's something wrong with the Wookiee!
21406 := The Wookiee is weak; the strain of Mission's murder was too much for him. His mind has snapped!
21407 := We'll deal with these Sith, the rest of you split up!
21408 := Find Bastila and stop her from using her Battle Meditation against the Republic Fleet!

21478 := Bastila - you're alive! Finally, things are looking up. Now we just need to figure out a way to get off this planet.
21479 := You mean you don't have a plan to get off Taris yet? What have you been doing all this time?
21480 := My attitude? It strikes me that you're the one in sore need of an attitude adjustment. I happen to be in charge of this mission, if you'll recall.
21481 := I see. Now that I'm back in charge of this mission, perhaps we can start doing things properly. Hopefully our escape from Taris will go more smoothly than when you "rescued" me from Brejik.
21482 := I know you're new at this, Bastila, but a leader doesn't berate her troops just because things aren't going as planned. Don't let your ego get in the way of the real issues here.
21483 := That hardly strikes me as an appropriate way of addressing your commander, Carth. I am a member of the Jedi Order and this is my mission. Don't forget that!
21484 := My Battle Meditation ability has helped the Republic many times in this war, and it will serve us well here I am sure.
21485 := Your talents might win us a few battles, but that doesn't make you a good leader! A good leader would at least listen to the advice of those who have seen more combat than she ever will!
21486 := You know, I had my doubts about this mission but I figured the Jedi Council wouldn't put you in charge if you weren't prepared. But here you are, acting like a spoiled child!
21487 := I see. It's true I that don't have much military experience; perhaps I should not be so quick to judge. Very well, Carth: what do you suggest we do? 
21488 := Yes... You're right, of course. I apologize, Carth. This has been a difficult time for me. Of course I'm happy to listen to your advice. What do you suggest we do?
21489 := First off we can't get hung up on who's in charge; we all need to work together if we want to get off this rock. The answer's out there, we just have to find it.
21490 := Well said, Carth. And the sooner we start looking the better; I've already been a prisoner of the Vulkars and I don't plan on being captured by the Sith.
21491 := I think we'll need some help getting off Taris. Maybe if we ask around one of the locals can help us out. We should probably start by asking around in the cantinas.
21492 := I'm getting a little sick of your attitude, Bastila!
21493 := Don't worry. We'll figure something out.
21494 := We were trying to find you, remember?
21495 := Carth! You can't talk to your commanding officer like that!
21496 := He's right. You aren't showing much leadership ability right now, Bastila.
21497 := Both of you settle down! This isn't helping.
21498 := Let's go find a way off this planet.
21499 := Okay, so what now?
21500 := Don't worry. I won't let that happen!
21501 := Good to see you up, instead of thrashing around in your sleep. You must have been having one hell of a nightmare. I was wondering if you were ever going to wake up.
21502 := I'm Carth, one of the Republic soldiers from the Endar Spire. I was with you on the escape pod, do you remember?
21503 := I'm not surprised. You took a serious blow to the head. You're probably having all kinds of strange dreams. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
21504 := Well, you've been slipping in and out of consciousness for a couple of days now, so I imagine you're pretty confused about things. Try not to worry. We're safe... at least for the moment.
21505 := We're in an abandoned apartment on the planet of Taris. You were banged up pretty bad when our escape pod crashed, but luckily I wasn't seriously hurt.
21506 := I was able to drag you away from our crash site in all the confusion, and I stumbled onto this abandoned apartment. By the time the Sith arrived on the scene we were long gone.
21507 := Taris is under Sith control. Their fleet is orbiting the planet, they've declared martial law and they've imposed a planet-wide quarantine. But I've been in worse spots.
21508 := I saw on your service records that you understand a remarkable number of alien languages. That's pretty rare in a raw recruit, but it should come in handy while we're stranded on a foreign world.
21509 := There's no way the Republic will be able to get anyone through the Sith blockade to help us. If we're going to find Bastila and get off this planet, we can't rely on anybody but ourselves.
21510 := That smack to your head did more damage than I thought. Bastila's a Jedi. She was with the strike team that killed Darth Revan, Malak's Sith master.
21511 := Bastila is the key to the whole Republic war effort. The Sith must have found out she was on the Endar Spire and set an ambush for us in this system.
21512 := I believe Bastila was on one of the escape pods that crashed down here on Taris. For the sake of the Republic war effort, we have to try and find her.
21513 := I don't think you understand the situation. We can't hide on this planet forever. Eventually the Sith will find us... and, trust me, you don't want that.
21514 := Getting off this world isn't going to be easy... we'll probably need Bastila's help. Not to mention that without her, the whole Republic war effort is doomed.
21515 := I don't. But Bastila's young, and she has a powerful command of the Force. We survived the crash landing, so I'm willing to bet that she may have, too.
21516 := Besides, what's the alternative? I mean, if she's dead, then no one can stop Malak and his Sith from wiping out the Republic. And I'd rather operate on the assumption that she survived.
21517 := Bastila's going to need our help. Many of Darth Malak's followers have mastered the dark side of the Force, and the Sith have already killed more than their share of Jedi in this war. 
21518 := I doubt anyone's specifically looking for us anymore: we're not that important. But if we're careful we can move about the planet without attracting notice; a luxury Bastila won't have.
21519 := She's going to have half the Sith fleet looking for her. They know how vital she is to the war effort.
21520 := Bastila is no ordinary Jedi. She has a rare gift the Jedi call Battle Meditation. Bastila's power can influence entire armies. 
21521 := Through the Force Bastila can inspire her allies with confidence and make her enemies lose their will to fight. And often, that's all it takes to tip the balance in a battle.
21522 := But there are limits to what she can do. From what I understand of her ability, it requires great concentration and focus to maintain her Battle Meditation.
21523 := The attack on the Endar Spire happened so fast she probably never even had a chance to use her power. I'm guessing she barely got out alive, and now she's trapped here just as we are.
21524 := The whole planet is under quarantine. No ships can land or take-off. So if Bastila's going to escape Taris, she's going to need our help. And we'll probably need hers.
21525 := Don't be a fool! You're not getting off this world without help, and you can't hide here forever. Do you have any idea what will happen when the Sith find you?
21526 := You mean besides a chance to get off this planet before the Sith find you? Do you...do you have any idea what the Sith do to prisoners of war?
21527 := Oh, I get it. Never mind that the Sith will destroy the Republic and ravage the galaxy. You're only in this for the credits. 
21528 := Don't worry. The Republic pays its mercenaries well. You help me find Bastila and they'll make it more than worth your while, I'm sure. Plus, it might be your only chance to get off Taris.
21529 := Good. We need to work together if we're going to survive.
21530 := While you were out I did some scouting around. There are reports of a couple escape pods crashing down into the Undercity. That's probably a good place to start.
21531 := But the Undercity is a dangerous place. We don't want to go in there unprepared. It won't do Bastila any good if we go and get ourselves killed.
21532 := Taris is a pretty big place; luckily I found an old swoop droid to help us get around. I've got him sitting by the apartment door. Do you know how a swoop droid works?
21533 := I've entered all the details on how to use the swoop droid into the electronic journal on your datapad if you want to check them out later.
21534 := Good idea. We can use this abandoned apartment as a base, and we can probably get some equipment and supplies here in the Upper City. Just remember to keep a low profile. 
21535 := I've heard some grim stories about the Dark Jedi interrogation techniques. They say the Force can do terrible things to a mind. It can wipe away your memories and destroy your very identity!
21536 := But I figure if we don't do anything stupid we should be okay. I mean, after all, they're... they're looking for Bastila, not a couple of grunts like us. Alright, soldier, let's move out.
21537 := I'll tell you whatever I can, though I...I don't know how much help it'll be. 
21538 := Taris was once a magnificent planet-wide metropolis of towering skyscrapers. But that was a long time ago.
21539 := The Upper City, where the rich citizens live, is...is still pretty safe. If it wasn't for the Sith occupation and the planet-wide quarantine it might not even be that bad a place to live.
21540 := But farther down things have degenerated. The...the Lower City is nothing but a slum overrun by swoop-bike gangs waging a never-ending war for control. And the Undercity is, well, even worse.
21541 := The lowest level of Taris is a wasteland overrun by rakghouls; mindless, diseased mutants that attack on sight. I've already entered all this info into your data-pad journal.
21542 := Everything I know about Malak is pretty much common knowledge. He escaped the trap that killed Darth Revan, his Sith Master. With Revan's death, Malak became the new Dark Lord.
21543 := It's obvious that Malak's a ruthless tyrant who'll crush anyone who stands in his way... just like Revan was. Experience has shown that the Sith won't stop until the Republic lies in ruins.
21544 := Malak and his Sith don't respect anything except raw, brutal power. It's hard to imagine how someone who used to be a Jedi could become such a monster!
21545 := I hope you're right. But the Republic hasn't been able to stop them so far, even with the support of the Jedi Council. I think Bastila might be the galaxy's last hope.
21546 := How can you say that? The Sith are butchers! Soldiers, civilians - I mean, they don't care who they kill! Even...even children!
21547 := Right now the Republic is the only thing keeping Malak's brutal fist from crushing the entire galaxy... and it won't be long until even the Republic falls to the Sith fleet.
21548 := Malak and Revan were once both part of the Jedi Order, but they were young and headstrong. And against the wishes of the Council they went to battle the Mandalorians on the Outer Rim.
21549 := Something happened out there. Something corrupted them and drew them over to the dark side. Or maybe there was something rotten inside them all along. I don't know.
21550 := They formed an army of ex-Republic soldiers and Jedi who had fallen to the dark side, with Revan at their head... until Revan was killed by Bastila's Jedi strike team.
21551 := But even that didn't slow the Sith down. Malak just stepped in and assumed Revan's role. He took control of the Sith armada and resumed the bloody conquest of the Outer Worlds.
21552 := I understand why you want to know more about me; I...I kinda get the feeling we'll be spending a lot of time together over the next while.
21553 := But this isn't really the best time for long introductions; we should stay focused on the task at hand. There'll be time for that later.
21554 := Swoop droids are autopiloted land speeders. Through remote signals we can have them fly in to pick us up or drop us off at a location in a fraction of the time it would take to walk there.
21555 := The swoop can only operate in large, open locations. It can't take us down into the Undercity or inside a shop, but it could take us to a central location in the Upper or Lower City.
21556 := You can signal the swoop from the map screen of your datapad. It uses the map coordinates to plot its course, so if we haven't explored an area the swoop can't get the data to access it.
21557 := Bastila is no ordinary Jedi. She has a rare gift the Jedi call Battle Meditation. Bastila's power can influence entire armies. 
21558 := Through the Force Bastila can inspire her allies with confidence and make her enemies lose their will to fight. Often, that's all it takes to tip the balance in a battle.
21559 := Of course, there are limits to what she can do. But from what I understand of her ability, it requires great concentration and focus to maintain her Battle Meditation.
21560 := The attack on the Endar Spire happened so fast she never had a chance to use her Battle Meditation. Like us, she barely got out alive. 
21561 := Bastila's going to need our help. Many of Darth Malak's followers can use the dark side of the Force, and the Sith have already killed more than their share of Jedi in this war.
21562 := Nobody will be looking for a couple of common soldiers like us. And if we're careful we can move about the planet without attracting notice; a luxury Bastila won't have.
21563 := She's going to have half the Sith fleet looking for her. They know how important she is to the war effort.
21564 := You don't have to thank me. I've never abandoned anyone on a mission, and I'm not about to start now. Besides, I'm going to need your help. 
21565 := Whoa, hold on. Don't try to get up yet. You were smashed up pretty bad when we crash landed here on Taris.
21566 :=  Don't worry, we should be safe here in this apartment. I gave you something to help you sleep. Just get some rest and let the kolto packs do their job. 
21567 := I had a strange dream. Like a vision or something.
21568 := Where am I? How did I get here?
21569 := Carth, the one on the communicator. I remember.
21570 := So are we just going to wait here for the Republic to rescue us?
21571 := Bastila? She's the one from the Endar Spire, right?
21572 := Why is it so important to find Bastila?
21573 := Forget it! I'm not risking my life to try and save her!
21574 := How do you even know Bastila's still alive?
21575 := If Bastila's a Jedi, she can probably look after herself.
21576 := If Bastila's so great how come the Sith managed to blow up the Endar Spire?
21577 := Battle Meditation? What's that?
21578 := If it means getting off this planet, I guess I can help you find Bastila.
21579 := I think I'll take my chances on my own.
21580 := What's in this for me if I help you out?
21581 := If you want my help you better make it worth my while.
21582 := Okay, you made your point. I'll help you out.
21583 := Any idea where we should start looking for Bastila?
21584 := I'm not interested in that right now.
21585 := Come on. I want to scout this planet out a bit.
21586 := The sooner we start looking for Bastila the sooner we find her. Let's go.
21587 := I want to ask you some questions.
21588 := Can you explain how to use the swoop droid?
21589 := What can you tell me about this planet we're on?
21590 := What do you know about Malak and the Sith?
21591 := The sooner we start looking for Bastila the sooner we find her. Let's go.
21592 := I want to ask you something else.
21593 := Don't worry. We'll find a way to stop the Sith.
21594 := Sounds like Malak and the Sith have the right idea.
21595 := A Jedi? What do you mean?
21596 := I'd like to know some more about you, Carth.
21597 := You better explain it to me.
21598 := How can one person, even a Jedi, be so important?
21599 := If Bastila's a Jedi, she can probably look after herself.
21600 := So what do you suggest we do next?
21601 := I guess I owe you my life. Thanks.
21602 := The Sith?
21603 := You ever seen a swoop bike? I seen them at the races sometimes. They go fast and make lots of noise!
21604 := My Momma says I have to stay out of the Lower City. That's where bad people live.
21605 := Is you one of the Sith? My daddy says the Sith are nothing but bullies. You don't look like a bully.
21606 := You ain't supposed to be here! This ain't your home!
21607 := You're one of them Sith, ain't you? My mommy says I'm not supposed to talk to you.
21608 := You again? Why do you keep bothering me?
21609 := You're back. Did you... did you manage to get Holdan to withdraw the price on my head?
21610 := I guess I have no choice but to stay here and hope Holdan cools down. With that bounty on my head it's too dangerous to go outside.
21611 := Then you're going to learn the same lesson I taught Holdan: I'm not as helpless as I look!
21612 := I have nothing... I barely make enough credits to get by. I can't afford to pay that pig off!
21613 := I can never truly repay you for helping me, but you'll always have my thanks for what you did.
21614 := Who are you? What are you doing in here? You can't just come barging into someone's home!
21615 := You're as bad as that pig Holdan! I'll stay out of your way, but you're wasting your time. I don't have anything worth stealing.
21616 := That's no excuse. You can't just go around barging into people's apartments because you're curious! But at least you're more polite than that pig, Holdan.
21617 := I can't help you there. Since this thing with Holdan I've been scared to leave my apartment. I don't know anything about what's going on in the outside world anymore.
21618 := Just one of Davik's men who can't keep his hands to himself. But all he got for his trouble was a nasty scar from my vibroblade! Too bad I'm the one still paying the price.
21619 := I... I don't want to talk about it. I'm in enough trouble already. Besides, I don't know if I can trust you.
21620 := Okay, I'll tell you... just try and stay calm. The last thing I need is trouble with you and Holdan.
21621 := [Failure] No, I don't think so. I can't afford to trust anybody right now. Please, just leave me alone.
21622 := [Success] Well, I suppose you seem like an alright sort. When I cut Holdan it made him back off, but it also embarrassed him in front of his friends.
21623 := Holdan's a spiteful little Hutt-slug. He went and put out a bounty on my head for what I did! That's why I'm hiding out here.
21624 := Good. I don't much like strangers in my home.
21625 := Goodbye, and good luck. I hope you can talk some sense into Holdan.
21626 := Goodbye. Thank you again for all your help. I don't know what I would have done without you.
21627 := I doubt it. Holdan is one of Davik's men. When you work for the local crime lord the authorities tend to turn a blind eye. I'm afraid this is between me and Holdan now.
21628 := You could try, I guess. He usually hangs out at the cantina in the Lower City. It probably won't do any good. Holdan's used to getting his own way.
21629 := That's one of the fringe benefits of being a goon for Davik. Working for the local crime lord lets you get away with things. Still, I appreciate the offer.
21630 := Wait! Think about what you're doing. If that pig had just kept his hands to himself, I wouldn't have had to give him that scar with my vibroblade.
21631 := He gets drunk and tries to force himself on me, and I get a bounty put on my head for defending myself? Where's the justice in that? Holdan's the one to blame, not me.
21632 := He... he called the bounty off? That's wonderful! I only wish I had something to give you as a reward.
21633 := Wait a minute... I know! I don't have many credits, but there is something I can give you. It's a family heirloom. It's not much, but it's something.
21634 := If I had more I'd gladly give it to you, but this is all I've got. I'm sorry.
21635 := Another Sith patrol? I'm telling you, you're wasting your time here.
21636 := Go ahead and search my apartment again, if you want. You'll find the same thing as last time... nothing.
21637 := No, not yet.
21638 := Actually, I've decided to collect that bounty myself!
21639 := I spoke to Holdan, Dia. He'll remove the bounty on your head if you pay him off.
21640 := I'm just looking for something to steal. Stay out of my way and you won't get hurt.
21641 := I'm sorry. I was just investigating the area.
21642 := I want to ask you some questions.
21643 := Holdan? Who's that?
21644 := What do you mean?
21645 := Tell me what's going on or I'll end all your problems... permanently!
21646 := [Persuade] You can trust me. Maybe I can help.
21647 := I'll be going now.
21648 := I think I'll just collect that bounty on your head!
21649 := Is there anything I can do to help?
21650 := Maybe I could speak to Holdan for you.
21651 := I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Dia!
21652 := I'm not getting involved in this. What you do now is your concern, not mine.
21653 := I don't care about justice. I just want the credits!
21654 := I spoke with Holdan. I convinced him to remove the bounty on your head.
21655 := I save your life and all I get is some family trinket?
21656 := Thank you, Dia. This reward will be fine.
21657 := Keep your reward, Dia. Helping you was thanks enough.
21658 := Oh, hello again. Hope you didn't come to make a complaint about the mess in the building. I keep asking for an assistant, but they expect me to do it all on my own.
21659 := I should get back to work anyway. I'll probably see you around - I'm here most of the time. This building doesn't clean itself, you know.
21660 := Hey, I do the best I can with the equipment I got! You're just like all the rest, complaining about me all the time.
21661 := Don't know how much I can tell you, but seeing as how you're new here I guess I can try and help you out.
21662 := Not much of an issue for me, you know? I ain't never left Taris and I ain't never going to. A lot of other folks is sure riled up about it, but I don't really know much about it.
21663 := I prefer to keep to myself, mostly. But there's plenty of people at the cantina who'll be more than happy to tell you what they think about the Sith and their quarantine.
21664 := Well, the best place to go is probably Kebla Yurt's store. She's right across from the cantina, so you can stop in for a drink if you get thirsty while you're shopping.
21665 := Just keep following the apartment complex ring until you come to the elevator. It'll take you out to the Upper City streets. From there just head south a ways. You can't miss it.
21666 := Decent enough place to live, I guess. Except for the lower levels. That's where the swoop gangs hang out. Just stay in the Upper City and you'll be fine.
21667 := You also might want to check out the cantina. I used to go there when I was younger. Good place to get a drink and find out what's going on in the Upper City.
21668 := I'm Kadir. I'm the janitor here! Geez, I know you're a new tenant and all but I didn't think you'd forget me already! I have feelings, you know!
21669 := Yeah, okay then. No hard feelings. So, what can I do for you?
21670 := Hey, there - watch where you're walking! I just cleaned these floors.
21671 := Oh, I get it! You figure that just because I'm a janitor you don't have to show me any respect. I'm beneath you, is that it?
21672 := Hmph! You'll change your tune the first time your plumbing breaks down and raw sewage floods your apartment. Then you'll be beggin' for Kadir to come help you out!
21673 := We'll see who has the last laugh then! Now if you ain't going to be civil then I got work to do. This place doesn't clean itself, you know!
21674 := There's no need to antagonize the man. Besides... do you want to live in filth? I sure don't.
21675 := Well, alright then. No hard feelings.
21676 := My name's Kadir. I'm the janitor for this building. You must be the new tenant here, right? I never thought they'd rent that abandoned apartment.
21677 := Hmmm.... you look like an off-worlder. What happened, you get stuck here because of the quarantine? Can't see any other reason someone would want to rent that old apartment.
21678 := D...don't hurt me... I'm just the janitor here. I don't know nothing that would be useful to you Sith!
21679 := I'll be going now.
21680 := This place is a dump! You should be fired!
21681 := I want to ask you some questions.
21682 := What do you think of the Sith and this quarantine?
21683 := Where is the cantina?
21684 := Where can I get some equipment?
21685 := I want to ask you something else.
21686 := Tell me about Taris.
21687 := Who are you again?
21688 := I've got more important things to worry about than remembering some janitor!
21689 := Sorry, Kadir. I'm not good with faces.
21690 := I'll walk wherever I want!
21691 := Yeah, that's pretty much it.
21692 := Sorry, I didn't mean any disrespect.
21693 := Sorry, I didn't know.
21694 := Who are you?
21695 := Greetings, master. Please select the destination you wish to travel to. My database contains coordinates for the following locations on Taris:
21696 := As you wish, master.
21697 := I will take you there right away.
21698 := I will take you there right away.
21699 := I will take you there right away.
21700 := I will take you there right away.
21701 := I will take you there right away.
21702 := I will take you there right away.
21703 := I will take you there right away.
21704 := I will take you there right away.
21705 := I will take you there right away.
21706 := Greetings, master. I regret that my database contains no destination coordinates for this planet. I cannot take you anywhere until location data is retrieved.
21707 := I don't want to go anywhere right now.

21780 := Davik doesn't like you missing payments!
21781 := Here - I've got fifty credits! A down payment. That should buy me some time, right?
21782 := Sorry, you're out of time. Now it's all or nothing. Davik can't have people not paying his debts!
21783 := But I don't have that much! How can I give you credits I don't have?
21784 := That's too bad. Davik's going to want to make an example of you! You're coming with us.
21785 := No - help! Somebody help! They're going to kill me!
21786 := Hold on a second. Looks like we got ourselves a witness here!
21787 := Davik doesn't like witnesses.
21788 := Guess we have to teach you to mind your own business!
21789 := Smart move to mind your own business.
21790 := Come on. We don't want to keep Davik waiting - that's only going to make things worse.
21791 := What's the matter, you forget the arrangement? You Sith don't bother us on Davik's business and we don't bother you!
21792 := We take our orders from Davik, not you!
21793 := Leave this man alone or you'll have to deal with me!
21794 := Sorry. I'll be going now.
21795 := It's time for a new arrangement!
21796 := I'm ordering you to leave this man alone.
21797 := Look out! Those bounty hunters will kill you!
21798 := Thank you - I owe you my life! Those bounty hunters were going to take me away and kill me! My wife warned me not to take a loan from Davik. 
21799 := Now I can't pay him back. It's not good to owe a crime lord money. He'll just keep sending more bounty hunters after me until I'm dead! 
21800 := What? You're robbing me? You're no better than those bounty hunters! Here - take my credits! Now I'm getting out of here!
21801 := Are you joking? We don't need this guy's credits. Just go on, we were happy to help.
21802 := I'm getting out of here before any more of Davik's goons show up. You should do the same.
21803 := You already helped me by saving me from those bounty hunters. So unless you have a spare 100 credits to give me so I can pay off Davik, there's nothing else you can do. 
21804 := You're giving me 100 credits? Just like that? I... I don't know what to say! Thank you! Thank you!
21805 := Now I can pay off Davik. You've saved my life! Thank you! I better take these credits to him right away! 
21806 := You're giving him a hundred credits? Generous.
21807 := I guess you Sith aren't all bad... uh, I mean... look, I don't want any trouble. I'll just be going now.
21808 := Hand over all your credits if you want to live!
21809 := I'm just glad I could help.
21810 := Maybe I can help you.
21811 := Here's 100 credits. Take them.
21812 := You ever seen a swoop bike? I seen them at the races sometimes. They go fast and make lots of noise!
21813 := My Momma says I have to stay out of the Lower City. That's where bad people live.
21814 := Is you one of the Sith? My daddy says the Sith are nothing but bullies. You don't look like a bully.
21815 := You ain't supposed to be here! This ain't your home!
21816 := You're one of them Sith, ain't you? My mommy says I'm not supposed to talk to you.
21817 := That new mercenary working for Davik - I heard he's a Mandalorian! I wonder if he fought in the Mandalore Wars?
21818 := Check this out... we've got a real live celebrity here. The Mysterious Stranger mixing with the common folk! 
21819 := I lost a bundle betting against you, Stranger. Next time I'll know better.
21820 := Have you got your tickets for Bendak Starkiller's return to the duel ring? I hear it's going to be an illegal death match!
21821 := I hear the crime lord Davik has a ship that can break through the Sith blockade.
21822 := I hear there's a gang war between the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars raging in the lower city. 
21823 := Hey - didn't you just win the big swoop bike race in the Lower City? Yes, it was you, I'm sure! That race was amazing!
21824 := Too bad Brejik wouldn't pay up on his wager! Oh well - he got what was coming to him. Heh heh.
21825 := I'm just an ordinary citizen minding his own business. Really... you Sith don't have to worry about me.
21826 := What is thish planet coming to, huh? [hic] Shlummies walkin' around the Upper City!
21827 := Shouldn't you go back to the Lower Cities where you belong, shlummie? 
21828 := Yeah, like he said, these shtreets are for the Upper City citizens! You better get out of our way if you know what's good for you!
21829 := Hey, this shlummie's got a mouth!
21830 := Oh, great. We're fighting the drunks, are we? Man, do they stink.
21831 := You talk big, shlummie! Maybe you should show us a little more reshpect!
21832 := [Success] Uh... c'mon, fellas. This shlummie ain't worth the bother. 
21833 := [Failure] We don't drink with your kind, shlummie! Go back to the lower city where you belong!
21834 := Time to teach you a lesson, shlummie! [hic] Maybe you'll think twice about coming up into our turf!
21835 := [Success] A drink? Hey - for a shlummie you ain't so bad! Come on boys - this shlummie's buying the next round!
21836 := No way! Forget it! No more drinksh! We're late enough as it is.
21837 := Uh... yeah. I guess you're right. Maybe next time, shlummie. [hic] Come on fellas, let's go.
21838 := Well, this is rich.
21839 := Woo, hey, look at this... it's the Shith! [hic] Oh no, I'm sho shcared! Hoo hoo hoo.
21840 := Careful... don't do anything shtupid! [hic] We don't want no trouble with the Shith. [hic]
21841 := Uh... yeah. You're right. [hic] Shorry about this, Shithy. [hic] Come on fellas, let's go.
21842 := If you're trying to pick a fight, you've got one!
21843 := [Persuade] You'd better think twice about what you're doing. This might be more than you can handle.
21844 := [Persuade] Hey, guys, we can all be friends here. Let me buy you a drink.
21845 := I'm no alien-lover, but I don't want to see them all killed! This kook's way out of line.
21846 := This guy's just stirring up trouble! Sure, there's a lot of aliens on Taris, but most of them stick to the Lower City.
21847 := This crazy street preacher keeps on about war and days of reckoning and the Sith just might lock him away.
21848 := You Sith should shut this guy up. I think he's violently dangerous. Just listen to him!
21849 := Huh - if he thinks it's bad up here, he should spend some time in the Lower City!
21850 := Gorton's always going on about the 'great plague' spreading over Taris. It gets a little tiring.
21851 := Crazy street preacher! Why don't the Sith shut this guy up?
21852 := I don't know why you Sith allow this guy to preach his violent anti-alien garbage!
21853 := Greetings again, friend. Have you mentioned my Anti-Alien League to others? We must always be looking for those sympathetic to our cause.
21854 := Excellent, excellent! There is much work yet to be done, but spreading our message is the first step!
21855 := It pains me to see that an alien lover such as yourself is still allowed to walk free! I've seen how the Sith operate... I know they will support my anti-alien policies!
21856 := When the day of reckoning comes, you will suffer with the rest of the scum and alien lovers!
21857 := Friends and fellow humans - I bring you a warning! A warning of a great plague spreading across our planet! Please, listen to me!
21858 := My name is Gorton Colu. Will you join my cause? We must band together if we are to stop the spread of vermin and scum throughout Taris!
21859 := Go then - you are no better than the alien-lovers! Turn a blind eye. Ignore what is happening, and one day you will see it is too late!
21860 := I am speaking of the hideous looking aliens who walk the world of Taris! The Wookiees and Ithorians and Rodians and Bith - all of them! Listen, friend, for these are dark times.
21861 := That is why I, Gorton Colu, have formed the Anti-Alien League. The time has come for action! We cannot sit idly by while aliens blight our glorious planet!
21862 := Yes, my fellow human! You have seen the light! Gorton Colu has marked your face - I will remember you when the time to destroy the aliens and the alien-lovers is upon us!
21863 := For now, stay vigilant. Be ready. Trust no one. I will find you when the day of reckoning is upon us, and together we will rid beautiful Taris of these alien species!
21864 := That's not exactly humorous. You are encouraging his hatred and blindness.
21865 := Hmph! You may think it's okay to joke about killing aliens to string Gorton along, but I don't think that kind of thing is funny at all!
21866 := Remain true to the cause, friend. Enlightened humans such as yourself are few and far between - but we shall triumph when the day of reckoning comes!
21867 := What a rail-slug! Give Big Z five minutes alone with that guy and he'd straighten him out... or maybe twist him like a Tarisian Zella nut.
21868 := You are like all the rest! You will not see the truth! On the day of reckoning you will suffer with the rest of the alien lovers!
21869 := We should leave. This man may be deranged, but he could also make considerable trouble for us.
21870 := Come on. We should keep moving. Kook or no, people like him can make trouble for us.
21871 := Hear that, laser brain? Sell it somewhere else, 'cause we ain't buying!
21872 := How dare you speak to me while you travel in the presence of alien Wookiee scum! You have violated one of this great planet's oldest and most revered laws!
21873 := You have brought aliens to the Upper City! They are a blight upon Taris - they take our jobs and our homes, and spread their filth throughout our world.
21874 := How dare you brazenly parade about the Upper City with such alien scum at your side! I, Gorton Colu, founder of the Anti-Alien League, will not stand for this!
21875 := I see you share the opinions of many on this world: that aliens are useful as servants and slaves. But I am here to tell you this is not so! Aliens deserve only death!
21876 := Do we have to stand here and listen to this space-slug? He's starting to get on my nerves, you know?
21877 := Silence, alien scum! The presence of your kind is tolerated here on Taris, but a change is coming!
21878 := No more filth than you're spreading, crazy man.
21879 := Yeah! You tell him, Big Z!
21880 := This beast just growled at me! It is a savage creature that will hurt someone!!
21881 := Greetings, my Sith friends. Rest assured, I have all the proper permits to be here spreading my message. 
21882 := Feel free to stay and listen if you wish. You'll find my message most enlightening.
21883 := A plague spreads through our streets! We cannot sit idly by while this pox infects our society!
21884 := The evil walks among us! The enemy is here! We must act now before we are overrun with the vermin invaders!
21885 := Listen to me, people! There is a terrible scourge sweeping our planet! Heed my warning, before it is too late!
21886 := Uh... yes. I mention it to everyone I meet.
21887 := Uh... I haven't mentioned it yet, but I will. Don't worry.
21888 := Get away from me, you bigot!
21889 := I'll be going now.
21890 := Are you refering to the Sith?
21891 := You're right! We should slaughter the whole bunch of them!
21892 := I see... well, good luck in your crusade.
21893 := Back off, you crazy kook. I don't have time for this.
21894 := I don't know which is worse - your hate mongering or your ignorance.
21895 := Vermin and scum? What are you talking about?
21896 := Don't worry - this Wookiee is just my servant.
21897 := I keep whatever company I want!
21898 := Please, human - I am injured and in need of assistance. These human children keep hitting and kicking me. I cannot reason with them, but if I fight back I could be arrested.
21899 := Get out of here you goggle-eyed freak! You're too ugly for the Upper City!
21900 := Yeah - go back where you came from! We don't want your kind up here!
21901 := Unh! Please - human! Help me! Maybe these offspring of your species will listen to you.
21902 := Why do you care what happens to some scummy alien? He's just a freak!
21903 := Yeah - he isn't even supposed to be in the Upper City!
21904 := Ahh!! Run for it!
21905 := Come on - let's go. I don't want to listen to this alien lover anymore!
21906 := Thank you, human. I was returning from a visit with a work associate when those child humans attacked me and chased me through the streets.
21907 := I am sorry, human. I wish I had a reward to give you to show my appreciation for your intervention, but I have no suitable reward on my person. 
21908 := You are too kind, human. I thank you for your generosity. Most of your kind here on Taris care little for aliens like myself.
21909 := Once more, thank you for saving me from those human children. I must take leave of you now. My life mate will be wondering where I am.
21910 := Among my people many believe all the Sith are cruel and heartless, but I see now that is not true.
21911 := Well, I will. You kids... get lost before I kick your sorry butts! Now, now beat it!!
21912 := Well I will. You children get away... just because he is different does not give you the right to attack him!
21913 := Yeah - why would a human want to help you, freak?
21914 := Take that you alien scum!
21915 := Wow! You got him good that time! Hey - I think he's dead!
21916 := Let's get out of here!
21917 := Hey, aren't you...? Hey, hey stop that, you kids! Leave him alone!
21918 := I will not stand here and let that poor man be stoned! You there, children... leave him alone!
21919 := Hey! You aren't going to just let them keep hurting him, are ya?
21920 := You're a freak, too! Why don't you get outta here, ya freaks!!
21921 := You want me to come over their and kick your little butts?! That's it... now you're in for it!!
21922 := Away with you children! RRAWWWWRR!!
21923 := Hey - you kids! Leave that Ithorian alone!
21924 := Get out of here you punks or you'll be the ones in pain!
21925 := Just because he's different doesn't give you the right to attack him!
21926 := Do you have any kind of reward for me helping you?
21927 := You look hurt. Here, I've got a medpac. Let me help you.
21928 := You should be okay now. I'm glad I could help.
21929 := Fine - I don't want to get involved.
21930 := Sorry - I don't want to get involved!
21931 := Back again, I see. Well, I've never turned a potential customer away yet. You interested in seeing what I have in stock?
21932 := Welcome back to my shop. If you want to buy something I'd suggest you do it soon, before the Sith haul me off to their interrogation chambers.
21933 := Somebody broke into the military base. The Sith are convinced one of my utility droids was used during the break-in. They were here questioning me just a little while ago.
21934 := I guess they believed me when I said I didn't know anything about it, but I get the feeling they might be back. So get your shopping in while you can. 
21935 := I heard Bendak Starkiller finally met his match. I can't say I'm surprised - he was getting on in years. People start to lose their edge as they get older.
21936 := That's the nice thing about droids. A yearly maintenance check and a few replacement parts here and there and they can last forever.
21937 := Have you heard the news? Bendak Starkiller is coming out of retirement to fight in a death match. Everybody's trying to get tickets to see it.
21938 := I've never understood why people always want to watch each other get killed. Droids don't think that way. Maybe that's why I like them better than people.
21939 := A customer? Come in, come in. Janice Nall at your service. Welcome to my droid and droid supply shop.
21940 := Always good to see a new face - customers are hard to come by. A lot of the Taris citizens won't even come in here; they refuse to shop at a store owned by a Twi'lek.
21941 := My selection is a bit limited right now - the Sith confiscated all my assault droids. But I've got a utility droid you might find interesting.
21942 := Maybe I'll see you around later. Don't forget my store motto: if you need droid parts, Janice Nall is your gal!
21943 := I don't know if I can help you with your questions - I don't get out much. I prefer spending time with my droids to mingling with the Taris citizens. But I'll try to help you out.
21944 := Well, I don't know exactly what to tell you. Stick to the Upper City and you should be okay, as long as you don't do anything foolish to draw the attention of the Sith.
21945 := Some of the Upper City citizens are biased against aliens - makes it tough for me to run my store - but a human like you shouldn't run into any problems.
21946 := I wouldn't recommend going down into the Lower City unless you have business with Davik or something like that. The place is overrun with swoop gangs.


21947 := Davik Kang's a dangerous man. If it's illegal on Taris, he's got a hand in it. And I heard he's a member of the Exchange - you know, the intergalactic crime syndicate.
21948 := I'd stay out of Davik's business if I were you. If you cross Davik you'll learn that his men are even more dangerous than the swoop gangs.
21949 := They're nothing but a bunch of thugs! Things didn't used to be so bad when the Hidden Beks were in charge - I even sold some droids to them.
21950 := But now the Black Vulkar gang is making a bid for control of the Lower City. The place has become a war zone. Even some of Davik's people are getting killed off.
21951 := I don't think much of them since they came and seized most of my droids. I guess they were afraid of someone using my droids against them.
21952 := Or maybe they wanted to use my droids for themselves. There's no such a thing as a bad droid, but sometimes they fall in with bad owners.
21953 := People are saying a few of the pods crashed down in the Undercity. I blame it on human error - a droid wouldn't lose control of the ship like that. Anything else? 
21954 := My inventory is a bit limited because of the quarantine, but if you need anything to do with droids or computers this is still the place to shop.
21955 := You want to see my inventory, or are you here to buy a utility droid? My prices are very reasonable, and all my droids come with a money back guarantee.
21956 := I've only got two droids left: a re-built T3-H8 unit for 50 credits and a top of the line T3-M4 model with all the options. But he's not for sale. 
21957 := The T3-M4 is the best utility droid ever built: top notch codebreaker; expert security, programming and droid repair skills. He's even got the firepower to be handy in battle.
21958 := You know a bargain when you see one. This little guy's as reliable as used droids get. I did the reconditioning on him myself! Don't worry... he'll follow you everywhere!
21959 := Is there anything else you need?
21960 := All I've got left is this T3-M4 unit. Excellent codebreaker. Fantastic security, programming and droid repair skills. A good amount of firepower, too.
21961 := Oh, Canderous sent you! Well why didn't you say so? Okay, the droid is ready. You can have it for 2000 credits.
21962 := Okay, that's your decision I guess. Seems to me Canderous wouldn't have sent you if he didn't want you to buy it, though.
21963 := You're joking, right? You mean to tell me Canderous sent you to collect this droid for Davik and you can't pay? I find that hard to believe. But it's not my problem, is it? So... are you going to pay?
21964 := So, is there anything else I can do for you?
21965 := [Failure] Half? Are you kidding? This is *the* best droid you'll ever buy! The price is non-negotiable, even for one of Davik's agents. The price is firm - 2000 credits, take it or leave it.
21966 := [Success] Half? If you're trying to rob me why not just stick a blaster in my face? On the other hand, I do want to stay on Davik's good side. Tell you what, he's yours for 1500.
21967 := Wow... look at you, big spender! Okay, the T3-M4 unit is yours. Pleasure doing business with you. A real pleasure.
21968 := What don't they do? They're great at making vehicle repairs, for starters. Pretty handy to have in a fight - small, but tough with a surprising amount of firepower.
21969 := And there's no better code breaker or security system slicer around... not that I'd ever condone you doing anything illegal, of course.
21970 := They don't like aliens much here in Upper Taris. They tolerate us Twi'leks, but they'd rather see us as dancers in the cantina than successful business owners.
21971 := You'll see a few aliens around, but most of the non-humans stick to the Lower City. I've learned not to dwell on it, though. I try to stay focused on running my store.
21972 := Welcome back to my shop. Hey - where's that little T3-H8 unit I sold you?
21973 := Now just settle down. There's no need to get upset - I run an honest business here.
21974 := It blew up? Huh, I thought I'd taken care of that little cross-wiring problem. Well, don't worry - I run an honest business here.
21975 := I don't have to give you a refund, but I don't want to lose a customer. Here... have your 50 credits back. No hard feelings, right?
21976 := [Failure] What? I offer you a full refund and you want more? Business is tough enough as it is... you should be glad I'm giving you a refund at all!
21977 := [Failure] You're not the first person to try and bully me just because I'm an alien. My loyal customers won't be scared off by the likes of you, so spare me your threats. 
21978 := I guess I have to teach you a lesson: Janice Nall can't be pushed around! So I'll just keep your 50 credits and say buyer beware... and there's nothing you can do about it.
21979 := You're welcome to come back whenever you decide you can be civil and reasonable. Until then, good day.
21980 := [Success] No! Don't do that. I... I can't afford that kind of hit to my business. We can reach some kind of compromise here.
21981 := Glad to hear you're being reasonable. You have to understand that I'm trying to run a business here. Now, is there anything else you need?
21982 := [Success] Well... I guess I did cause you some inconvenience. And I don't want to get a reputation for poor customer service... business is tough enough as it is.
21983 := Here's 75 credits... I think that's more than fair. Now, is there anything else I can do for you? 
21984 := Glad to hear it. I can't afford to make my customers unhappy... business is tough enough as it is. So, anything else you need?
21985 := Oh... hello. Uh... welcome to my shop. Of course the Sith are always welcome here. Would you like to see my inventory?
21986 := Oh... alright then. Goodbye. Please... please do come again. I... I mean it. Really. I've got nothing against you Sith.
21987 := Questions? But... I don't know anything. If I did, I'd tell you right away. I've got no secrets from the Sith.
21988 := Of course. Right away, your Sithness.
21989 := What are you talking about?
21990 := I'd like to see what you have in stock.
21991 := I'll be going now.
21992 := I want to ask you some questions.
21993 := I need some general information on Taris.
21994 := I want to ask you more some more questions.
21995 := What do you know about Davik?
21996 := Swoop gangs? What can you tell me about them?
21997 := I was wondering how you feel about the Sith?
21998 := Do you know anything about those escape pods that crashed here on Taris?
21999 := Let me see what you've got for sale.
22000 := Let me see your inventory.
22001 := Let me see your droids.
22002 := Tell me about that top of the line T3-M4 droid.
22003 := I'll take the T3-H8 unit. Here's 50 credits.
22004 := I'll pass.
22005 := I can't afford that.
22006 := [Persuade] That price is outrageous! I'll give you half. 
22007 := It's a deal.
22008 := Here you go.
22009 := Utility droids? What do they do?
22010 := What do they have against Twi'leks?
22011 := That thing was a piece of junk! You ripped me off!
22012 := It blew up. I came to get my money back.
22013 := [Persuade] I think you should give me something extra for all the trouble.
22014 := [Persuade] Maybe I'll just start telling people not to shop here. You'll be ruined!
22015 := Fine... just give me the 50 credits.
22016 := No hard feelings.
22017 := I'll be going now.
22018 := I want to ask you some questions.
22019 := Let me see what you have for sale.
22020 := I heard the Sith sent a bunch of patrols into the Undercity. Probably want to loot the crash sites of those Republic escape pods that went down there. 
22021 := You heard the latest rumor? Bendak Starkiller is coming out of retirement for one last illegal death match! 
22022 := I can't believe anyone is stupid enough to fight him, but there's no way I'm missing this!
22023 := Hey, I know you - you're the Mysterious Stranger! I saw you beat Bendak in the dueling ring! I lost a bundle betting against you!
22024 := I learned my lesson - next time I'll wager my credits on you. If there is a next time. I doubt anyone will be stupid enough to step into the ring with you now. 
22025 := Have you gone into the music room in the back? I don't care much for the band, but those dancing Twi'leks are something else!
22026 := You like Pazaak? I used to watch it all the time when Gelrood was playing here. He had some great matches against Niklos.
22027 := But then they caught him cheating, and now he's been banned from the Cantina. I haven't followed the game much since then.
22028 := Have you heard the reports? They're saying someone broke into the military compound! The Sith aren't going to like that.
22029 := I hope they don't crack down too hard on us. Things are tough enough as it is.
22030 := The Lower City is nothing but a slum! If the Sith want to win us Tarisians over they should clean the gangs out of there!
22031 := Hey - I saw you win the big swoop race! Too bad Brejik had to get greedy and ruin everything! 
22032 := When that fight broke out I just ran for my life. I never even got a chance to cash in my betting slips!
22033 := I'm not looking for any trouble with the Sith. Please, just let me be.
22034 := Look at Niklos sitting over there with his Pazaak deck. I used to play, you know. But I wasn't very good. I finally sold my deck and gave it up. 
22035 := Bendak Starkiller is coming out of retirement! Everyone's talking about it! Some street-slime fool agreed to fight him in an illegal death match! I wonder how I can get a ticket?
22036 := You... you're the one who killed Bendak Starkiller, aren't you? What a match - best deul I ever saw! You know, you might want to lay low for a while.
22037 := Death matches are illegal; the Sith could arrest you if they ever found out about it. Of course, I think I saw several of the Sith officers at the match, so maybe they don't care.
22038 := The Sith are hunting for any Republic soldiers who escaped the battle overhead. They even sent a patrol into the Undercity to look for survivors!
22039 := I'm surprised the Sith haven't done anything to try and bring in Davik. After all, everyone knows he's the crime lord who runs this planet.
22040 := Maybe Davik and the Sith are working together. Crime lord and the military oppressors - seems like a perfect match, if you ask me.
22041 := People are saying someone broke into the military base. Could mean trouble for us all if the Sith decide a Tarisian citizen was involved.
22042 := Still, I can't say I'm upset about it. It's about time somebody on this world stood up to those Sith!
22043 := There's too many people in this cantina since they added the music room at the back! I come here to relax, not to fight with crowds.
22044 := Did you hear about the big fight at the swoop races? I wasn't there, but someone told me Brejik flipped out on the podium and wouldn't pay up!
22045 := All hell broke loose, and from what I hear Brejik was killed. Serves him right for welching on his bets!
22046 := What... well, what do you want? I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just standing here... please, don't take me in for questioning!
22047 := My "protection" costs have doubled in the last week. Ever since that Mandalorian started working for the Exchange, Davik's been cracking down on all his Underworld operations.
22048 := You beat Bendak Starkiller! Nobody's ever beaten Bendak! Ah, I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes! 
22049 := You just better hope the Sith don't get word of what you were doing. Death matches are illegal, you know.
22050 := Have you got your tickets for Bendak Starkiller's return to the duel ring? I hear it's going to be an illegal death match!
22051 := Huh... if the Sith cared anything about us, they'd stop that gang war in the Lower City.
22052 := I'm in the wrong business... Davik's got a piece of everyone's action. I should have been a crime lord, too! Ha-ha!
22053 := The Sith wouldn't be so bad if they'd let us leave the planet. This quarantine is killing my business!
22054 := I hear there's a gang war between the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars raging in the lower city. 
22055 := Please... don't hurt me! I'm just a simple merchant. I... I don't want anything to do with you Sith. Please, just leave me alone.
22056 := Greetings and good day. On behalf of the new Sith rulers I am programmed to encourage you to enjoy your stay on Taris.
22057 := I am a protocol droid programmed to provide information to everyone on Taris - citizens and visitors alike. Is there something I can do to serve you?
22058 := Then if you will excuse me, I must continue my appointed rounds.
22059 := I am an employee of the Taris government, programmed to provide information and guidance to any who require it.
22060 := Alien species have restricted access to the Upper City. This is one of the most ancient traditions of Taris, and the Sith have promised to preserve such traditions.
22061 := Of course, I have yet to see them arrest a single alien for traveling the Upper City without a permit.
22062 := The Taris Tourism Board has issued a strong warning to all visitors to avoid the Lower City. It is a violent and dangerous place you would do well to avoid.
22063 := I am afraid that is impossible. Taris is currently under a planet wide quarantine. The Sith are allowing no one to arrive or leave, except on official Sith business. 
22064 := The Sith are the new authority here on Taris. They seek to preserve the customs of our world, or so I am told. More than this I cannot say.
22065 := May I be of any further service to you?
22066 := Greetings and good day. I hope your patrolling goes well today. All hail the Sith.
22067 := I don't need anything right now.
22068 := Who do you work for?
22069 := How come there are hardly any aliens around?
22070 := Do you know anything about the gangs in the Lower City?
22071 := Is there some way I can get a shuttle off this planet?
22072 := What can you tell me about the Sith?
22073 := [This security door is sealed and cannot be opened using normal security skills.]
22074 := Look, you've already shown me your authorization so you can go on down to the Lower City anytime you want. You don't have to keep bothering me.
22075 := Just be careful down there. Those swoop gangs will take a shot at anybody. Even our Sith patrols have come under fire!
22076 := This elevator is off limits. Only Sith patrols and those with proper authorization are allowed into the Lower City.
22077 := It's obvious from the way you're dressed that you're not one of the Sith patrols, so unless you have the authorization papers you must move along!
22078 := Move along then.
22079 := I'm not here to give you information! I work for the Sith, not the Taris tourist board! Now just move along, unless you have the proper authorization papers.
22080 := If you were supposed to have them you'd know where to get them. Now quit wasting my time and move along.
22081 := Well why didn't you say so? Hmmm... everything seems to be in order. Okay, I guess you can go down to the Lower City.
22082 := Another patrol heading down to the Lower City, eh? Good luck... I've heard it's pretty rough down there. There's a big swoop gang war going on, you know.
22083 := You better watch yourself: those gangs will take a shot at anyone - even us! It's too bad we don't have the manpower to just sweep those slums clean.
22084 := I'll be going now.
22085 := Can I ask you some questions?
22086 := Where can I get authorization papers?
22087 := I've got my authorization papers right here.
22088 := Out of our way, citizen - we're on official Sith business! Just stand aside if you know what's good for you!
22089 := Is there anything more boring than being out on patrol? Ah, I guess I shouldn't complain.
22090 := Some of the troops got stuck patrolling the Undercity sewers. That's one assignment I wouldn't want!

22203 := My Momma says I have to stay out of the Lower City. That's where bad people live.
22204 := Is you one of the Sith? My daddy says the Sith are nothing but bullies. You don't look like a bully.
22205 := You ain't supposed to be here! This ain't your home!
22206 := You're one of them Sith, ain't you? My mommy says I'm not supposed to talk to you.
22207 := Where did you get those clothes - a trash compactor in the Lower City? And where are those drinks we ordered? 
22208 := Why is the help here so incompetent? One word from Daddy and I could get you fired! 
22209 := How dare you speak to me like that! Daddy's going to hear about this!
22210 := [Failure] It's too late for apologies! Daddy's going to hear about this! You'll lose your job for sure! 
22211 := [Success] That's better! Now hurry up with our order!
22212 := Here are your drinks, Miss Lavin. I apologize for the delay.
22213 := Help! Daddy!
22214 := You need a lesson on how to treat your social betters. Maybe you'll think twice before mocking me next time!
22215 := Don't bother me... I don't speak to the help.
22216 := Order? I have no clue what you're talking about.
22217 := Shut up, you spoiled brat!
22218 := I don't even work here! 
22219 := [Persuade] I'm sorry, don't get upset. I'll go get that drink. 
22220 := Who are you and why are you bossing me around?
22221 := Sorry, I'm not your waiter. 
22222 := Can't you see I'm busy with my duties? Go talk to Zelka if you need something.
22223 := Psst. You there! Wait a minute. I need to talk to you about the rakghoul serum. I've got an offer for you you might want to hear.
22224 := Oh, don't be an idiot. Just listen to me for one minute and you won't be sorry. Davik Kang wants the cure, and you'd be smart to give it to him.
22225 := Zelka isn't the only one who wants to get his hands on the rakghoul serum. Davik Kang will pay you ten times what Zelka can if you can get the cure.
22226 := Helping people is all well and good, but you have to help yourself first, right? I'm telling you Davik will pay big credits for the cure. More than Zelka could ever afford.
22227 := If you find the rakghoul serum, just take it to Zax in the Lower City bounty office. He works for Davik. He'll pay you what that cure is really worth!
22228 := And then only the wealthiest patrons could acquire the cure. That is hardly fair.
22229 := Hey, heh, who said anything about fair?
22230 := If you haven't noticed, not much about this place is fair.
22231 := That doesn't mean we have to actively work to make it worse, Carth.
22232 := We're not in a position to be much more than just realists, are we?
22233 := I am a Jedi. I will always try to help, if I can.
22234 := Look, Zelka can't afford to pay me much. If you sell the serum to Davik, I can probably get a nice finder's fee for directing you to him.
22235 := Hmph. I'll just deny it. Who's Zelka going to believe - me, or some off-world stranger? Now, be smart about this. You'll get a better deal selling to Davik.
22236 := Davik isn't the kind of guy you can just walk up to, you know? He likes to keep his business at arm's length.
22237 := The best thing to do is take the rakghoul serum to Zax. He runs the Lower City bounty office, but everyone knows he also works for Davik. He'll make it worth your while.
22238 := Davik's interested in anything that can turn a profit. He could make a fortune selling the serum to anyone infected with the disease - not like Zelka, who'll practically give it away.
22239 := Oh, come on - everybody knows who Davik Kang is! He's the big boss around here. Gambling, smuggling, extortion - he's got a piece of all the action on Taris.
22240 := I prefer to think of him as a role model. He started with nothing, and now he's got it all: credits, power, women. It's the Tarisian dream, right?
22241 := Remember - if you get your hands on that rakghoul serum take it to Zax in the Lower City bounty office. He works for Davik, and he'll make it worth your while.
22242 := I'm glad you took that serum down to Zax - I got a nice little finder's fee for helping Davik get his hands on the rakghoul cure. He gave me more than Zelka pays in a month!
22243 := Maybe if Zelka charged a little more for his services he could pay me what I'm worth - and maybe this place wouldn't be struggling so hard to stay in business.
22244 := You blew it! If you had brought that rakghoul serum to Zax he would have made it worth your while. But no - you had to go and do the honorable thing!
22245 := Now Zelka's mass-producing the serum and it's all but worthless. You cost me one hell of a finder's fee! You're as bad as Zelka - helping people when there's no profit in it!
22246 := Don't worry, if I hear anything you Sith will be the first to know... for a price of course.
22247 := I'm not interested.
22248 := An offer? What are you talking about?
22249 := I think I'd rather give the serum to Zelka. He'll use it to help people.
22250 := Why do you care who gets the cure?
22251 := What if I tell Zelka you're helping Davik get the cure?
22252 := I'll keep your offer in mind.
22253 := Where can I find Davik if I want to give him the cure?
22254 := Why does Davik want the cure so badly?
22255 := Davik Kang? Who's that?
22256 := You mean Davik's a crime lord?
22257 := Welcome to the Equipment Emporium - finest selection of supplies in all of Taris. You interested in seeing what I have in stock? 
22258 := Hello, again. If you're interested in buying any of my equipment I'd suggest you do it now, because you might not get a chance later on.
22259 := Word on the street is somebody broke into the military compound. I bet they start closing down every business in Upper Taris until they find the culprit.
22260 := But until they shut me down I'm still open for business. So what do you say - you want to see what I have in stock?
22261 := Hey, look at this - a real live celebrity right here in my shop! Winning that swoop bike race has made you into something of a local hero. 
22262 := Hey, look who's back - the Mysterious Stranger! You know, I had a front row seat when you gunned down Bendak Starkiller. Best duel I've ever seen!
22263 := If times weren't so tough I'd give you a discount, seeing as how you're a big celebrity and all. But with the Sith occupation I can barely afford to keep the doors open. 
22264 := Hey, I know you! You're the Mysterious Stranger, right? Everybody's saying you're going to fight Bendak Starkiller in an illegal death match!
22265 := You know Bendak's never lost a match in his life, right? You need to take a look at my weapons and armor.
22266 := Hello there. I haven't seen you in my shop before... allow me to introduce myself. My name is Kebla Yurt. Welcome to the Equipment Emporium.
22267 := You looking to buy some supplies? My shop's the largest one in all of Upper Taris. Best selection on the planet. Whatever you need, I've got. Well, mostly.
22268 := The Sith confiscated all my heavy weapons. And they impounded all my ships and swoop bikes. But I've still got a real nice selection, if you're interested. 
22269 := Good day to you then. Remember to come on back to my shop if you ever need any supplies.
22270 := Oh well, see you around, then. Unless Bendak takes care of you first. Uh, good luck with that, by the way.
22271 := Anything I can do to help a potential customer out. What do you want to know?
22272 := Oh, you're one of those off-worlders, arent you? Come to Taris for a short business trip and end up stuck here because of the Sith quarantine, right?
22273 := Oh, you can't be too happy, trapped on an unfamiliar world and all. But Taris isn't so bad, as long as you stay in the Upper City. Just try to avoid the Sith.
22274 := And stay out of the Lower City. The swoop gangs are totally out of control. Even Davik's men are having trouble down there. 
22275 := Oh, Davik's a legitimate businessman, if you get my drift: smuggling, slaving, extortion. Uh huh. They say he's a member of the Exchange - you know, the big intergalactic criminal organization.
22276 := I have to pay him a protection fee every month, but it's reasonable. And I get most of my inventory through Davik and his suppliers - I'm just smart enough not to ask where it came from, you understand?
22277 := Davik hates the Sith as much as anybody - the quarantine has put a real dent in his operations too. But he's keeping a low profile as long as the occupation lasts.
22278 := Davik stays out of the way, and the Sith don't bother him. The swoop gangs could learn a thing or two from this tidy little arrangement, instead of always going after each other.
22279 := Careful where you say that. Davik's got spies and agents everywhere. Besides, he's as much a part of Taris as the skyscrapers or the swoop gangs.
22280 := Hmm. I've heard of the Exchange. Bad organization to cross. If anyone has blockade-breaking ships, however, it's them.
22281 := I don't have anything good to say about the swoop gangs: zooming around on their swoop bikes, terrorizing the Lower City like a bunch of animals!
22282 := Things weren't so bad when the Hidden Beks were running the show, but ever since the rise of the Black Vulkar gang the Lower City has been nothing short of a war zone!
22283 := The Sith haven't even bothered trying to maintain order down there, and I heard a rumor that Davik's own people are having problems with the Black Vulkars now.
22284 := Uh, heh. It's not smart to say bad things about the people in power, if you get my meaning. I just wish the Sith would ease up on the quarantine - they're killing my business!
22285 := I can't say I like having them here in the Upper City, but it could be worse. And we're still a lot better off than the Lower City, what with those swoop gangs and all.
22286 := I heard a couple of pods crashed down in the Undercity. I bet the crash sites have already been stripped clean by the Sith though - unless the swoop gangs or Davik's men got there first.
22287 := Because of the Sith quarantine I haven't been able to stock any new inventory, but I've still got some nice items you might be interested in.
22288 := Ah, just so you know, the prices on the items are final - no bargaining here. This isn't a swap meet, ok? I only deal in top notch stuff.
22289 := Oh... hello there. Uh... what can I do for you? Would you like to see my inventory? That is why you're here isn't it? At least, I hope so.
22290 := Oh, good. I mean, goodbye. Please come back whenever... uh... whenever you want, I guess.
22291 := Questions? Oh, I... I don't know anything. Nothing you Sith would find interesting, anyway. I'm just a simple shopkeeper.
22292 := Of course, of course. Right away.
22293 := What are you talking about?
22294 := I'll be going now.
22295 := I want to ask you some questions.
22296 := I need some general information on Taris.
22297 := What do you know about Davik?
22298 := Is Davik working with the Sith?
22299 := Davik's nothing but a petty crime lord!
22300 := Swoop gangs? What can you tell me about them?
22301 := I was wondering how you feel about the Sith?
22302 := Do you know anything about those escape pods that crashed here on Taris?
22303 := Let me see what you've got for sale.
22304 := I'll be going now.
22305 := I want to ask you some questions.
22306 := Let me see your inventory.
22307 := Greetings and good day. On behalf of the new Sith rulers I am programmed to encourage you to enjoy your stay on Taris.
22308 := I am a protocol droid programmed to provide information to everyone on Taris - citizens and visitors alike. Is there something I can do to serve you?
22309 := Then if you will excuse me, I must continue my appointed rounds.
22310 := I am an employee of the Taris government, programmed to provide information and guidance to any who require it.
22311 := Alien species have restricted access to the Upper City. This is one of the most ancient traditions of Taris, and the Sith have promised to preserve such traditions.
22312 := Of course, I have yet to see them arrest a single alien for traveling the Upper City without a permit.
22313 := The Taris Tourism Board has issued a strong warning to all visitors to avoid the Lower City. It is a violent and dangerous place you would do well to avoid.
22314 := I am afraid that is impossible. Taris is currently under a planet wide quarantine. The Sith are allowing no one to arrive or leave, except on official Sith business. 
22315 := The Sith are the new authority here on Taris. They seek to preserve the customs of our world, or so I am told. More than this I cannot say.
22316 := May I be of any further service to you?
22317 := Greetings and good day. I hope your patrolling goes well today. All hail the Sith.
22318 := I don't need anything right now.
22319 := Who do you work for?
22320 := How come there are hardly any aliens around?
22321 := Do you know anything about the gangs in the Lower City?
22322 := Is there some way I can get a shuttle off this planet?
22323 := What can you tell me about the Sith?
22324 := Don't bother me - I'm here on official Sith business!
22325 := Hey, what do you think you're doing? You can't go into the cantina while you're on duty!
22326 := Good. Get back to your patrol route. We need to keep a strong presence in the streets to maintain order here.
22327 := Then you shouldn't be in full uniform! If you're off duty go change your outfit. If not, get back to your patrol route!
22328 := Sorry, I'll be going now.
22329 := I'm not on duty right now.
22330 := Out of our way, citizen - we're on official Sith business! Just stand aside if you know what's good for you!
22331 := Is there anything more boring than being out on patrol? Ah, I guess I shouldn't complain.
22332 := Some of the troops got stuck patrolling the Undercity sewers. That's one assignment I wouldn't want!
22333 := Welcome back. Are you in need of healing or medical supplies? I can treat you right here at the center for almost any condition, except the rakghoul disease, of course.
22334 := You have the serum? Impossible! How did you get this? No, wait... I don't really want to know.
22335 := Can... can I see it? The serum, I mean? I need to see if there is enough for me to analyze it so I can start producing it in mass quantities.
22336 := I'm not a wealthy man. All I can offer is a handful of credits and a few extra medpacs.
22337 := The only other buyer would be the crime lord Davik; but he would charge exorbitant fees for the serum if he got his hands on it! Nobody would be able to afford a cure!
22338 := Please, if you have any compassion at all you'll give the serum to me and not to Davik. Don't let him get a monopoly on this cure.
22339 := Then I guess there's nothing I can do to stop you. I only hope you'll change your mind later on.
22340 := Consider giving the serum to this man... surely we do not have such a dire need for credits that you would prize them over mercy?
22341 := Hmmm.... let me see... yes, this is it! A cure for the rakghoul disease! With this sample I can make enough serum for everyone!
22342 := The people of Taris owe you a debt they can never repay. Please, take this small reward. It isn't much, but it's all I can afford: a few credits and two spare medpacs.
22343 := You're threatening me? I... I don't want this to become violent. Look, here's an extra fifty credits. That's all I have, I swear!
22344 := I won't tell anyone. I promise. Now please, just leave me alone. 
22345 := So you twisted a few extra credits out of him. Hope it was worth it.
22346 := That was unworthy of you. Zelka has the serum, certainly, but only because of your extortion. Were the few extra credits truly worth it?
22347 := [Failure] I'm sorry, but all my credits are spent trying to keep this medical facility operating. I can't spare anymore.
22348 := [Success] I suppose I could give you a discount here at my shop, in addition to the credits and medpacs. Other than that there is really nothing else I can offer.
22349 := I appreciate everything you've done. There are many who would have sold the serum to the crime lord Davik for a much higher sum.
22350 := You truly have a noble and generous spirit, but you deserve something for your effort. Tell you what, I'll give you a discount whenever you shop at my store. It's the least I can do.
22351 := Now, is there anything else I can do for you?
22352 := That is very kind of you. We are just glad we were able to bring some relief to the suffering of these people.
22353 := Welcome to my medical facility. Do you require healing or treatment? I can treat almost any ailment right here at the facility.
22354 := I can even provide a cure for the rakghoul disease, though it is very expensive. Davik has a monopoly on the antidote, and he's selling the serum for a ridiculous fee.
22355 := Davik's doing everything he can to protect his monopoly. All the samples he provides are treated, making it impossible to analyze their composition and create my own stores of the serum. 
22356 := I even have a cure for the rakghoul disease now, thanks to you. With the sample you've brought me I've been able to extract hundreds of vials that will cure the horrible affliction. 
22357 := Of course I sell them at a very reasonable price. Just enough to cover the cost of processing the sample.
22358 := I even have supplies of the rakghoul serum in my inventory, as I have already told you. So what do you need?
22359 := I see from your appearance that you are an off-worlder. Still, you are welcome here. I'll not have it said that Zelka Forn refused to help somebody just because they weren't a citizen of Taris.
22360 := Do you require healing or medical supplies? I can treat almost any injury or ailment right here at the medical facility, except the rakghoul disease, of course.
22361 := Goodbye and good health to you. If you ever need any medical aid or treatment, you know where to find me.
22362 := Of course. Just step over here and I'll show you what I have in stock. My prices are very reasonable, just what I need to keep this facility operating.
22363 := It will just take me a moment while I examine your injuries, and then I'll administer the proper treatment.
22364 := I am quite busy maintaining the facility, but I suppose I could spare a bit of time to answer some questions. What would you like to know?
22365 := Republic escape pods? Uh... no... why would you ask me that? I don't know. Those pods crashed in the Undercity. I'm not involved in any way!
22366 := [Success] There's no need to get the Sith involved! I guess... I guess I can tell you my secret. Or rather, I can show you.
22367 := I'm not defensive! I just don't like being accused of knowing something about those Republic pods. This is as bad as an interrogation by the Sith!
22368 := [Failure] The Sith were already here, asking these same questions. I'll tell you what I told them. I don't know anything about those pods. Now, is there something else you need?
22369 := [Success] Well, you don't look like you're with the Sith. I guess... I guess I can tell you my secret. Or rather, I can show you.
22370 := All I know is what I was told by the people who brought these Republic soldiers here for treatment. They found the wreckage of two escape pods down in the Undercity.
22371 := I don't know much, but I'll tell you what I can. Do you want to know about Upper Taris? Or are you more interested in Lower Taris and the Undercity?
22372 := The Undercity is a wasteland crawling with flesh eating mutants called rakghouls. I feel sorry for the Outcasts that are forced to live there.
22373 := Justice here on Taris is swift and harsh. There are only two punishments - execution, or banishment to the Undercity.
22374 := Anyone banished can never return on pain of death. Even their descendants are forced to live in the depths beneath our great cities.
22375 := Whenever I can I send supplies to the Undercity to help ease the misery of their lives - food, medpacs and serum to cure the rakghoul disease, mostly.
22376 := Whenever I can I send supplies to the Undercity to help ease the misery of their lives, although there is nothing I can do to help those infected with the rakghoul disease.
22377 := The Lower City has been overrun by swoop gangs and thugs. If you're going to travel down there you better go armed.
22378 := If you don't get attacked by one of the swoop gangs, you'll probably end up beaten and robbed by one of Davik's thugs! Soon it will be as bad as the Undercity.
22379 := Davik is the resident crime lord of Taris. He deals in stolen goods, he trades in slaves and contraband, and it would take a month to list all the people he's made "disappear".

22380 := His slimy grasp even reaches here into Upper Taris. Most of the shops pay him protection money so he'll leave them alone. Yeah, the man's nothing but a thug!
22381 := I guess I'm lucky. Since my medical facility doesn't make any profits Davik doesn't bother me. But if you ask me he's no better than the Sith! 
22382 := The people here in the Upper City generally like to think they're better than the rest of Taris, but we're no better than anyone else. 
22383 := The people here can be selfish, greedy, arrogant and even prejudiced. That's why aliens need special permission to leave the Lower City.
22384 := Maybe if more people in the Upper City weren't so self-centered things wouldn't be so bad in the Lower City and the Undercity.
22385 := I know enough to be scared of them. I've heard about the brutality of the Sith. I know what they do to the planets they conquer.
22386 := So far all they've done is ask me some general questions, but I'm afraid they might one day decide to shut this facility down simply out of evil spite.
22387 := I guess there's not much I can do about the Sith, except hope that the Republic finds a way to stop their conquest of the entire galaxy.
22388 := This is a hospital of sorts, though my resources are quite limited since the Sith quarantined the planet. I provide basic medical services to all citizens of and visitors to Taris.
22389 := I have extensive medical training, and even with the lack of resources I can treat most injuries or ailments right here at the center - except for the rakghoul disease, of course.
22390 := The terrible affliction has plagued Taris for many generations. It is spread by the rakghouls, horrible monsters that live in the Undercity below Taris' great skyscrapers.
22391 := Prolonged exposure to the Undercity breeds the disease and those infected will eventually mutate into rakghouls themselves, becoming mindless beasts that feed on the flesh of others. 
22392 := There is no antidote for the disease, though I heard the Republic scientists at the military base here on Taris were close to perfecting a cure. Then the Sith arrived.
22393 := They overran the military base and now they refuse to allow anyone access to the laboratories inside. The Sith are keeping all the serum for the patrols they send into the Undercity.
22394 := If I could just get my hands on a sample of that serum the rakghoul disease could be wiped from the face of Taris forever. But I don't see how that's going to happen.
22395 := I couldn't afford to give you more than a few medpacs and a handful of credits. The medical center can barely afford to stay open as it is. But it hardly matters, anyway.
22396 := I don't see how anyone could get their hands on the serum. The military base is crawling with Sith guards. Breaking in there would be a suicide mission.
22397 := I suppose the Sith patrols in the Undercity might have a sample of the serum on them, if they hadn't already used it because of a rakghoul infection.
22398 := But I doubt a patrol would just hand the serum over. And nobody's stupid enough to attack one of the Sith patrols, even in the Undercity.
22399 := Please don't say that! If the Sith hear you they might think I'm suggesting you start attacking their patrols. They could shut me down!
22400 := I only mentioned the serum because you asked. I don't actually expect anyone to get me the serum. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?
22401 := What... what do you want? Are you here to threaten me again? Well, it won't do you any good. I don't have anything left for you to steal. Can't you just leave me alone?
22402 := I don't want any trouble, I'm just trying to keep my medical facility up and running. Please, just go away and let me do my job.
22403 := I guess I can't turn you away in good conscience. Very well, I will tend to your injuries; but then I expect you to leave my facility.
22404 := Well, I did set this facility up to help those in need, so I suppose I can't really turn you away. Very well, you can see what I have in stock.
22405 := What are you doing? Don't go in there! That door is for employees only!
22406 := You... you recognize these soldiers? But how? Unless... unless you're a friend of the Republic.
22407 := [Success] I guess... I guess I better tell you what's going on. I only hope the Sith don't find out what I've done.
22408 := N-nothing. This... this isn't your concern. Just... just forget you saw anything, okay?
22409 := [Success] What? No! Don't tell the Sith. Please. I... I can explain all this.
22410 := Since the space battle overhead, people have been secretly bringing in these Republic soldiers who crash landed on the planet. I had to take them in. What choice did I have?
22411 := Their injuries are terrible, most won't survive. But at least I can make their last days more comfortable. And at least here they are hidden away from the Sith. 
22412 := I hate to imagine what the Sith would do if they discovered these soldiers here. But since their initial questioning the Sith have not returned, so it may be my fears are unfounded.
22413 := What? You're threatening to turn me in? But... the Sith will torture these soldiers! They'll shut me down! They might even kill me! You can't really mean to turn me in!
22414 := Fine, take these credits to seal your tongue, then leave this place. I don't want to have anything to do with a monster like you! 
22415 := You've got your credits, now please show yourself out. You are no longer welcome here.
22416 := I am outraged! I understand we might need credits to help us get off the planet, but that was unacceptable. In the future please try to remember that we are on the side of justice!
22417 := I understand some extra credits might help us in our mission, but I don't approve of your methods. Zelka's a good man... you shouldn't have done that.
22418 := Don't be absurd. Indulge your darker impulses if you wish, but not at the cost of hurting helpless men. We will not betray this man.
22419 := No, it's *not*. The Sith would torture these men, or worse. You're not threatening this man while I'm present.
22420 := Thank you for keeping my secret. I only wish there was more I could do, but medical science has only come so far.
22421 := I'm afraid there is nothing more anyone can do for these soldiers. Now, if you'll excuse me I should return to the front in case anyone comes in needing medical attention.
22422 := You have taken a great risk to care for these men. I wish we could aid you more, but you have my thanks.
22423 := Well, for that you have my thanks. It's good to know that at least some of these men ended up in compassionate hands.
22424 := The Sith governor said I could keep this medical facility open. I have the proper permits. Please... I don't want any trouble.
22425 := Tell me about the rakghoul disease.
22426 := I have the serum to cure the rakghoul disease.
22427 := Hold on. What about my reward?
22428 := I think I should find another buyer who'll pay more.
22429 := Forget it - I'm going to see Davik.
22430 := Fine, take the serum.
22431 := You better come up with something extra or I'll put a smoking blaster hole right between your eyes!
22432 := Hand it over. And don't mention this to anyone!
22433 := You mention this to anyone and you're a dead man!
22434 := [Persuade] That's it? After all the trouble I went to?
22435 := [Persuade] Are you sure you couldn't spare a little something extra?
22436 := Thank you, Zelka. That would be fine.
22437 := Keep your reward, Zelka. You need it more than I do.
22438 := Here you go.
22439 := What is this place again?
22440 := I'll be going now.
22441 := Let me take a look at what you've got for sale.
22442 := I could use some healing. 
22443 := I want to ask you some questions.
22444 := Do you know anything about the Republic escape pods that crashed in the Undercity?
22445 := [Persuade] If you know something, you better tell me - unless you'd rather talk to the Sith!
22446 := You seem awfully defensive about this.
22447 := [Persuade] Don't worry, I'm not with the Sith. I won't betray your secret if you tell me.
22448 := I just want some general information about Taris.
22449 := I want to ask you something else.
22450 := Tell me about the Undercity.
22451 := Outcasts?
22452 := Tell me about the Lower City.
22453 := What do you know about Davik?
22454 := Tell me about Upper Taris.
22455 := How do you feel about the Sith?
22456 := Medical facility? Is this some kind of hospital?
22457 := Tell me about the rakghoul disease.
22458 := Rakghoul disease? What's that?
22459 := Is there no cure?
22460 := I might be able to help you out... for a price.
22461 := Maybe I could find a way to get my hands on that serum for you.
22462 := Don't worry, Zelka - I'll get that serum for you!
22463 := Fine, I'm going.
22464 := I need healing.
22465 := I need to see your inventory.
22466 := Hey... I recognize these men. They're Republic soldiers!
22467 := [Persuade] I'm a friend of the Republic. You can trust me.
22468 := What's going on here?
22469 := [Persuade/Threat] Either tell me what's going on, or you can explain it to the Sith!
22470 := It's going to cost you if you want me to keep this information secret.
22471 := Not my problem, doc. Hand over some credits or explain all this to the Sith!
22472 := Sorry, I was just making a bad joke. Your secret is safe with me.
22473 := I don't take orders from you. Either Zelka pays up, or I tell the Sith.
22474 := Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
22475 := Is there anything I can do to help?

22571 := You are now wearing the armor.
22572 := You have removed the armor.
22573 := You need more privacy before putting on the armor.
22574 := You need more privacy before removing the armor.
22575 := Thank you, human. The Sith would have killed me... of that I am certain. I don't know who you are, but it is clear you are no friend of the Sith.
22576 := Among my people there is a saying: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Like you I hate the Sith. That is why I stole those Sith uniforms for the Hidden Beks.
22577 := In the Lower City there are some who do not bow to the conquerors. Swoop gangs like the Hidden Beks are gathering resources to one day strike against the Sith oppressors.
22578 := If you wish to strike another blow against the Sith you would be wise to journey to the Lower City and speak with Gadon Thek, the leader of the Hidden Beks.
22579 := As should I. The Sith know my face now, I must find somewhere to hide on this world. Thank you once again, human.
22580 := I am sorry, but all the uniforms I had were given to the Hidden Beks. I suppose you could take the uniforms from the bodies of the Sith soldiers in this room if you wanted.
22581 := Access to the Lower City is restricted, I have never actually met Gadon. My only dealings were with members of his Hidden Bek gang.
22582 := You would have to ask Gadon Thek to know the answer to that question. They approached me, and my only role was to obtain the Sith uniforms for them.
22583 := You wear the uniforms of the Sith, but your actions prove you are not one of them. I... I do not know who you are, but I owe you my life.
22584 := Yes... I have no desire to be here when another patrol comes to investigate these deaths. Goodbye, and thank you once again.
22585 := But... but... no! I won't die like this!
22586 := What are you doing? There's no need to go around drawing attention to ourselves. You there... just get out of here.
22587 := I'm sorry, but I have nothing. As I tried to tell my captors during the interrogation, I am a poor traveler trapped here by the Sith quarantine - nothing more.
22588 := I... I don't know. They thought... they thought I was part of some underground resistance. I don't know why they would suspect me... I'm completely innocent.
22589 := The Hidden Beks? Who are they?
22590 := The Sith were right! You are a spy!
22591 := What are you talking about?
22592 := I should be going now.
22593 := Can I get one of those uniforms from you?
22594 := Can you take me to Gadon?
22595 := What are the Hidden Beks planning?
22596 := Go on, get out of here.
22597 := Now I get the pleasure of killing you myself!
22598 := Is there any kind of reward for saving you?
22599 := Why were those Sith interrogating you?
22600 := You ever seen a swoop bike? I seen them at the races sometimes. They go fast and make lots of noise!
22601 := My Momma says I have to stay out of the Lower City. That's where bad people live.
22602 := Is you one of the Sith? My daddy says the Sith are nothing but bullies. You don't look like a bully.
22603 := You ain't supposed to be here! This ain't your home!
22604 := You're one of them Sith, ain't you? My mommy says I'm not supposed to talk to you.
22605 := That new mercenary working for Davik - I heard he's a Mandalorian! I wonder if he fought in the Mandalore Wars?
22606 := Check this out... we got a real live celebrity here. The Mysterious Stranger mixing with the common folk! 
22607 := I lost a bundle betting against you, Stranger. Next time I'll know better.
22608 := Have you got your tickets for Bendak Starkiller's return to the duel ring? I hear it's going to be an illegal death match!
22609 := I hear the crime lord Davik has a ship that can break through the Sith blockade.
22610 := I hear there's a gang war between the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars raging in the lower city. 
22611 := Hey - didn't you just win the big swoop bike race in the Lower City? Yeah, it was you, I'm sure! That race was amazing!
22612 := Too bad Brejik wouldn't pay up on his wager! Oh well - he got what was coming to him.
22613 := What... what do you want? I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just standing here... please, don't take me in for questioning!
22614 := Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...
22615 := First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch.
22616 := I'm off duty right now, so I'm not in uniform. My name is Sarna - junior officer first class with the Sith occupation force.
22617 := I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this a pretty lonely job.
22618 := You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.
22619 := You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?
22620 := Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!
22621 := It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.
22622 := That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.
22623 := I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party tonight to blow off some steam.
22624 := I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.
22625 := Don't worry - you won't be the only civilian there. A few of the locals who don't hate us are going to show up, too. I hope to see you there. 
22626 := Oh, great... I can see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you. 
22627 := Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!
22628 := I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?
22629 := Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.
22630 := [Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.

22631 := But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.
22632 := [Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.
22633 := Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.
22634 := Good. Move along and leave me alone or I might have to run you in for questioning.
22635 := Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.
22636 := Sorry, but I'm not here looking for conversation. I just came to get a drink, listen to some music and try to relax before my next shift at the military base.
22637 := I don't wear my uniform when I'm off duty. I can do without those hate-filled stares while I'm trying to enjoy myself.
22638 := I shouldn't even be here, to tell the truth. The officers get pretty upset when we fraternize with the locals. But it gets pretty stale hanging around the base all the time.
22639 := Besides, the Sith don't own me. Being a soldier in their fleet is just a job, you know? A job with long hours and low pay, I might add. 
22640 := When I signed up I was promised adventure and excitement in exotic locals. Instead, I end up stationed at a military base on some backwater planet on the fringes of the galaxy.
22641 := If I could just find some other way to earn some credits I could give up this lousy job. It's not like they even need me there. Nobody can get into the base without a keycard.
22642 := Oh... okay. See you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. It might not go over well with my superiors.
22643 := What? Are you offering me a bribe? You realize this is treason, right? If I report you the Sith will have you executed!
22644 := You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.
22645 := I might complain a lot, but it's a big step from complaining to treason. I think... I think maybe we should end this conversation - for both our sakes.
22646 := The truth is I find your offer rather tempting. I could probably get you inside the base. But if we get caught we're dead. You're asking me to take an awful risk.
22647 := If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 2000 credits up front if you want to get inside the base. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?
22648 := Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.
22649 := [Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 2000 credits or no deal.
22650 := [Success] Hmmm... 1000 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.
22651 := Okay, you've got a deal. All you need to get inside the base is my keycard. The trick is to get it to you without the Sith knowing about it. But I've got a plan.
22652 := I'm going to a party with some of the other Sith soldiers tonight. You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take my keycard.
22653 := We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.
22654 := I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party tonight and take the keycard after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?
22655 := I'll probably get a reprimand for carrying my keycard while not on duty, but nothing too serious. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.
22656 := Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.
22657 := I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party later. Just remember - if you get caught breaking into the base, I don't know you.
22658 := Sounds like this could work. Mind you, do we really have another choice?
22659 := You've got to expect at least a little risk if you want some credits, don't you?
22660 := Mmm... I suppose so...
22661 := Hey, now - let's not start making threats. I didn't say I *would* report you, only that I could. This kind of talk is dangerous, you know? But I'm not going to turn you in.
22662 := I don't have the card with me. But everyone who works at the military base has one. Otherwise we wouldn't be able to get inside the base. 
22663 := Well, are you here to close our deal? 2000 credits gets you access to the Military Base. Otherwise we really shouldn't be talking.
22664 := I'm surprised to see you again. I thought you had gotten sick of me complaining about my job at the Sith military base. I guess I kind of obsess about it. That can't be healthy.
22665 := Hey, you made it! I was beginning to wonder if you were going to show! The party's in full swing - come on in.
22666 := You have to try this Tarisian ale - it's fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!
22667 := Careful, Sarna. That wine's got quite the kick. A couple more bottles and we'll all be passed out on the floor!
22668 := Who cares? We're not on duty tomorrow - let's live a little! Come on - drink up!
22669 := Did you come for the party? You really shouldn't be here if you're on duty... I don't want to get in trouble.
22670 := You're welcome to come back after you go change out of your uniform. We'll see you then.
22671 := I'm not interested in chatting right now.
22672 := You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.
22673 := I'm not actually from Taris. I'm just stuck here until the quarantine ends.
22674 := Being stuck on Taris isn't so bad... but the locals aren't much fun.
22675 := Everybody has their ups and downs... it's how you deal with them that counts.
22676 := You've got a pretty positive attitude.
22677 := It must be tough, being stationed on a hostile world.
22678 := You need to blow off steam once in a while.
22679 := I don't think I can make it.
22680 := Sounds good. I'll be there.
22681 := [Persuade] Hey, we're both strangers on Taris. We have to stick together.
22682 := You can't really blame people... you did conquer the planet.
22683 := You seem pretty touchy about this. Maybe you feel a little guilty about what you do.
22684 := Sorry - I'm not trying to judge you.
22685 := [Persuade] You're just doing your job, right? I don't hold that against you.
22686 := I'll be going now.
22687 := You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.
22688 := Sounds like you aren't very happy.
22689 := So why do you do it?
22690 := I'll be going now.
22691 := If you help me get inside the military base I'll make it worth your while.
22692 := Hey, relax - I was just making a joke.
22693 := I don't think you'll report me. I think you've been waiting for an offer like this.
22694 := Forget it - I'm not paying that much!
22695 := I can't afford that much.
22696 := [Persuade] Make it 1000 credits and we have a deal.
22697 := Sounds like a good plan.
22698 := How do I know this isn't some kind of set up?
22699 := Won't you get in trouble if I steal your keycard?
22700 := Okay - here's 2000 credits.
22701 := You report me and I'll tell them how you really feel about your job.
22702 := Do you have a keycard?
22703 := What... what do you want now? You're not going to tell Davik's bounty hunters where I'm hiding, are you?
22704 := But... I already gave you all my money! I don't have anything left. You promised you wouldn't tell Davik where I was!
22705 := You can't tell Davik where I'm hiding with a blaster bolt through your chest!
22706 := Please... please don't hurt me! You don't have to kill me - I'll have Davik's money if he... if he just gives me a little more time! Please, I don't want to die!
22707 := Here - I've got 50 credits on me. That's all I've got. It's yours - just don't tell Davik where I'm hiding, okay? I'm begging you.
22708 := Here - take the credits. But please, just don't tell Davik where I'm hiding. He'll kill me if he finds me!
22709 := You mean you're not here to kill me? But... I thought you were one of Davik's bounty hunters. If you're not here to kill me, what do you want? 
22710 := Just looking around? Oh... okay. Go ahead, look around. Just don't tell Davik I'm here, okay?
22711 := I knew you were here to kill me! Well, I won't go down without a fight!
22712 := I don't think anyone can help me. I owe Davik money, and I was late with the payment. So he went to Zax in the bounty office and put a price on my head! 
22713 := I've been hiding here ever since, but sooner or later someone will find me. Unless I somehow come up with another 200 credits I'm a dead man.
22714 := Thank you - you've saved my life. At least until one of Davik's bounty hunters finds me.
22715 := You'd give 200 credits to a stranger just to help them out?! I... I don't believe it! Thank you!
22716 := Now I can pay off Davik! Oh thank you - you've saved my life! I better go give this to Davik right away!
22717 := You're... you're with the Sith, ain't you? Sure... I recognize the uniform. What... what do you want? I haven't done anything wrong.
22718 := If... if you want to search the place go ahead. I won't stop you. I've got nothing to hide from you.
22719 := Hand over some credits or I'll tell Davik where you're hiding!
22720 := That's too bad. Say hi to Davik's men when they stop by.
22721 := Fine - I'll let you live.
22722 := Give me the credits and I won't tell Davik you're hiding here.
22723 := Don't worry - I'm not going to hurt you.
22724 := I'm just looking around.
22725 := Maybe I should just kill you and collect the bounty.
22726 := Maybe I could help you with your problem with Davik.
22727 := Don't worry - I won't tell anyone you're hiding here.
22728 := Here - I've got 200 credits you can have.
22729 := What are you babbling about?
22730 := There's a bounty on your head, Largo, and I'm here to collect!
22731 := What do you want, civilian? Do you have any information about the missing Sith uniforms? Make it quick!
22732 := Not so fast, civilian... why are you here? Are you a spy? You came to buy Sith uniforms from this alien, didn't you? Didn't you?!
22733 := Right... like I'm going to believe that! A crate of Sith uniforms goes missing and you just happen to wander into the apartment of our prime suspect? That's pretty convenient!
22734 := You're part of some Tarisian underground resistance, aren't you? Time for you to learn how the Sith deal with spies!
22735 := A threat?! I knew you were a spy!
22736 := You're awfully curious about this... maybe a little too curious! I think you know more about those missing uniforms than you're saying!
22737 := Hey, we don't need any reinforcements. All we're doing is searching for some missing Sith uniforms.
22738 := Good - get back to patrolling the streets. We can handle this in here.
22739 := What??? Traitors! Spies! Attack!
22740 := Just move along. There's nothing to see here.
22741 := Where did you hide those Sith uniforms? Did you sell them to the Tarisian underground? Start talking - I want answers!
22742 := Please - I'm only a visitor to Taris, trapped here by your quarantine. I know nothing about the Tarisian underground or your missing Sith uniforms!
22743 := You're a little too curious for your own good, civilian! This doesn't concern you!
22744 := A few of the Sith trooper uniforms have gone missing. We've got evidence that this alien knows something about them, so the commander's interrogating him.
22745 := I'm getting sick of your lies, you alien scum! We got your ugly mug on a security tape from the base! Start talking before I splatter your slimy brains all over this room!
22746 := Uh-oh. I think the commander's losing his temper. I'm glad I'm out here - it took me an hour to clean the blood stains from my uniform after the last interrogation.
22747 := Smart move.
22748 := This is your last chance: where did you hide those uniforms you stole?
22749 := I swear, I don't know what you mean. I'm just... NOOOO!
22750 := Get in here, search the room. I know those uniforms are in here somewhere.
22751 := Who said that? What's going on out there?
22752 := Just stay out of this, if you know what's good for you!
22753 := What was that? Did I hear you right? 'Let' us kill him? How can you stop us?
22754 := Time to teach this civilian the penalty for defying the Sith!
22755 := Time to teach this soldier how we deal with insubordination!
22756 := Then I guess we don't lose anything when the commander blows his head off, do we? Anyway - what do you care?
22757 := I'm sorry... I'll be going now.
22758 := I don't know what you're talking about!
22759 := If I wanted uniforms I'd just kill you and take yours!
22760 := Uniforms? What are you talking about?
22761 := I'll be going now.
22762 := I know... I'm the one who stole them!
22763 := Uniforms? What are they talking about?
22764 := What's going on in there?
22765 := I don't want to get involved in this.
22766 := Stop the interrogation right now!
22767 := Maybe the alien really doesn't know anything.
22768 := You're right. Do whatever you want.
22769 := I won't let you kill a defenseless prisoner!
22770 := Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...
22771 := First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch.
22772 := I'm off duty right now, so I'm not in uniform. My name is Yun Genda - junior officer first class with the Sith occupation force.
22773 := I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this a pretty lonely job.
22774 := You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.
22775 := You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?
22776 := Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!
22777 := It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.
22778 := That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.
22779 := I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party later to blow off some steam.
22780 := I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.
22781 := Don't worry - you won't be the only civilian there. A few of the locals who don't hate us are going to show up, too. I hope to see you there. 
22782 := Oh, great... I see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you. 
22783 := Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!
22784 := I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's just keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?
22785 := Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But hey, can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.
22786 := [Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.

22787 := But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.
22788 := [Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.
22789 := Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with the locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.
22790 := Good. Move along and leave me alone or I might have to run you in for questioning.
22791 := Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.
22792 := Sorry, but I'm not here looking for conversation. I just came to get a drink, listen to some music and try to relax before my next shift at the military base.
22793 := I don't wear my uniform when I'm off duty. I can do without those hate filled stares while I'm trying to enjoy myself.
22794 := I shouldn't even be here, to tell the truth. The officers get pretty upset when we fraternize with the locals. But it gets pretty stale hanging around the base all the time.
22795 := Besides, the Sith don't own me. Being a soldier in their fleet is just a job, you know? A job with long hours and low pay, I might add.
22796 := When I signed up I was promised adventure and excitement in exotic locals. Instead, I end up stationed at a military base on some backwater planet on the fringes of the galaxy.
22797 := If I could just find some other way to earn some credits I could give up this lousy job. It's not like they even need me there. Nobody can get into the base without a keycard.
22798 := Oh... okay. I'll see you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. Eh, might not go over well with my superiors.
22799 := What? Are you offering me a bribe? You realize this is treason, right? If I report you the Sith will have you executed!
22800 := You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.
22801 := I might complain a lot, but it's a big step from complaining to treason. I think maybe we should end this conversation - for both our sakes.
22802 := The truth is I find your offer rather tempting. I could probably get you inside the base. But if we get caught we're dead. You're asking me to take an awful risk.
22803 := If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 2000 credits up front if you want to get inside the base. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?
22804 := Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.
22805 := [Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 2000 credits or no deal.
22806 := [Success] Hmmm... 1000 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.
22807 := Okay, you've got a deal. All you need to get inside the base is my keycard. The trick is to get it to you without the Sith knowing I gave it to you. But I've got a plan.
22808 := I'm going to a party with some of the other Sith soldiers tonight. You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take my keycard.
22809 := We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.
22810 := I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party later and take the keycard after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?
22811 := I'll probably get a reprimand for carrying my keycard while not on duty, but nothing too serious. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.
22812 := Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.
22813 := I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party later. Just remember - if you get caught breaking into the base, I don't know you.
22814 := Sounds like this could work. Not like we have much choice in the matter though, do we?
22815 := Hey, now - let's not start making threats. I didn't say I *would* report you, only that I could. This kind of talk is dangerous, you know? But I'm not going to turn you in.
22816 := I don't have the card with me. But everyone who works at the military base has one. Otherwise we wouldn't be able to get inside the base. 
22817 := Well, are you here to close our deal? 2000 credits gets you access to the Military Base. Otherwise we really shouldn't be talking.
22818 := I'm surprised to see you again. I thought you had gotten sick of me complaining about my job at the Sith military base. I guess I kind of obsess about it. That can't be healthy.
22819 := Hey, you made it! I was beginning to wonder if you were going to show! The party's in full swing - come on in.
22820 := You have to try this Tarisian ale - it's fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!
22821 := Careful, Yun. That wine's got quite the kick. A couple more bottles and we'll all be passed out on the floor!
22822 := Who cares? We're not on duty tomorrow - let's live a little! Come on - drink up!
22823 := Did you come for the party? You really shouldn't be here if you're on duty... I don't want to get in trouble.
22824 := You're welcome to come back after you go and change out of your uniform. We'll see you then.
22825 := I'm not interested in chatting right now.
22826 := You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.
22827 := I'm not actually from Taris. I'm just stuck here until the quarantine ends.
22828 := Being stuck on Taris isn't so bad... but the locals aren't much fun.
22829 := Everybody has their ups and downs... it's how you deal with them that counts.
22830 := You've got a pretty positive attitude.
22831 := It must be tough, being stationed on a hostile world.
22832 := You need to blow off steam once in a while.
22833 := I don't think I can make it.
22834 := Sounds good. I'll be there.
22835 := [Persuade] Hey, we're both strangers on Taris. We have to stick together.
22836 := You can't really blame people... you did conquer the planet.
22837 := You seem pretty touchy about this. Maybe you feel a little guilty about what you do.
22838 := Sorry - I'm not trying to judge you.
22839 := [Persuade] You're just doing your job, right? I don't hold that against you.
22840 := I'll be going now.
22841 := You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.
22842 := Sounds like you aren't very happy.
22843 := So why do you do it?
22844 := I'll be going now.
22845 := If you help me get inside the military base I'll make it worth your while.
22846 := Hey, relax - I was just making a joke.
22847 := I don't think you'll report me. I think you've been waiting for an offer like this.
22848 := Forget it - I'm not paying that much!
22849 := I can't afford that much.
22850 := [Persuade] Make it 1000 credits and we have a deal.
22851 := Sounds like a good plan.
22852 := How do I know this isn't some kind of set up?
22853 := Won't you get in trouble if I steal your keycard?
22854 := Okay - here's 2000 credits.
22855 := You report me and I'll tell them how you really feel about your job.

22925 := Done!
22926 := Ready for Bendak!
22927 := Give me 10000 credits.
22928 := Was that Jergan I just saw you talking to? Do you know where he went?
22929 := Well if you see that slime ball tell him Lana is looking for him! I gave him 20 credits and he promised to get me backstage to meet the band. Then, he disappeared!
22930 := When I tried to get backstage to look for him, nobody even knew who he was! He can't set up a meeting with the band - he's just some sleazy con artist spinning lies!
22931 := I doubt he'd be dumb enough to show up here again; he knows I'm looking for him! And if I ever find him he's going to pay for ripping me off - with interest!
22932 := You fell for his story, too? Well, I got some bad news for you sister - he ain't coming back. I gave him 20 credits last week, and he just disappeared with it!
22933 := No. I have no idea where he went.
22934 := He went backstage to arrange a meeting between me and the band.
22935 := This droid is too busy preparing drinks to take your order.
22936 := Leave me alone... I'm not giving out any autoprints to my fans today.
22937 := Off with you then. I'm done with this conversation anyway.
22938 := Since I'm not going to answer them, you'd just be wasting your breath. So move along before people see us talking and think I'm signing autoprints today. I don't want to be mobbed.
22939 := What, you don't recognize me? I'm Bendak Starkiller, the most famous blaster-slinger on Taris. Over 100 duels without a loss - every one of them a death match!
22940 := I'm retired now. Once death matches became illegal I just got bored with the game. I've got no interest in using stun blasters! There was nobody left to challenge me, anyway.
22941 := I've seen you in the dueling ring, but you haven't impressed me. Now, if you could beat all these other pretenders... that might get my attention.
22942 := I've been watching these new kids in the ring, but I haven't found anyone worth my notice so far. Still, if someone could beat all these other pretenders I might give them a shot.
22943 := But I saw you in the ring against Twitch. You've got enough talent to make me consider coming out of retirement for one last death match - unless you're afraid to face me.
22944 := People are always bugging me for my autoprint. Comes with the territory. You survive over 100 death matches and people tend to see you as something of a legend.
22945 := So you're the one doing Zax's dirty work. Well I've got some bad news for you, little bounty hunter. There's no way you're bringing me in.
22946 := This cantina is wired with a top level security grid. You pull a weapon on me and the auto-fire turrets will fry you before you can even pull the trigger.
22947 := Why would I ever want to leave here? I've got food and drinks, a place to stay - and everybody treats me with the respect I've earned for my dueling career.
22948 := But if you're set on collecting that bounty I'll make you a deal. I kind of miss the fight game; my hand is itching for the feel of a blaster in my grip.
22949 := If you can prove yourself in the ring by beating all these other so-called duelists, I'll agree to face you in a death match. You win, you get to collect that bounty for killing me.
22950 := Good luck with that, kid... you're going to need it. HA-HA-HA!
22951 := You sure you want to get involved in this? Seems a bit pointless to me. Up to you.
22952 := I'm not going to force you to fight. But it's the only way you'll ever collect the bounty on my head. Until then, we've got nothing to talk about.
22953 := I've seen you in the duel ring. You're just good enough to spark my interest, so I'll agree to face you in a death match. You win, you get to collect that bounty for killing me.
22954 := Finally - fresh meat! Ajuur will set it all up; go talk to him. It will take some time to arrange, so no point sticking around here until then. I'll be back when it's time for you to die!
22955 := Hmmm... never figured you for a coward. You ever get the guts to fight me come on back and we can set the match up. Otherwise we've got nothing to talk about.
22956 := Back again? You're starting to bore me. I don't come here to talk - I come to watch the duels and see if there's anyone worthy of stepping into the ring with me.
22957 := Sorry, I don't waste my time with no-names. You have to prove yourself before you get a shot at me. I'm the real deal, kid - 100 death matches without a loss!
22958 := But if you can knock off all these other pretenders in the duel ring, I might consider coming out of retirement to face you in one last death match.
22959 := I've been watching you in the dueling ring. Not bad for an amateur. I'm tempted to come out of retirement and show you what it's like to do battle against a real champion.
22960 := But I only fight in death matches, and not too many people are willing to step into the ring knowing they won't ever come out. How 'bout you, Stranger? You think you got what it takes?
22961 := What are you doing back here? You finally find the guts to meet me in a death match?
22962 := I'll be going now.
22963 := I want to ask you some questions.
22964 := Autoprints? What are you talking about?
22965 := How come you don't hang around with the other duelists?
22966 := You don't look so tough. Maybe you'll take me on.
22967 := I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Bendak!
22968 := You have to leave sometime, Bendak!
22969 := So you'll just hide in here like a coward?
22970 := I'll be back as soon as I beat all these other duelists.
22971 := Forget it - I'm not interested in a death match.
22972 := You're on, Bendak! Name the time and place!
22973 := Forget it - I'm not interested in a death match.
22974 := I'll step into the ring with you Bendak!
22975 := You ever seen a swoop bike? I seen them at the races sometimes. They go fast and make lots of noise!
22976 := My Momma said I have to stay out of the Lower City. That's where bad people live.
22977 := Is you one of the Sith? My daddy says the Sith are nothing but bullies. You don't look like a bully.
22978 := You ain't supposed to be here! This ain't your home!
22979 := Don't you love watching the Pazaak players? All that strategy. All those credits... It's enough to make a girl get all flushed!
22980 := I saw your match against Niklos - if you could even call it that. You aren't much of a Pazaak player, are you?
22981 := I saw your match against Niklos. He doesn't lose very often. I bet you could make a lot of credits as a professional Pazaak player!
22982 := You know, you're my kind of guy; rich and handsome - just the way I like them. Why don't we slip away to the tap room together?
22983 := The bartender can mix us up something special for only twenty credits. If you play your cards right Pazaak might not be the only game you get lucky at tonight.
22984 := What's the matter, you shy? Suit yourself. I'll be here if you change your mind, just waiting for a nice, rich Pazaak player to come along...
22985 := Really? You must not be as good at Pazaak as I thought. Well, I'm not going to waste my time with some penniless gambler!
22986 := Suddenly I find you very boring. Maybe I can find someone more interesting in the tap room.
22987 := Well, I'm used to the finer things in life. I'm not about to lower my standards for any man. So how about it - you want me to get those drinks for us?
22988 := I love a man who's not afraid to spend his credits! I'll meet you in the tap room. Don't be too long - I'm not a patient girl. 
22989 := Wow, are you really a noble? You must be pretty rich, right? Is your family important?
22990 := I can trace my lineage back five generations to one of the founding houses of Taris. In fact... uh, we seem to have some unexpected company, my darling.
22991 := Oh, don't pay any attention to him. He's just some Pazaak player I met. He's not an actual noble, like you! C'mon, sweetie... let's go back to your mansion. 
22992 := Sorry, not interested. 
22993 := I don't have that much on me.
22994 := 20 credits? That seems expensive for a couple of drinks.
22995 := Sounds good to me! Here's 20 credits.
22996 := What are you looking at, fresh meat? You want a piece of me? You want to step into the dueling chambers with me? 
22997 := Yeah, that's right - back off! You know better than to challenge Deadeye Duncan. I will mess you up!
22998 := Big talk. Go speak with the Hutt in the corner to back it up - he's the Duel Organizer. I'll look forward to our match. Fresh meat is just what I need to end my losing streak!
22999 := You know - the dueling chambers: two people in combat, loser gets carried out unconscious on a stretcher. It's the only reason people come into this part of the cantina.
23000 := Look, I'm the number five ranked duelist around here; I don't have time to explain all this. Go talk to the Duel Organizer if you're interested. He's that Hutt over there in the corner.
23001 := I'm Deadeye Duncan, the number five ranked duelist in this cantina. You must have seen me in the dueling chambers, right?
23002 := Uh... five. But it's an elite group, okay? It's not like just anyone can step into the dueling chamber! Well, actually anyone can... but not many do!
23003 := Back for more, eh? I thought you would have learned your lesson by now: don't step into the dueling ring with Deadeye Duncan!
23004 := Yeah yeah, off you go. Run away like the coward you are!
23005 := Questions? Ha! I don't think so, Stranger! You don't get to ask me questions; I beat you in the ring - I OWN you!
23006 := I may have lost 54 consecutive matches before I beat you, but I figure I've got your number! You want to step into the ring again, just tell the duel organizer to set it up!
23007 := What do you want? Oh, let me guess - you beat me in the dueling ring and now you're here to rub it in my face! Yeah well, I'm used to it. So pardon me if I ignore your gloating.
23008 := Oh. Well... okay. Goodbye, then.
23009 := Gee, I wonder why? Couldn't have anything to do with being the WORST duelist on Taris, could it? Even a rookie like you got the better of me!
23010 := Questions? I don't have to answer your questions just because you beat me in the ring!
23011 := Look, I admit it - you're better than me. Everyone is better than me! A blindfolded, one-legged tach with a rusty knife could probably beat me, okay?
23012 := Is that what you wanted to hear? You satisfied yet? Are you happy now that you've taken the last shred of dignity I have?
23013 := Slime-rat.
23014 := You beat Ice! I've been trying to beat her for years, and you do it just like that! Heh. I can't believe how lucky you are!
23015 := That's right - I said lucky! Lucky to be born with the kind of talent I've spent a life time trying to build. It isn't fair, I tell you!
23016 := Wow - you're the new champ. Congratulations, I guess. You know, when you started out I actually thought I'd be able to crawl up from my last place ranking for a while.
23017 := Shows what I know. Enjoy your time at the top, Stranger. Sooner or later someone will come along to knock you down here with the rest of us grinders!
23018 := This is great! You beat Bendak - you're a legend! Whenever anyone asks I can say I was the first duelist the Mysterious Stranger ever beat in the ring! I'm going to be famous!
23019 := I heard you challenged Bendak Starkiller. I'll probably watch the fight... but forgive me if I don't go to your funeral.
23020 := Goodbye.
23021 := You don't look so tough. I think I could beat you in a duel.
23022 := Dueling chambers?
23023 := Who are you?
23024 := You're the number five ranked duelist? Out of how many?
23025 := Goodbye.
23026 := I want to ask you some questions.
23027 := I want a rematch!
23028 := Uh... I'll just be going now.
23029 := Wow - you sure have a bad attitude.
23030 := I want to ask you some questions.
23031 := Yeah, I'm happy now.
23032 := Ladies and gentlemen, draw your eyes to the center ring! We have a very special presentation in store for you: 
23033 := You've seen him lose night after night after night. But this time, he's after fresh meat. In this corner I give you Deadeye Duncan!
23034 := In this corner, one of the greats; a man so tough even a disfiguring injury couldn't end his career. I give you Gerlon Two-Fingers!
23035 := And in the other corner, a relative newcomer to the Taris dueling scene. Emerging from the shadows with no history, no past and no name... the Mysterious Stranger!
23036 := Over in this corner, a woman with steel on her bones and ice water in her veins. She's cold and quick as death itself. You know her, you love her... Ice!
23037 := And in the other corner, a rising star taking that first step into the big leagues... I give you the Mysterious Stranger!
23038 := He's a legend in the sport, a twenty year veteran who still knows how to show the young kids a trick or two. Let's have a big hand for... Marl!
23039 := But there's always some young gun coming up to knock the veterans off... and we've got one of the best right here! I give you, the Mysterious Stranger!
23040 := Hold on to your seats and stay back from the edges of the ring! He's wild, he's unpredictable, he's borderline psychotic... and he's the best damn duelist in the game today. Give it up for Twitch! 
23041 := But Twitch's opponent plans to take the champion down! Night after night, battle after battle we've watched this young phenom rise through the ranks... 
23042 := In this corner, the challenger for the title of Taris Dueling Champion - the Mysterious Stranger!
23043 := Ladies and gentlemen, come with me now on a journey to the savage days of years gone by... to a time when two combatants entered the arena, and only one came out alive.
23044 := They're illegal, they're banned, they've been outlawed for nearly ten years - but we've got one for you tonight! A good, old fashioned death match!
23045 := In this corner, a living legend. A man who's very name would make his opponents shake in their boots... if any of them were still alive. Ha ha ha! Out of retirement for one last battle: Bendak Starkiller!
23046 := And who would be crazy enough to step into the ring with such a lethal legend? Who would be mad enough to face almost certain death merely for your enjoyment?
23047 := Ladies and gentlemen, feast your wondering eyes on... the Mysterious Stranger!
23048 := And now, the moment we've all been waiting for... LET THE DEATH MATCH BEGIN!
23049 := It's over! The fight is over! The Mysterious Stranger has won!
23050 := Twitch's reign of terror is over! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new champion - the Mysterious Stranger!
23051 := Marl is down, and questions abound! Is this the end for the long time vet? Is it time for Marl to hang up his spurs? And what of the Mysterious Stranger? 
23052 := Twitch is waiting in the wings... do you dare take a shot at the champion himself? Will the wild-eyed wonder finally be unseated?
23053 := Ice is knocked out cold! Looks like we have a rising star in the Mysterious Stranger, folks: but how high can this star soar? You'll just have to watch and see!
23054 := Gerlon losing to a rookie: is this a sign that his injuries have finally caught up with him? Or is the Mysterious Stranger for real? Only time will tell!
23055 := But really, are any of us surprised? Deadeye losing isn't news. You have to do better than that to impress us, Stranger!
23056 := The Stranger is down! The Mysterious Stranger is down!
23057 := Twitch has done it! Once again the wild-eyed champion has defended his title! But don't give up, Stranger - we all want to see you go after the champ again!
23058 := Marl has done it again! Twenty years and still going strong for the veteran. And a hard lesson for the up and coming rookie. Better luck next time, Stranger.
23059 := Ice wins! Once again the Queen of Mean has dispatched her opponent in the ring. Hard luck, Stranger, but Ice is tough. She never goes down easy.
23060 := Gerlon Two-Fingers gets the win! And, for a change, it wasn't against Duncan. This has got to be a tough loss for the Mysterious Stranger. Imagine: losing to a crippled opponent!
23061 := This is unbelievable, folks! Deadeye Duncan has won a fight! Is it possible we have a new contender for the title of worst duelist ever? Only time - and a possible rematch - will tell!
23062 := Bendak is down! It's over! It's over! The fight is over! Bendak Starkiller is down! Bendak Starkiller is dead!
23063 := All hail the Mysterious Stranger, the greatest duelist to ever grace the rings of Taris!
23064 := Ladies and gentlemen, I draw your attention to the dueling ring. Here, two combatants will battle for your viewing and gambling enjoyment.
23065 := Now, I hope all your bets are down, because we're ready to roll! In this corner, I give you... Gerlon Two-Fingers!
23066 := And over here, looking to climb the ranks yet again is the ever persistent Deadeye Duncan!
23067 := And, to nobody's great surprise, Deadeye is down again. Don't worry, folks - he's just unconscious. As usual. Our medics will have him up and about in a bit.
23068 := Well, that was quick, wasn't it? So I give you the winner... Gerlon Two-Fingers!
23069 := Talk to Ajuur, he's in charge here.
23070 := This is to test the duels. Do you want to win or lose the duel?
23071 := You lose. Go talk to the duel organizer.
23072 := You win. Go talk to the duel organizer.
23073 := Bendak is dead. No more duels for you. Goodbye.
23074 := Lose.
23075 := Win.
23076 := Marl's been around forever. I wonder if he ever thinks about retiring?
23077 := You're not so hot, Stranger. Everybody beats Duncan
23078 := Look - it's the Mysterious Stranger! You're just great! I watch all of your matches!
23079 := None of these fighters would stand a chance against Bendak Starkiller! 
23080 := I hope the authorities don't hear about this death match - they'll shut it down if they find out!
23081 := I never saw a death match before. I thought it would be exciting, but it was actually kind of gross...
23082 := Twitch is my favorite - he's wild!
23083 := I love watching Ice fight! She proves this isn't just a man's game!
23084 := Why doesn't Duncan just give the sport up? He's terrible.
23085 := Hey - you're one of the duelists! The one they call the Mysterious Stranger - sure, I know you.
23086 := Can I have your autoprint, Stranger? I'm your biggest fan!
23087 := I like your style, Stranger. You're the best thing the duel ring's seen since Bendak Starkiller retired!
23088 := Hey, Stranger... I like watching you in the ring. It's enough to make a girl get all flushed. 
23089 := I couldn't believe Duncan's last match. How could he lose to a raw rookie - no disrespect, of course. Duncan's so pathetic!
23090 := I saw Bendak Starkiller sitting in the Pazaak room. I wish he'd come out of retirement. 
23091 := I guess Twitch is next up for you, eh? Good luck - you'll need it!
23092 := I hear you're going to fight Bendak Starkiller! This is great - I'm finally going to get to see a real death match!
23093 := You beat Bendak Starkiller! I can't believe it... you actually beat him!
23094 := That Twitch is an animal! You couldn't pay me enough to get into the ring with him.
23095 := You'd think Duncan would want to retire after losing to a raw rookie, but old Deadeye is still at it. Gotta admire his persistence, I guess.
23096 := So when are you going to take on Twitch? He's crazy, but he's fast. Damn fast. Still, I think you can beat him.
23097 := It's too bad Bendak Starkiller retired - I'd like to see you take him on.
23098 := Everybody's talking about the big death match between you and Bendak. I just hope the Sith don't decide to shut it down.
23099 := Hey - it's the Mysterious Stranger! Great match against Bendak Starkiller - truly one for the ages.
23100 := Gerlon used to be one of the best in the game. Now he's barely better than old Deadeye Duncan.
23101 := I love watching Ice in the ring! Is there anything more exciting than a woman who's armed and dangerous?
23102 := It's good to see Marl's still around after all these years. He proves this isn't just a young man's game.
23103 := I recognize you - you're that new duelist everyone's talking about: the Mysterious Stranger.
23104 := Can I have your autoprint, Stranger? I'm your biggest fan!
23105 := You're good, Stranger. As good as I ever seen - with the exception of Bendak Starkiller, of course.
23106 := Hey, Stranger... I like watching you in the ring. Nothing's more exciting than a woman who isn't afraid to deal out the hurt. It's too bad I'm married... 
23107 := Congratulations on your first win. Of course, you beat Duncan so it's nothing to get too excited about.
23108 := I wish Bendak Starkiller would get back into the fight game. None of these duelists here can measure up to his legend!
23109 := You gonna fight Twitch soon? I'd love to see that crazy psycho get what's coming to him!
23110 := Ha ha. I don't believe this - you're actually going to fight Bendak Starkiller in a death match! No way I'm going to miss this!
23111 := I never thought anyone would ever beat Bendak. A hundred years from now people will still be talking about you!
23112 := You're back, human. Does this mean you want to step into the duel ring? It could be very profitable for both of us. Ask around - everyone knows Ajuur treats his fighters well.
23113 := Ah, Mysterious Stranger... I knew you'd be back. They all come back.
23114 := You've come for a duel, right? I can set up a match and we'll make some money, yes? You get ten percent of the purse if you win.
23115 := You want to step into the ring now? Are you ready to prove yourself against the best duelists on Taris?
23116 := I have big plans for you next match, tiny human. You come back when you want to fight.
23117 := Questions? Bah - I don't have time for questions. They don't make me any credits! I want you to fight, not to ask questions. So, are you ready to step into the ring?
23118 := Not ready? You look ready to me! Why are you here if you don't want to fight? You don't get paid if you don't fight! Come on... are you sure you don't want to step into the ring?
23119 := You've beaten almost everyone, human. I think you ready to fight Twitch. Twitch might be crazy, but he's the best in the game. If you can beat him, you'll be the new champion.
23120 := You've got a real talent for this game, Stranger. I think it's time you fought Marl. He's getting up there in years, but he's still very, very good. He used to be the duel champion.
23121 := I think you're ready to go against Ice, human. She's tough, but so are you. There'll be lots action on this fight... a huge purse! You ready?
23122 := You handled Duncan pretty well. I think you're ready to fight Gerlon Two-Fingers. Just remember - Gerlon uses blasters in the ring sometimes. You ready to step into the arena?
23123 := Yes! You fight and people bet and I make money! It's all good. Only one rule - nobody dies. Your opponent goes down, you don't finish them off. Death matches are illegal now. 
23124 := You new at this, so I'll start you off easy. You get to fight Deadeye Duncan. Are you ready to go into the ring now?
23125 := You say you're ready, then you change your mind? Is this a joke to you? I don't have time for jokes - they don't make me any money! Come back when you'r ready to fight.
23126 := You lost last time, but maybe this time fortune will smile on you. I'll give you a you rematch and a chance to redeem yourself.
23127 := You're getting quite the reputation, Stranger. Everyone's excited, they all want to bet on your next match. I'm excited, too... more bets means more credits for me!
23128 := My latest find; my new rising star. We make good team. I'm making money, you're getting famous... it's all good.
23129 := You want to set up another fight, right? The ring is in your blood now, like a virus. You need to hear the cheers of the crowd; you need the rush of battle... you need to fight again.
23130 := You fought well last time. People like you, Stranger. They bet lots on your last fight. They'll be more on your next fight. You get ten percent, same as always.
23131 := I'm sorry, human - the betting window's closed. No more fights right now. People are sick of seeing the same duelists all the time. It's bad for business. Unless...
23132 := My name is Ajuur. I organize all the duels here. We need a new face in the dueling game, human. Maybe you want step into the duel ring? It can be a highly profitable venture.
23133 := Don't pass this opportunity up, human. You fight for me and I'll make you rich. If you change your mind you come back and talk to me again.
23134 := Questions? Bah - questions don't make me money! But if you want to fight, it would could be very profitable for both of us. You interested?
23135 := I can arrange for you to fight in the duel ring. If you win, you get the standard contract: 10% of all wagers. And don't worry, nobody dies in the duel ring anymore. Death matches are illegal now.
23136 := Most fighters in the duel ring use vibroblades or stun sticks because the ring's pretty small, but a few of the duelists use blasters. Use whichever you prefer.
23137 := The duel ring has energy suppressor fields to make sure nobody dies. Weapons are limited so they hurt, but don't kill. And we've got a medic droid in case of serious injuries. Are you interested?
23138 := [Failure] Ha-ha-ha! You're joking, right? If I pay you more, then everyone wants more.
23139 := No, you get the same as all the others - ten percent. That's my final offer.
23140 := Good - new blood for the ring! But you need a nickname, like Ice or Deadeye or Twitch. Good nicknames make people bet more. Hmmm... what's a good name for you?
23141 := You're an off-worlder. You're new here, people won't recognize you... I know! From now on in the duel ring you'll be the Mysterious Stranger!
23142 := Bah - what do you know about nicknames? I've been giving names for twenty years! Mysterious Stranger - that's your name now.
23143 := The Mysterious Stranger is a perfect name for you. You've got no past, no history... it makes you seem like you have some big, dark secret. People like that. Makes them bet more.
23144 := You ready for a duel now? You want step into the ring right away? I'll set you up with Deadeye Duncan to start. I'll tell you the rules if you're ready.
23145 := Good fight, good fight. People like you, Mysterious Stranger. They bet a lot when you fight. It makes me happy... and rich.
23146 := I always pay my debts. You won, so you get paid. Ten percent of the purse - that was the deal. Here's your credits. You come see me when you're ready to fight again.
23147 := Too bad you lost, though. I don't pay you for losing. But I'll give you a rematch if you want one. What do you say?
23148 := I hope you're not giving up, Stranger. You lost this time, but maybe next time you'll win. You come speak to me if you ever want a rematch.
23149 := Yes - rematch! People always bet lots on a rematch! And who knows, Stranger... maybe you'll even win this time.
23150 := Mysterious Stranger - why are you here? I don't have anyone who wants to fight you - you're too good for your own good. Nobody wants to go in the ring with you.
23151 := The only one left who'll fight you is Bendak Starkiller, but he's retired. Too bad. People would pay a fortune to see you fight Bendak.
23152 := The only one who'd fight you was Bendak Starkiller, but you killed him. Now I'll never find anyone to fight you. I'm sorry to say, but your dueling career is over, Stranger.
23153 := I've heard the news, Mysterious Stranger. You and Bendak are planning a death match. This is excellent news... people will bet a fortune on this fight!
23154 := But why are you here now? A death match takes time to get ready. I have to bribe officials so they don't break it up. You might as well leave the cantina for now and come back later.
23155 := But why are you here now? Setting up a death match takes time. You might as well leave the cantina for now. Next time you come back we should be ready for the fight.
23156 := Not too many people want to fight a death match anymore. Some are scared, others think it's wrong to kill someone else for credits. I guess that's why they're illegal now.
23157 := This fight is different than most, of course. We'll turn off the energy suppressor, so weapons won't be limited - they can kill. Anything goes. So, you ready to fight this match now?
23158 := You're not ready? What are you waiting for? Are you scared? Look, don't worry about it. I'll wait. You just come back when you're ready to fight.
23159 := Good. Excellent. High wagering means lots of credits for the winner on this match. Come see me after the fight to collect your credits - if you're still alive.
23160 := What? What are you talking about? No, no, no. I was just making idle chatter, it doesn't mean anything! Bendak is an evil, evil man. Killing him would be a good thing.
23161 := Why don't you think this over? Think about all those credits you'll get if you kill Bendak. Then come back and talk to me. I'm confident you'll want to step into the ring.
23162 := Bendak Starkiller's dead! I don't believe it! Bendak never loses... that was an amazing duel! Best duel I've ever seen!
23163 := You've done well, Stranger. I'm pleased. Very pleased. Here are your credits. Plus, I'll give you Bendak's blaster pistol as bonus as a sign of my appreciation.
23164 := [Failure] I always pay my debts, but if you get more then all the duelists will want more. We had a deal - ten percent. I expect you to honor it.
23165 := You'd lie about me? Maybe it would have been better if Bendak had killed you in that ring. But you're still alive, and I can't afford to have a new legend disparaging my reputation.
23166 := Okay, you win. Here's another 200 credits... more than fair. Now don't be accusing me of not paying my fighters; I've got a reputation to protect! 
23167 := [Success] Very well, Stranger. I like you, and this was a special fight. Biggest purse I've ever handled! I'll give you a little bonus this one time only.
23168 := Everyone will be talking about you now, Stranger. They're all going to know you were the one who killed Bendak Starkiller. You're famous now.
23169 := Goodbye.
23170 := I want to ask you some questions.
23171 := I'm not ready for the match yet.
23172 := I'm ready for a duel.
23173 := I've changed my mind.
23174 := Let's do it.
23175 := Sorry, I'm not interested.
23176 := I just want to ask you some questions.
23177 := I might be interested - what's in this for me?
23178 := What are you talking about?
23179 := [Persuade] I'll do it, but I want more than ten percent.
23180 := Okay, I'll do it.
23181 := That's a terrible name!
23182 := The Mysterious Stranger. I like it.
23183 := No - not right now.
23184 := Give me a rematch.
23185 := Let's get on with the match!
23186 := I'm not ready yet.
23187 := I'm ready!
23188 := Maybe it is wrong to take a life just for credits.
23189 := Sounds like your just trying to rationalize this. I need to think this over.
23190 := You're right - let's do this!
23191 := Cut the flattery - just get to my credits.
23192 := I know, I know - I'm a living legend. Now, what about my cut?
23193 := Glad you enjoyed it. Now where's my share of the purse?
23194 := [Persuade] I think I deserve a little extra for putting my life on the line. 
23195 := Pay up, you overgrown slug, or I'll tell people you went back on our deal! Your reputation will be ruined!
23196 := Okay, I'll take the ten percent.
23197 := Thank you Ajuur. That's very generous of you.
23198 := Are you our waiter? Gana's buying tonight. Talk to her to get my order. 
23199 := Why do you poor folk always smell so funny? 
23200 := Do I know you? No? Then why are you speaking to me?
23201 := Where did you get those clothes - a trash compactor in the Lower City? And where are those drinks we ordered? 
23202 := Why is the help here so incompetent? One word from Daddy and I could get you fired! 
23203 := How dare you speak to me like that! Daddy's going to hear about this!
23204 := [Failure] It's too late for apologies! Daddy's going to hear about this! You'll lose your job for sure! 
23205 := [Success] That's better! Now hurry up with our order!
23206 := Here are your drinks, Miss Lavin. I apologize for the delay.
23207 := Help! Daddy!
23208 := You need a lesson on how to treat your social betters. Maybe you'll think twice before mocking me next time!
23209 := Don't bother me... I don't speak to the help
23210 := Order? I have no clue what you're talking about.
23211 := Shut up, you spoiled brat!
23212 := I don't even work here! 
23213 := [Persuade] I'm sorry, don't get upset. I'll go get that drink. 
23214 := Who are you and why are you bossing me around?
23215 := Sorry, I'm not your waiter. 
23216 := Hello there, youngster. You interested in buying the Pazaak deck of an old man looking to get out of the gambling game?
23217 := Just fifty credits and I'll sell you all my cards. I'll even throw in a free lesson to boot. It's a great deal, if you can afford it.
23218 := Of course, of course. No sense in a youngster like you wasting your days away with an old man in a dingy bar. But if you ever want to chat, you know where to find me.
23219 := Glad to see you're interested in the grand old game. The rules are pretty simple. Here: I'll load them up into your datapad so you can check them out anytime you want.
23220 := Good luck: I hope the game's as good to you as it was to me. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?
23221 := Don't get me wrong, the game's been good to me over the years. I've traveled the span of the galaxy, from the Core Worlds to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim.
23222 := I've won countless fortunes... and lost countless more. But that was long ago, and things have changed. Gambling is a young man's game.
23223 := That's why I sold my old deck to you. I don't have what it takes anymore, and I hate to let my cards go to waste.
23224 := That's why I'm looking to get out. My offer still stands - fifty credits gets you my old Pazaak deck and a free lesson. A great offer if you can afford it.
23225 := I'm sorry to hear that, but fifty credits is my best offer. I'm practically giving the deck away at that price. If you want it, it's yours. If not, no hard feelings.
23226 := My name's Garouk. I used to be a card shark - one of the best Pazaak players on the Outer Rim. But that was before I retired from the gambling life.
23227 := Back again? Is there something old Garouk can do for you, or did you just come to chat with a lonely old man?
23228 := Of course, of course. My mind isn't as sharp as it used to be - that's why I'm giving up the gambler's life. But I think I can still manage to answer some simple questions.
23229 := I spend my days here in the cantina, sipping ale and chatting with the folks who wander by. I don't have much use or care what goes on outside these walls.
23230 := Mmm. Don't know what I can tell you that would be any use. The Upper City is nice enough, though it was better before the Sith showed up. But they don't bother an old guy like me much.
23231 := Don't know much about the Lower City. It's rough down beneath. I just stay up here where it's safe and mind my own business.
23232 := I don't see much point in worrying about that kind of stuff now that I've given up the gambler's life. Is there anything else I can do for you?
23233 := Is it true what everyone's saying? That you're going to fight Bendak Starkiller in a death match? You know, I'd love to see someone take that arrogant fool down!
23234 := Pretty soon all of Taris will be talking about how you beat Bendak in that fight, Stranger. You're famous now - but that's not necessarily a good thing.
23235 := The more well known you are the more chance the Sith will take an interest in you. And nobody wants that kind of attention.
23236 := I'll be going now.
23237 := Sure, I'll buy your deck.
23238 := You're giving up gambling? Why?
23239 := I can't afford that.
23240 := Who are you?
23241 := Could you explain the rules of Pazaak again?
23242 := I want to ask you some questions.
23243 := Do you know anything about those Republic escape pods that crashed down in the Undercity?
23244 := I want some general information on Taris.
23245 := I haven't seen you around here before. You looking to step into the duel ring, or did you just come to watch?
23246 := Fair enough. Goodbye, then.
23247 := Good to see some new blood in the fight game. Things have gotten pretty stale around here lately. 
23248 := If you're serious about this go talk to Ajuur the Hutt. He's the Duel Organizer. He'll probably start a rookie like you out against Duncan.
23249 := What? Why are you here if you don't even know what the dueling ring is?
23250 := I don't have time to answer your questions - I need to stay focused for my next match. Maybe Ajuur can help you out. He's the Hutt over in the corner. He arranges all the duels.
23251 := You seem to be hanging around here an awful lot. You actually going to step into the duel ring sometime, or are you just here to watch?
23252 := I saw you your match against Duncan. Not bad for a rookie, but Deadeye's a joke. Even after I lost the use of my fingers I can still beat him!
23253 := Go talk to Ajuur, the Duel Organizer, if you want to step up to the big leagues. I'll show you what it's like to fight a real duelist.
23254 := You beat me fair and square, Stranger. But if I still had the use of my fingers you wouldn't have won! Back before my injury I would've mopped the ring up with you!
23255 := First I go down to an injury, and now it looks like Marl's been dropped by old age. No room in this game for the veterans anymore, I guess.
23256 := But don't get cocky, kid! One day it'll happen to you too! Time catches up to us all, sooner or later. Well, everyone except Bendak Starkiller.
23257 := I don't think you had a chance against Bendak, but you sure showed me. You showed us all. Too bad your career as a duelist is over now.
23258 := I mean, nobody's going to be stupid enough to go up against you anymore - not even Twitch! Kind of funny, isn't it? You win the big match, and you kill your career!
23259 := You're good, Stranger. I'll give you that. But going up against Bendak is suicide! Even before I lost feeling in my fingers I wouldn't have risked a death match with the Starkiller!
23260 := I'll be going now.
23261 := I want to ask you some questions.
23262 := I want to step into the ring.
23263 := Duel ring? What are you talking about?
23264 := Wait, I know what you're going to say: it's great to see a woman in the duel ring, strike a blow for equality, I'm a credit to my gender, blah, blah, blah. Just save it, okay?
23265 := I'm just here to take care of business in the dueling ring. For some reason every woman who comes in here thinks we should have some kind of female bond. Guess what? We don't!
23266 := Wait, I know what you're going to say: I'm so beautiful, I'm so attractive, how can someone who looks so hot with a weapon in her hand be called Ice? Well, I've heard it all before. 
23267 := I'm here to take care of business in the dueling ring, not to have some slack-jawed, goggle-eyed man slobber all over me. So back off! 
23268 := You know what? I'm not one for friendly chit-chat, so I'm just going to deliver the cold, hard facts: I don't want to waste anymore time with you.
23269 := You don't know about the dueling ring? This is unbelievable! Then why are you even here? Wait - never mind. I don't really care.
23270 := Now you know why they call me Ice. If you're looking for a match, go talk to the Ajuur. He's that big Hutt over there in the corner. Otherwise, just go away.
23271 := Back again? Didn't you get the message last time - I'm not here to make friends. Talk to the Duel Organizer if you want a match, otherwise leave me alone.
23272 := What do you want? Wait, let me guess - now that you're a duelist you figure we have something in common? Something to chat about, right?
23273 := Wrong! Just because we're both duelists doesn't mean we're suddenly friends. So give me some space, Stranger. I've got nothing more to say to you.
23274 := I've never been one to shy away from the cold, hard truth so I'll just come right out and say it: I can't compete with the likes of you, Stranger. I know when I'm overmatched.
23275 := You're good - very good. But you're wrong if you think that means I'm suddenly going to warm up to you. Truth is, I really don't have anything more to say, so you might as well move on.
23276 := I heard you're going to fight Bendak Starkiller, Stranger. I'm not one to mince words, so let me just say this: you're dead. He'll kill you, end of story.
23277 := You think I'm cold and hard, wait until you step into the ring with him. He's a natural born killer. You had great potential, Stranger. Too bad you're going to throw it all away.
23278 := Congratulations, Stranger. I never thought anyone would beat Starkiller. Did you know it was because of him that I became a duelist in the first place?
23279 := As a little girl I used to dream of meeting him one day. When I finally did, the guy was a complete slime ball. Made me realize I had to be cold and ruthless to survive, like him.
23280 := And now he's dead. There's probably a lesson in there somewhere. Something for me to think about, at least. Congratulations again, Stranger... and goodbye.
23281 := I just want to ask you some questions.
23282 := Dueling ring? What are you talking about?
23283 := Wow - that was cold!
23284 := Well, hello there! I see from your exotic appearance that you are not from Taris originally. Allow me to introduce myself - my name is Jergan.
23285 := What do you think of our local music? The band is quite good, wouldn't you agree? They're on the verge of intergalactic stardom, you know. 
23286 := They are something of an acquired taste. But mark my words, they'll be famous soon enough. They were about to go on tour before this Sith quarantine stranded them here.
23287 := Would you like to meet the band after the show? Maybe have a brief brush with fame before they become intergalactic superstars? I can arrange it, you know.
23288 := Are you certain? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity - meet the legends before they were famous. All it will cost you is a small handful of credits.
23289 := I have a standing arrangement with one of the Rodian bodyguards backstage. For the small sum of 20 credits he'll let me set up a meeting with you and the band.
23290 := Obviously you have an ear for music. Mark my words, they'll be famous soon enough. They were about to go on tour before this Sith quarantine stranded them here.
23291 := The exotic beauty returns. Hello again, my dear. Have you changed your mind? Do you want to take me up on my offer? Just twenty credits and I can arrange a meeting with the band. 
23292 := That's too bad. They really are charming fellows. Very well, then - I hope you enjoy the music. If you change your mind come speak with me again.
23293 := You sting me with your words! I merely thought I could offer you the rare opportunity to meet a celebrity before they were famous. But I see you're not interested.
23294 := Well, I would like to help you but I can't arrange the meeting for free. And I'm afraid your feminine charms would have little effect on the Rodian bodyguards backstage.
23295 := If you manage to come up with the credits just come back and see me. I'll be more than happy to arrange for you to meet the band. Until then, please enjoy the music. 
23296 := Excellent. Wait here while I go set it up with my contact. I'll give him your credits, then I'll come back out and take you to meet the band.
23297 := No hard feelings, my good man, but I can't really talk with you right now. It's difficult enought to draw the interest of the ladies in this establishment as it is.
23298 := Surely you understand what I'm talking about. I'd guess you've experienced many lonely evenings... something I'm hoping to avoid tonight.
23299 := These guys are the worst!
23300 := I don't much care for the band.
23301 := I'll pass.
23302 := Sure, I'd like to meet them.
23303 := How will you arrange that?
23304 := It's different, but I like it.
23305 := They're very good.
23306 := I'm not interested in meeting the band.
23307 := Sounds like you're running a scam to me.
23308 := I can't afford that much.
23309 := I want to meet the band. Here's twenty credits.
23310 := I heard the Sith sent a bunch of patrols into the Undercity. Probably want to loot the crash sites of those Republic escape pods that went down there. 
23311 := Hey! You heard the latest rumor? Bendak Starkiller is coming out of retirement for one last illegal death match! Oohoo! I'm not missing this!
23312 := Hey, I know you - you're the Mysterious Stranger! I saw you beat Bendak in the dueling ring! Ha! I lost a bundle betting against you!
23313 := I learned my lesson - next time I'll wager my credits on you my friend. If there is a next time. I doubt anyone will be stupid enough to step into the ring with you now. Heh heh heh.
23314 := Have you gone into the music room in the back? Yeah, I don't care much for the band, but those dancing Twi'leks are something else, I'm telling you now!
23315 := You like Pazaak? I used to watch it all the time when Gelrood was playing here. He had some great matches against Niklos... until they banned him for cheating.
23316 := Have you heard the reports? They're saying someone broke into the military compound! Oho! The Sith aren't going to like that.
23317 := The Lower City is nothing but a slum! If the Sith want to win us Tarisians over they should clean the gangs out of there!
23318 := Hey - I saw you win the big swoop race! Too bad Brejik had to get greedy and ruin everything!
23319 := When that fight broke out I just ran for my life. I never even got a chance to cash in my betting slips!
23320 := Look at Niklos sitting over there with his Pazaak deck. I used to play, you know. But I wasn't very good. I finally sold my deck and gave it up. 
23321 := Bendak Starkiller is coming out of retirement! Everyone's talking about it! Some spacer agreed to fight him in an illegal death match! I wonder how I can get a ticket?
23322 := You... you're the one who killed Bendak Starkiller, aren't you? What a match - best duel I ever saw! You know, you might want to lay low for a while.
23323 := Death matches are illegal; the Sith could arrest you if they ever found out about it. Of course, I think I saw several of the Sith officers at the match, so maybe they don't care.
23324 := The Sith are hunting for any Republic soldiers who escaped the battle overhead. They even sent a patrol into the Undercity to look for survivors!
23325 := I'm surprised the Sith haven't done anything to try and bring in Davik. After all, everyone knows he's the crime lord who runs this planet.
23326 := People are saying someone broke into the military base. Could mean trouble for us all if the Sith decide a Tarisian citizen was involved.
23327 := Ah. There's too many people in this cantina since they added the music room at the back! I come here to relax, not to fight with crowds.
23328 := Did you hear about the big fight at the swoop races? I wasn't there, but someone told me Brejik flipped out on the podium and wouldn't pay up!
23329 := All hell broke loose, and from what I hear Brejik was killed. Heh. Serves him right for welching on his bets!
23330 := Back again? Are you just here to watch the stun duels, or is there something else I can do for you?
23331 := I see you got your feet wet in the duel ring. Not bad... you've got real talent, kid. Stick with it and you'll go places.
23332 := Pretty impressive, Stranger. Ice is no pushover. People are starting to take notice of you. They say you're the best thing to come along since Twitch stepped into the ring. 
23333 := If you're going to keep climbing the ranks, then I guess I'm next on your hit list, kid. I'm looking forward to it.
23334 := You don't waste any time, do you? Go talk to Ajuur - he'll set the match up.
23335 := Hello there, off-worlder. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Marl. I'm one of the duelists here at the cantina. I was wondering when you'd get around to talking to me.
23336 := Goodbye, stranger. Maybe we'll talk again later.
23337 := No, we've never met. It's just that most people who come here to watch the duels are bored nobles looking for a little excitement in their drab lives. But you're different.
23338 := You look like you know a thing or two about combat. I'm guessing you didn't come here to sit on the sidelines and watch a duel. Are you looking for a match?
23339 := The duels themselves are simple enough. Two combatants armed with stun pistols enter the ring. One walks out a winner, the other is carried out unconscious on a stretcher.
23340 := If you're interested in setting up a match - or if you want to place a wager - just go speak to Ajuur. He's that Hutt over in the corner. He'll make all the arrangements.
23341 := My area of expertise is pretty much limited to the dueling ring and the other combatants here at the cantina, but I'll try to answer any questions you might have.
23342 := I can only tell you what is recorded in the basic visitor guides: the Upper City is a beautiful destination where intergalactic travelers can find all their basic needs.
23343 := If you're looking for excitement the duel rings here are your best bet. Stay out of the Lower City - it's nothing but a gang ridden slum. Is there anything else you want to know?
23344 := Only what I heard from the news reports, which are all censored by the Sith. Some pods crashed into the Undercity, anyone caught harboring survivors will be arrested and executed.
23345 := Really, I don't think it's any of my business. The Sith want to call themselves rulers of Taris, it's fine by me. Just so long as they don't shut the duel ring down.
23346 := You've come to the right man. I've been dueling here for nearly twenty years and I remember every duelist who's been through this cantina.
23347 := Of course, there are only five of us left now: Duncan, Gerlon, Ice, Twitch and me. Bendak Starkiller comes in once in a while, but he's retired now.
23348 := What can I say? Bendak was a legend. Never lost a match his entire career. But he was bloodthirsty as an Iridorian battle rager - never liked having to face the same opponent twice.
23349 := Got so he wouldn't battle anyone unless it was a death match. When they made death matches illegal, he went into retirement. He still hangs around here sometimes.
23350 := Bendak's the best there ever was, plain and simple. Even now I'd bet that anyone who steps into the ring with him wouldn't make it out alive.
23351 := Me? I've seen my share of battles. My best years are gone, but I can still hold my own against anyone in here... except maybe Twitch.
23352 := Twitch? I think that Rodian is completely crazy, but he's very, very good despite his insanity. Or maybe because of it. Even I can't beat him.
23353 := Ice? Eh, she's not much for personality, but she's a hell of a fighter - confident, steady. Popular with the crowd, too. If you go up against her you know you're in for a tough match.
23354 := Gerlon used to be pretty good, before the accident. His blaster overheated during a match and exploded. One in a million occurrence. Paralyzed three fingers on his right hand.
23355 := They call him Gerlon Two-Fingers now. He hasn't been the same since the accident, but he's still out here trying to earn a living. That's why I never fight with blasters.
23356 := Duncan? Worst duelist ever. His nickname is Deadeye because he fights like he's blind! I wouldn't worry about him.
23357 := I've seen you in the dueling ring; you're serious about this. People like you scout things out, so I figured eventually you'd come to talk to me.
23358 := You're good, Stranger... maybe even as good as Bendak in his prime. There's no shame in losing to you. But when you beat me you made me realize something, kid.
23359 := First it was just Twitch I couldn't handle. Now it's you and Twitch. Pretty soon there'll be another young hotshot clawing past me in the rankings. 
23360 := This game's been good to me, but my time is done. I need to get away from the duel rings for a while, think things over. Goodbye, Stranger - I wish you all the best.
23361 := Let's step into the ring, then!
23362 := Goodbye.
23363 := Were you expecting me?
23364 := Do I know you?
23365 := Tell me more about these duels.
23366 := I want to ask you some questions.
23367 := I just want some general information on Taris.
23368 := Do you know anything about the crashed Republic escape pods?
23369 := I want to ask you about the duelists here.
23370 := I want to ask something else.
23371 := Tell me about Bendak Starkiller.
23372 := Tell me about yourself.
23373 := Tell me about Twitch.
23374 := Tell me about Ice.
23375 := Tell me about Gerlon.
23376 := Tell me about Duncan.
23377 := I'm looking for a match.
23378 := Everyone's worried the Sith will come in here and shut this place down. Can you imagine how dull it would be if we didn't have any music on Taris?
23379 := Have you heard? Someone's going to fight Bendak Starkiller in an illegal death match! I should go talk to that Hutt and try to get some tickets...
23380 := Did you hear the news? Bendak got dusted in that death match! I'll never get a chance to see something like that again. I can't believe I didn't get a ticket!
23381 := Did you hear? Bendak got dusted in that death match - by a woman, no less! Heh. Isn't that great? That should show these men a thing or two about who's the boss!
23382 := Isn't this band great? They can't leave Taris because of the Sith quarantine, so they've been playing here every night! Talk about a good break for us!
23383 := Hmph - who dresses you? You look like you crawled up here from the Lower City. Oh well, I guess we can't all have style.
23384 := Did you hear what happened after the big swoop race? They say Brejik wouldn't pay up when he lost, and a brawl broke out! I can't believe I missed it!
23385 := Everyone's worried the Sith will come in here and shut this place down. Can you imagine how dull it would be if we didn't have any music on Taris?
23386 := Have you heard? Someone's going to fight Bendak Starkiller in an illegal death match! I should go talk to that Hutt and try to get some tickets...
23387 := Did you hear the news? Bendak got dusted in that death match! I'll never get a chance to see something like that again. I can't believe I didn't get a ticket!
23388 := Did you hear? Bendak got dusted in that death match - by a woman, no less! Isn't that great? That should show these men a thing or two about who's the boss!
23389 := Hmph! I don't know what the guys in here find so attractive about those Twi'leks. Look at them - they're dressed like dirty little space wenches!
23390 := Isn't this band great? They can't leave Taris because of the Sith quarantine, so they've been playing here every night! Talk about a good break for us!
23391 := Hmph - who dresses you? You look like you crawled up here from the Lower City. Oh well, I guess we can't all have style.
23392 := Did you hear what happened after the big swoop race? They say Brejik wouldn't pay up when he lost, and a brawl broke out! I can't believe I missed it!
23393 := Well, people complain, but things under the Sith really aren't so bad. Sure, we can't leave the planet, but we're still allowed to come here and listen to the music.
23394 := Have you heard? Somebody's going to fight Bendak Starkiller in an illegal death match! Heh heh. I wonder if the old guy's still got what it takes. You figure he'd be out of practice, right?
23395 := So I heard Bendak Starkiller finally lost a death match. Can't say I'm surprised. The guy was retired for so long he probably lost his edge.
23396 := Did you hear? The great Bendak Starkiller is dead. Killed in the duel ring - by a woman! Can't say I'm surprised. The guy was retired for so long he probably lost his edge.
23397 := Check out those Twi'lek dancers. I don't know who designed their outfits, but that man deserves a raise!
23398 := The band is pretty good, but I'm getting a little sick of them. If it wasn't for the Sith quarantine maybe we could get somebody new in here to play!
23399 := Nice outfit. You steal those clothes from a bum in the Lower City? Oh well, I guess you don't have to have good taste in clothes to come and enjoy the music.
23400 := They say a brawl broke out at the swoop races this year. Sound like things are getting out of control in the Lower City... maybe the Sith should go and clean it up!
23401 := Don't bother me while I'm working... I get paid to dance, not to talk. 
23402 := You may be a big celebrity and all, but I'm trying to earn a living here!
23403 := You may be a big celebrity and all, but I'm trying to earn a living here!
23404 := Back again? Well... do you have a deck yet? Would you like to play some Pazaak?
23405 := You still don't have a deck? Then why are you bothering me? Until you get a deck from Garouk we have nothing to discuss.
23406 := I saw you getting a Pazaak lesson from that old fossil Garouk. Learning the rules of Pazaak is easy, but actually playing the game is a much greater challenge.
23407 := Normally I wouldn't bother with a novice like you, but since Gelrood was banned for hustling cards I haven't been able to find a good game around here. Do you wish to play a hand?
23408 := I'm going to enjoy relieving you of your credits almost as much as I'm going to enjoy humiliating you. Ha ha ha.
23409 := Pazaak is not for everyone - it requires both nerve and skill. Perhaps you should practice before risking your credits against such a skilled player as myself. Heh heh heh. Unless you like losing? 
23410 := Confidence is inspiring in one who has such a propensity for failure. Foolish, heh, but inspiring.
23411 := You were lucky to win the last match. But luck is no substitute for skill in Pazaak. If you are foolish enough to play me again I won't repeat the mistake of underestimating you. 
23412 := I do not lose at Pazaak very often, but you have made a habit of beating me. I think it is obvious what that means - you cheat!
23413 := You cheat me out of my hard earned credits, and you expect me to answer your questions?
23414 := I haven't been able to figure out how, but I know you're cheating. I'm simply too good to lose this often. And I refuse to play Pazaak with a cheater.
23415 := You can leave now, cheater. I won't be wasting anymore time with you.
23416 := Geez, what sore loser! I haven't seen this much whining since I gave Zaalbar that bath!
23417 := Pazaak is not for everyone - it requires both nerve and skill. Perhaps you should practice before risking your credits against such a skilled player as myself. Heh heh heh. Unless you like losing? 
23418 := Confidence is inspiring in one who has such a propensity for failure. Foolish, heh, but inspiring.
23419 := You were lucky to win the last match. But luck is no substitute for skill in Pazaak. If you are foolish enough to play me again I won't repeat the mistake of underestimating you. 
23420 := I do not lose at Pazaak very often, but you have made a habit of beating me. I think it is obvious what that means - you cheat!
23421 := You cheat me out of my hard earned credits, and you expect me to answer your questions?
23422 := I haven't been able to figure out how, but I know you're cheating. I'm simply too good to lose this often. And I refuse to play Pazaak with a cheater.
23423 := You can leave now, cheater. I won't be wasting anymore time with you.
23424 := What do you want? Have you come here just to bother me, or do you wish to test yourself against the best Pazaak player on Taris? Heh heh heh.
23425 := If you ever wish to test yourself against the best Pazaak player on Taris, heh, you know where to find me.
23426 := Goodbye, cheater.
23427 := You don't even have your own deck? Then why are you bothering me? You can't play Pazaak without your own deck!
23428 := If you're serious about Pazaak, go speak to old Garouk on the other side of the tavern. His gambling days are over, and he's looking to sell his deck.
23429 := Questions? Heh. I don't come here to answer questions. If you want to play Pazaak, let's play. If not, then quit crowding my gaming table.
23430 := My name is Niklos. I'm the unofficial champion of the Pazaak circuit here on Taris. If you don't mind losing your wager we could play a few hands.
23431 := I don't have a deck yet.
23432 := Who are you again?
23433 := Sorry, not interested right now. 
23434 := Let's play.
23435 := TEST DIALOG - Pazaak HAND LOST
23436 := Deal the cards - I'm going to wipe that smirk off your face!
23437 := TEST DIALOG - Pazaak HAND WON
23438 := You think it was luck? Let's do it again!
23439 := Don't be a sore loser. I just want to ask you some questions.
23440 := It's not my fault you're bad at Pazaak.
23441 := You can't make an accusation like that without proof!
23442 := Deal the cards - I'm going to wipe that smirk off your face!
23443 := You think it was luck? Let's do it again!
23444 := Don't be a sore loser. I just want to ask you some questions.
23445 := It's not my fault you play like a blind ronto!
23446 := You can't make an accusation like that without proof!
23447 := Goodbye.
23448 := I want to play Pazaak, but I don't have a deck.
23449 := I want to ask you some questions.
23450 := Who are you?
23451 := What? Why are you speaking to me? Can't you tell from my clothing that I'm of the nobility!
23452 := Get away from me - I can't be seen talking with the common rabble. It wouldn't be proper for a man of my standing.
23453 := Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...
23454 := First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch.
23455 := I'm off duty right now, so I'm not in uniform. My name is Sarna - junior officer first class with the Sith occupation force.
23456 := I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this job pretty lonely.
23457 := You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.
23458 := You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know we have to make the best of things?
23459 := Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!
23460 := It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.
23461 := That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.
23462 := I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party tonight to blow off some steam.
23463 := I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.
23464 := Just because I'm with the Sith doesn't mean I don't know how to have a good time. You'll enjoy yourself. I promise.
23465 := Don't be late. We're starting right after our shifts end. Most of us won't even be going back to the base to lock up our uniforms. I look forward to seeing you there.
23466 := [Success] You're right! It's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?
23467 := Oh, great... I see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you. 
23468 := Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!
23469 := I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?
23470 := Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.
23471 := [Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.
23472 := But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.
23473 := [Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.
23474 := Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with the locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.
23475 := Good. Move along and leave me alone or I might have to run you in for questioning.
23476 := Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.
23477 := Sorry, but I'm not here looking for conversation. I just came to get a drink, listen to some music and try to relax before my next shift at the military base.
23478 := I don't wear my uniform when I'm off duty. It's not allowed. In fact, anyone in uniform is banned from entering the cantina.
23479 := The officers don't even like it when we show up here off duty. Don't like us fraternizing with the locals, I guess. But it gets pretty stale hanging around the base all the time.
23480 := Besides, the Sith don't own me. Being a soldier in their fleet is just a job, you know? A job with long hours and low pay, I might add. 
23481 := When I signed up I was promised adventure and excitement in exotic locales. Instead, I end up stationed at a military base on some backwater planet on the fringes of the galaxy.
23482 := If I could just find some other way to earn some credits I could give this lousy job up. Retire my uniform, so to speak.
23483 := Oh... okay. See you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. It might not go over well with my superiors.
23484 := The senior officers don't really like it when we start answering questions, you know? They don't want us fraternizing with the locals. Just another "perk" of the job.
23485 := No offense, but I probably shouldn't be talking to you anymore. I'm just going to say something that might get me in trouble.
23486 := What? Are you offering me a bribe? You realize this is treason, right? If I report you the Sith will have you executed!
23487 := You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.
23488 := I might complain a lot, but it's a big step from complaining to treason. I think... I think maybe we should end this conversation - for both our sakes.
23489 := The truth is I find your offer rather tempting. I could probably get you some uniforms. But if we get caught we're dead. You're asking me to take an awful risk.
23490 := If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 200 credits up front if you want some uniforms. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?
23491 := Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.
23492 := [Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 200 credits or no deal.
23493 := [Success] Hmmm... 100 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.
23494 := Okay, you've got a deal. The trick is to get you the uniforms without the Sith knowing I gave them to you. But I've got a plan.
23495 := I'm going to a party with some of the other Sith soldiers tonight. You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take our uniforms.
23496 := We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.
23497 := I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party later and take the uniforms after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?
23498 := I'll probably get a reprimand for not locking it up, but that's about it. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.
23499 := Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.
23500 := I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party tonight. Just remember - if you get caught with those uniforms, I don't know you.
23501 := Hey, now - let's not start making threats. I didn't say I *would* report you, only that I could. This kind of talk is dangerous, you know? But I'm not going to turn you in.
23502 := Back at the military base, of course. I keep it there when I'm off duty. If anything happens to it they dock the cost from my pay.
23503 := Well, are you here to close our deal? 200 credits gets you access to a set of Sith uniforms. Otherwise, we really shouldn't be talking.
23504 := I'm surprised to see you again. I thought you had gotten sick of me complaining about my job at the Sith military base. I guess I kind of obsess about it. That can't be healthy.
23505 := Hey, you made it! I was beginning to wonder if you were going to show! The party's in full swing - come on in.
23506 := You have to try this Tarisian ale - it's fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!
23507 := Careful, Sarna. That wine's got quite the kick. A couple more bottles and we'll all be passed out on the floor!
23508 := Who cares? We're not on duty tomorrow - let's live a little! Come on - drink up!
23509 := I'm not interested in chatting right now.
23510 := You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.
23511 := I'm not actually from Taris. I'm just stuck here until the quarantine ends.
23512 := Being stuck on Taris isn't so bad... but the locals aren't much fun.
23513 := Everybody has their ups and downs... it's how you deal with them that counts.
23514 := You've got a pretty positive attitude.
23515 := It must be tough, being stationed on a hostile world.
23516 := You need to blow off steam once in a while.
23517 := I don't think I can make it.
23518 := Sounds good. I'll be there.
23519 := [Persuade] Hey, we're both strangers on Taris. We have to stick together.
23520 := You can't really blame people... you did conquer the planet.
23521 := You seem pretty touchy about this. Maybe you feel a little guilty about what you do.
23522 := Sorry - I'm not trying to judge you.
23523 := [Persuade] You're just doing your job, right? I don't hold that against you.
23524 := I'll be going now.
23525 := You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.
23526 := Sounds like you aren't very happy.
23527 := So why do you do it?
23528 := I'll be going now.
23529 := Can I ask you some questions?
23530 := If you help me get my hands on some uniforms I'll make it worth your while.
23531 := Hey, relax - I was just making a joke.
23532 := I don't think you'll report me. I think you've been waiting for an offer like this.
23533 := Forget it - I'm not paying that much!
23534 := I can't afford that much.
23535 := [Persuade] Make it 100 credits and we have a deal.
23536 := Sounds like a good plan.
23537 := How do I know this isn't some kind of set up?
23538 := Won't you get in trouble if I steal your uniform?
23539 := Okay - here's 200 credits.
23540 := You report me and I'll tell them how you really feel about your job.
23541 := Why aren't you in uniform now?
23542 := If you're here to complain about the quarantine don't waste your breath. There's nothing I can do about it. I just follow the orders I'm given.
23543 := Let me enjoy my drink in peace, and I won't have to run you in for questioning.
23544 := I'm not here to chat. I just finished a long shift at the military base and now I'm just looking to relax.
23545 := Taris isn't such a bad place. I've been stationed in worse places than this during my commission.
23546 := This cantina isn't the fanciest joint I've ever been in, but it's a good place to unwind after a hard shift at the military base.
23547 := This Tarisian ale is fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!
23548 := Nice outfit. I've seen Outcasts in the Undercity who dress better than you.
23549 := Have you heard? Bendak Starkiller's coming out of retirement! I almost feel bad for the blaster fodder who's going up against him.
23550 := I know you - you're the one who killed Bendak Starkiller in that death match! Too bad the quarantine has made Tarisian ale so expensive or I'd buy you a drink.
23551 := Hey - you're the Mysterious Stranger! I saw you gun down Starkiller in that death match! Guess you proved you don't have to be a man to handle a blaster.
23552 := You aren't from Taris, are you? Do yourself a favor and stay away from the Tarisian ale - it packs more kick than most off-worlders can handle.
23553 := It's a good thing a few of the Sith come in here to relax when they're off duty. That should keep them from closing this cantina down.
23554 := They're saying someone broke into the military complex! I hear the Sith are thinking about enforcing a city wide curfew to tighten security.
23555 := I wish the off duty Sith would stop coming in here for drinks. They've been scouring the Undercity looking for Republic escape pods and they reek of the sewers!
23556 := Have you heard? Bendak Starkiller's coming out of retirement! I have to get tickets for that match!
23557 := Hey - you're the Mysterious Stranger! I saw you take out Bendak. Very harsh, man! You're one stone cold killer!
23558 := Hey - you're the Mysterious Stranger! I saw you fight Bendak! There's nothing more exciting than a woman with a blaster, I say! Too bad my wife wouldn't agree...
23559 := Hey, that quarantine must be tough on you off-worlders stuck here. You should try to make the best of it and order yourself some Tarisian ale. It'll take away some of the sting. 
23560 := It's bad enough the Sith conquered this planet, but do they have to come in here to relax and rub their presence in our faces?
23561 := Did you hear? There's an underground resistance movement against the Sith! They even broke into the military compound, or so I'm hearing.
23562 := Blast away! Open fire! Shoot, kill, maim!
23563 := Shoot first! Shoot last! Party with me, we'll have a blast! 
23564 := Ready Aim Fire!! Is your trigger finger as itchy as mine?
23565 := Ready Aim Fire!! Is your trigger finger as itchy as mine?
23566 := Shoot first! Shoot last! Party with me, we'll have a blast! 
23567 := Ready Aim Fire!! Is your trigger finger as itchy as mine?
23568 := Blast away! Open fire! Shoot, kill, maim!
23569 := Blast away! Open fire! Shoot, kill, maim!
23570 := Ready Aim Fire!! Is your trigger finger as itchy as mine?
23571 := Blast away! Open fire! Shoot, kill, maim!
23572 := Shoot first! Shoot last! Party with me, we'll have a blast! 
23573 := Shoot first! Shoot last! Party with me, we'll have a blast! 
23574 := Uh... okay. Goodbye then.
23575 := Are you completely insane?
23576 := What the hell are you talking about?
23577 := Uh... okay. Goodbye then.
23578 := Are you completely insane?
23579 := What the hell are you talking about?
23580 := Uh... okay. Goodbye then.
23581 := Are you completely insane?
23582 := What the hell are you talking about?
23583 := I'm sorry. I'm too busy to talk. I have to get these drink orders to the customers!
23584 := Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...
23585 := First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch.
23586 := I'm off duty right now, so I'm not in uniform. My name is Yun Genda - junior officer first class with the Sith occupation force.
23587 := I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this a pretty lonely job.
23588 := You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.
23589 := You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?
23590 := Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!
23591 := It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.
23592 := That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.
23593 := I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party tonight to blow off some steam.
23594 := I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.
23595 := Just because I'm with the Sith doesn't mean I don't know how to have a good time. You'll enjoy yourself. I promise.
23596 := Don't be late. We're starting right after our shifts end. Most of us won't even be going back to the base to lock up our uniforms. I look forward to seeing you there.
23597 := [Success] You're right! It's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?
23598 := Oh, great... I see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you. 
23599 := Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!
23600 := I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's just keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?
23601 := Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.
23602 := [Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.
23603 := But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.
23604 := [Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.
23605 := Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with the locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.
23606 := Good. Move along and leave me alone or I might have to run you in for questioning.
23607 := Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.
23608 := Sorry, but I'm not here looking for conversation. I just came to get a drink, listen to some music and try to relax before my next shift at the military base.
23609 := I don't wear my uniform when I'm off duty. It's not allowed. In fact, anyone in uniform is banned from entering the cantina.
23610 := The officers don't like it when we show up here off duty. Don't like us fraternizing with the locals, I guess. But it gets pretty stale hanging out around the base all the time.
23611 := Besides, the Sith don't own me. Being a soldier in their fleet is just a job, you know? A job with long hours and low pay, I might add.
23612 := When I signed up I was promised adventure and excitement in exotic locales. Instead, I end up stationed at a military base on some backwater planet on the fringes of the galaxy.
23613 := If I could just find some other way to earn some credits I could give up this lousy job. Retire my uniform, so to speak.
23614 := Oh... okay. Well, see you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. Eh, might not go over well with my superiors.
23615 := The senior officers don't really like it when we start answering questions, you know? They don't want us fraternizing with the locals. Just another "perk" of the job.
23616 := No offense, but I probably shouldn't be talking to you anymore. I'm liable to say something that might get me in trouble.
23617 := What? Are you offering me a bribe? You realize this is treason, right? If I report you the Sith will have you executed!
23618 := You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.

23621 := If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 200 credits up front if you want to get inside the base. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?
23622 := Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.
23623 := [Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 200 credits or no deal.
23624 := [Success] Hmmm... 100 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.
23625 := Okay, you've got a deal. The trick is to get you the uniforms without the Sith knowing I gave them to you. But I've got a plan.
23626 := I'm going to a party with some of the other soldiers tonight. Most people are coming right after their shift, so they'll have their uniforms with them.
23627 := You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take our uniforms from the lockbox in the apartment.
23628 := We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.
23629 := I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party later and take the uniforms after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?
23630 := I'll probably get a reprimand for not locking it up, but that's about it. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.
23631 := Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.
23632 := I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party tonight. Just remember - if you get caught with those uniforms, I don't know you.
23633 := Hey, now - let's not start making threats. I didn't say I *would* report you, only that I could. This kind of talk is dangerous, you know? But I'm not going to turn you in.

23637 := Hey, you made it! I was beginning to wonder if you were going to show! The party's in full swing - come on in.
23638 := You have to try this Tarisian ale - it's fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!
23639 := Careful, Yun. That wine's got quite the kick. A couple more bottles and we'll all be passed out on the floor!
23640 := Who cares? We're not on duty tomorrow - let's live a little! Come on - drink up!
23641 := I'm not interested in chatting right now.
23642 := You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.
23643 := I'm not actually from Taris. I'm just stuck here until the quarantine ends.
23644 := Being stuck on Taris isn't so bad... but the locals aren't much fun.
23645 := Everybody has their ups and downs... it's how you deal with them that counts.
23646 := You've got a pretty positive attitude.
23647 := It must be tough, being stationed on a hostile world.
23648 := You need to blow off steam once in a while.
23649 := I don't think I can make it.
23650 := Sounds good. I'll be there.
23651 := [Persuade] Hey, we're both strangers on Taris. We have to stick together.
23652 := You can't really blame people... you did conquer the planet.
23653 := You seem pretty touchy about this. Maybe you feel a little guilty about what you do.
23654 := Sorry - I'm not trying to judge you.
23655 := [Persuade] You're just doing your job, right? I don't hold that against you.
23656 := I'll be going now.
23657 := You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.
23658 := Sounds like you aren't very happy.
23659 := So why do you do it?
23660 := I'll be going now.
23661 := Can I ask you some questions?
23662 := If you help me get my hands on some uniforms I'll make it worth your while.
23663 := Hey, relax - I was just making a joke.
23664 := I don't think you'll report me. I think you've been waiting for an offer like this.
23665 := Forget it - I'm not paying that much!
23666 := I can't afford that much.
23667 := [Persuade] Make it 100 credits and we have a deal.
23668 := Sounds like a good plan.
23669 := How do I know this isn't some kind of set up?
23670 := Won't you get in trouble if I steal your uniform?
23671 := Okay - here's 200 credits.
23672 := You report me and I'll tell them how you really feel about your job.
23673 := Where's your uniform now?
23674 := I figured you'd be back. Neither one of us is getting off this planet unless we work together.
23675 := But we've got a small problem. I haven't heard about anyone breaking into the miliarty base yet, so I know you don't have those departure codes.
23676 := If you want me to help you, you've got to bring something to the table. So until you get those codes we really don't have much to talk about.
23677 := Getting in won't be easy: the Sith base is protected by an encrypted security system. It would take a top of the line astromech droid to slice through it.
23678 := But a droid like that doesn't come cheap. Still, it might be your only chance.
23679 := That little T3 unit you got there might be good enough to get the job done. Maybe. I guess you won't know until you give it a shot.
23680 := Glad to hear it. I'll be waiting right here.
23681 := Now, I know the Sith military base had a break in. I know it was you. I know you've got those departure codes I need.
23682 := So what do you say? We join forces and I can get you inside Davik's base - and right to the Ebon Hawk. We can go right now.
23683 := Sooner or later you'll figure this out. Either we work together, or we both stay stuck here on Taris. Come back and speak to me again when you come to your senses.
23684 := I saw you in the swoop race. Very impressive. You seem like you know how to get results. That's just the kind of person I'm looking for.
23685 := Hold on just a second. Believe me, you'll want to hear this.
23686 := My name's Canderous Ordo. I work for Davik Kang and the Exchange; the hours aren't great, but they promised me a fortune to work for them and I have nothing better to do. Mandalorian mercs like me are in high demand.
23687 := But lately Davik hasn't been paying me what he promised. I don't like getting cheated, so I figure it's time for me to break the Sith quarantine and get off this backwater planet.
23688 := I've got a plan to escape Taris, but I can't do it alone. I need someone I know can get the job done to help me. That's where you come in.
23689 := I saw you win that swoop race, and I started thinking. Anyone crazy enough to race like that is probably crazy enough to break into the Sith military base. 
23690 := I need someone to steal the Sith launch codes from the base. Without those codes any ship leaving the atmosphere will be disintegrated by the Sith fleet's automated defense guns.
23691 := Here's the deal: you bring me those launch codes and I can provide the vehicle to get off the planet - Davik's flagship, the Ebon Hawk!
23692 := Damn, you're stubborn! We both want off the planet, but neither one of us can pull it off alone! Bring me the launch codes and we'll both get what we want.
23693 := Uh-uh. Not yet. First, you bring me the launch codes. Then I'll tell you the rest of my plan.
23694 := Good luck - you're going to need it. The entrance to the base is sealed up tight.
23695 := Getting in won't be easy: the Sith base is protected by an encrypted security system. It would take a top of the line astromech droid to slice through it.
23696 := Lucky for you I know just the place to get a droid like that. Davik was having one custom built by Janice Nall.
23697 := Look, I don't like working with strangers either but we don't have much choice. I can provide the ship, you can get me those codes. We need each other. 
23698 := I'm going to wait in Javyar's cantina. You come find me when you've got those launch codes and I'll make sure we both get off this rock.
23699 := Hmm. Much as I hate to say it, he's probably right. We're going to need that ship.
23700 := I don't sense any deception from him, which is surprising. This may be exactly what we need.
23701 := But that little T3 unit you got from Janice should be good enough to get the job done.
23702 := See, I put two and two together and I figured out you're the person who stole those Sith departure codes for Taris. So you're exactly the person I'm looking for.
23703 := I've got a plan to get inside Davik's base and steal his ship, the Ebon Hawk. If any ship is fast enough to break the Sith quarantine, it's that one.
23704 := But the ship alone won't get me off this rock. Without the proper launch codes the automated defense guns of the Sith fleet will disintegrate me as soon as I leave the atmosphere.
23705 := So here's the deal: we join up together. You've got the codes, and I'll get us to Davik's ship. What do you say? Do we have a deal? We can go right now.
23706 := Davik's always looking to recruit new talent. I'll tell him how you won that swoop race and mention that you're interested in working for the Exchange. 
23707 := I'll say I brought you in so he could check you out. He'll have you stay at his estate for a couple days while he runs some background checks on you - that's standard procedure.
23708 := While Davik's checking you out, we steal the Ebon Hawk and escape Taris. Come on - I've got an air speeder nearby to take us to Davik's estate. The sooner we're off Taris the better!
23709 := Well, That's... it's not a bad plan. It might just work.
23710 := This is too risky. We should find another way.
23711 := You got another plan, sister? Or are you just objecting 'cause you didn't think of it?
23712 := No, I... don't have another plan. I would rather not place my life in your hands, however.
23713 := I can say the same about you. That makes us even. Fortunately we both want to get off this rock, right?
23714 := Fair enough. But don't take too long. As soon as you're ready to get inside Davik's estate, come speak to me. The sooner we get off this rock the better.
23715 := You don't need to ally yourself with this... person. We should move on while we can.
23716 := Careful. Mercs like this haven't a lick of conscience... they'll betray you in a heartbeat. This could be a trap.
23717 := I ain't talking to you. I'm talking to your friend, aren't I?
23718 := How am I supposed to get inside the military base, again?
23719 := I'll be back when I get those codes.
23720 := Forget it, I don't trust you.
23721 := Sorry, I'm not interested.
23722 := Goodbye.
23723 := What are you talking about?
23724 := Who are you?
23725 := Why are you telling me this?
23726 := How do you plan to do that?
23727 := Why should I help you?
23728 := What's in this for me?
23729 := Sorry, not interested.
23730 := How are you going to manage that?
23731 := I'll be back when I get those codes from the military base.
23732 := How am I supposed to get inside the military base?
23733 := Forget it - I don't trust you!
23734 := Okay, Canderous - you've got a deal.
23735 := Why would I want to help you?
23736 := What kind of deal are you proposing?
23737 := Okay, let's join up. But how are we going to get me inside Davik's estate?

23835 := Well, maybe those bloody Vulkars will think twice next time before trying to keep a Jedi prisoner! And as for you, if you think you can collect me as a prize...
23836 := Wait... I don't believe this! You're... uh... you're one of the soldiers with the Republic fleet, aren't you? Yes, I'm sure of it. How did you end up racing for these swoop gangs?
23837 := You must have banked a turn too sharply, because it sounds like all the blood has rushed from your brain!
23838 := I'm Bastila Shan, a member of the Jedi Order and a fleet commander for the Republic. Nobody 'owns' me! Now we don't have time for joking around. What are you doing here? 
23839 := Save me? Is that what you were trying to accomplish by riding in that swoop race? Well, as far as rescues go this is a pretty poor example.
23840 := In case you hadn't noticed, I managed to free myself from that neural restraint collar without your help. In fact, it's more accurate to say that I saved you!
23841 := Brejik and his Vulkars would have left you for dead if I hadn't stepped into that fight. You're lucky I was here to get you out of this mess!
23842 := Yes, I suppose you can. Well, I appreciate your attempt to save me - even if it didn't really go as you planned. But let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.
23843 := If I'm going to figure out a way for us to get off this planet I need to know what kind of resources we can draw on. First, are we the only two survivors left from the Endar Spire?
23844 := The Republic, for one. I was fleet commander, remember? But I don't want you getting all worked up over nothing. So tell me - do you have a plan to get off this planet?
23845 := Carth Onasi is alive? Finally, some good news! Carth is one of the Republic's best soldiers. He's proved himself a hero a dozen times over! And he sent you here to save me?
23846 := Maybe I misjudged you. Carth wouldn't have sent you if he wasn't confident in your... abilities. Forgive me - despite my Jedi training, I still tend to act a bit rashly sometimes. 
23847 := Please, take me to Carth right away. Between the three of us I'm sure we can figure out some way to get off this planet before the Sith realize we're here.
23848 := I may have been a prisoner, but a Jedi is never helpless. Maybe you've heard of a little thing called 'the Force'?
23849 := But I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on you. You did try to save me after all, even if it didn't quite go as planned. So let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.
23850 := Well we don't have time for it now. We have to get out of here before the Sith show up to sort out this mess. Is there somewhere safe we can go? 
23851 := Never mind that. I won the swoop race, and you're my prize. I own you now!
23852 := Winning the swoop race was the only way I could save you.
23853 := We don't have time for this. Carth is waiting for us.
23854 := I didn't need your help with those Vulkars. I can handle myself!
23855 := Hey, who said you were in charge here?
23856 := I don't have a plan yet. Carth wanted to make sure you were safe first.
23857 := No - but Carth and I will figure something out!
23858 := We aren't the only survivors. Carth Onasi is alive as well.
23859 := Carth and I are already working on a plan to get off Taris.
23860 := I think you've got things confused. You were a helpless prisoner until I came along.
23861 := It's a long story.
23862 := Whoa - slow down. I'm in charge here. Remember, I saved you!
23863 := I've got somewhere safe to go. I was planning to take you there after I saved you from Brejik.
23864 := Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the winner of this year's swoop race! 
23865 := Put your hands together and show your appreciation for one of the most daring riders this swoop track has ever seen! 
23866 := Through your skill and courage you have proven yourself the premier swoop rider on Taris, and brought great glory to the Hidden Bek gang!
23867 := Now, here to present the champion's prize: Brejik Thek, leader of the Black Vulkars.
23868 := People - hear me! Before I present the so called champion of the Beks with their prize there is something you must know: the winning rider cheated!
23869 := Your swoop bike was using a prototype accelerator - clearly an unfair advantage! Because of this Hidden Bek treachery I'm withdrawing the Vulkar's share of the victory prize!
23870 := And here to present the champion's prize is the leader of the Black Vulkars himself - Brejik Thek!
23871 := I, Brejik - leader of the Black Vulkars - am honored to award the victory prize to one of my own, once again proving the Vulkars are the premier gang of Taris!
23872 := Well done - through your skill and courage you have proven yourself the premier swoop rider and brought great glory to the Black Vulkars!
23873 := That's why it is with the greatest sadness that I have to inform you of a slight change in the prize I am offering for your victory.
23874 := When you hear what I have to say you'll understand. It seems the woman I offered up as a prize is more than just a Republic officer - she's actually a Jedi! 
23875 := I've had to equip her with a neural disrupter collar to keep her mind in a state of unfocused confusion just to make sure she doesn't use her Force powers to escape.
23876 := Obviously, I can't turn her over to you - it would be far too dangerous to have a Jedi as a slave. But rest assured, I'll find some other way to compensate you for your victory.
23877 := You can't do this, Brejik! You know the rules: nobody's allowed to withdraw a victory prize after the race. It goes against all our most sacred traditions!
23878 := You old fool! Your traditions are nothing to me - I am the wave of the future! If I want to withdraw the prize and sell this woman on the slave market myself, nobody can stop me!
23879 := I might have something to say about that, Brejik!
23880 := What? Impossible! You were restrained by a neural disrupter collar! How could you possibly have summoned the will to free yourself?
23881 := You underestimate the strength of a Jedi's mind, Brejik - a mistake you won't live to regret!
23882 := Vulkars - to me! Kill this woman! Kill the swoop rider! Kill them all!
23883 := You better not be trying to cheat me, Brejik!
23884 := You're a damn liar, Brejik!
23885 := Save it, Brejik - just hand over Bastila!
23886 := You better not be trying to cheat me, Brejik!
23887 := What are you talking about?
23888 := Go away.
23889 := Hey, you not talk like that. We just want say hi to big, bad bounty hunter Calo Nord!
23890 := Nah, this can't be Calo Nord. He's supposed to be tough. This guy's nothing but a runt!
23891 := One.
23892 := One? What that mean? You be funny, tough guy?
23893 := You know who we are, Calo? We're members of the Black Vulkar gang! You don't want to be getting funny with us, tough guy.
23894 := Two.
23895 := Me no understand. One? Two? Why he count? He trying to count how many of us is against him?
23896 := It's four against one, Calo. What do you think about those odds? Well? You have something more to say?
23897 := Three.
23898 := Go away.
23899 := One.
23900 := Two.
23901 := Three.
23902 := Smart.
23903 := Come on, Calo. Let's see what you've got!
23904 := You don't scare me, Calo Nord. 
23905 := You better finish counting quick, because I'm ready to make my move now!
23906 := Come on, I'm just trying to be friendly. Don't you want to be friendly?
23907 := Okay, I see your point. I'll be off, then.
23908 := I'm not looking for a fight. I just want to talk. 
23909 := Fine, I get it. I'll leave you alone.
23910 := I saw how you mopped up those Black Vulkars. Nice work.
23911 := I'll be going now.
23912 := You can't talk to me like that! I'm one of the Sith!
23913 := You seem to be taking great interest in our progress. Do you need something, little man?
23914 := Quiet, Luugro! That's Calo Nord, the infamous bounty hunter!
23915 := There's a bounty on your little green heads. I'm here to collect.
23916 := The only way you'll collect that bounty is over our cold, dead bodies!
23917 := That's the plan. 
23918 := I figured you'd be back. Neither one of us is getting off this planet unless we work together.
23919 := But we've got a small problem. I haven't heard about anyone breaking into the miliarty base yet, so I know you don't have those departure codes.
23920 := If you want me to help you, you've got to bring something to the table. So until you get those codes we really don't have much to talk about.
23921 := Glad to hear it. I'll be waiting right here.
23922 := Now, I know the Sith military base had a break in. I know it was you. I know you've got those departure codes I need.
23923 := So what do you say? We join forces and I can get you inside Davik's base - and right to the Ebon Hawk.
23924 := Sooner or later you'll figure this out. Either we work together, or we both stay stuck here on Taris. Come back and speak to me again when you come to your senses.
23925 := I saw you in the swoop race. Very impressive. You seem like you know how to get results. That's just the kind of person I'm looking for.
23926 := Hold on just a second. Believe me, you'll want to hear this.
23927 := I'm Canderous Ordo. I work for Davik Kang and the Exchange; the hours aren't great, but they promised me a fortune to work for them. Mandalorian mercs like me are in high demand.
23928 := But lately Davik ain't paying me what he promised. I don't like getting cheated, so I figure it's time for me to break the Sith quarantine and get off this backwater planet.
23929 := I've got a plan to escape Taris, but I can't do it alone. I need someone I know can get the job done to help me. That's where you come in.
23930 := I saw you win that swoop race, and I started thinking. Anyone crazy enough to race like that is probably crazy enough to break into the Sith military base. 
23931 := I need someone to steal the Sith launch codes from the base. Without those codes any ship leaving the atmosphere will be disintegrated by the Sith fleet's auto-targeting cannons.
23932 := Here's the deal: you bring me those launch codes and I can provide the vehicle to get off the planet - Davik's flagship, the Ebon Hawk!
23933 := Uh-uh. Not yet. First, you bring me the launch codes. Then I'll tell you the rest of my plan.
23934 := Look, I don't like working with strangers either but we don't much choice. I can provide the ship, you can get me those codes. We need each other. 
23935 := I'm going to wait in Javyar's cantina. You come find me when you've got those launch codes and I'll make sure we both get off this rock.
23936 := Hmm. Much as I hate to say it, he's probably right. We're going to need that ship.
23937 := I don't sense any deception from him, which is surprising. This may be the help we need.
23938 := See, I put two and two together and I figured out you're the person who stole those Sith departure codes for Taris. So you're exactly the person I'm looking for.
23939 := I've got a plan to get inside Davik's base and steal his ship, the Ebon Hawk. If any ship is fast enough to break the Sith quarantine, that's the one.
23940 := But the ship alone won't get me off this rock. Without the proper launch codes the auto-targeting cannons of the Sith fleet will disintegrate me as soon as I leave the atmosphere.
23941 := So here's the deal - we join up together. You've got the codes, and I'll get us to Davik's ship. What do you say? Do we have a deal?
23942 := Davik's always looking to recruit new talent. I'll tell him how you won that swoop race and mention that you're interested in working for the Exchange. 
23943 := I'll say I brought you in so he could check you out. He'll have you stay at his estate for a couple days while he runs some background checks on you - that's standard procedure.
23944 := While he's doing that, we steal the Ebon Hawk and escape Taris. Come on - I've got an air speeder nearby to take us to Davik's estate. The sooner we're off Taris the better!
23945 := That's... not a bad plan. It might just work.
23946 := This is too risky. We should find another way.
23947 := You got another plan, sister? Or are you just objecting 'cause you didn't think of it?
23948 := No, I... don't have another plan. I would rather not place my life in your hands, however.
23949 := I can say the same about you. That makes us even. Fortunately we both want to get off this rock, right?
23950 := You don't need to ally yourself with this... person. We should move on while we can.
23951 := Careful. Mercs like this haven't a lick of conscience... they'll betray you in a heartbeat. This could be a trap.
23952 := I ain't talking to you. I'm talking to your friend, aren't I?
23953 := You're with the Sith, are you? Hmmm... don't think I have anything to say to you. Do us both a favor and go bother someone else.
23954 := I'll be back when I get those codes.
23955 := Forget it, I don't trust you.
23956 := Sorry, I'm not interested.
23957 := Goodbye.
23958 := What are you talking about?
23959 := Who are you?
23960 := Why are you telling me this?
23961 := How do you plan to do that?
23962 := Why should I help you?
23963 := What's in this for me?
23964 := Sorry, not interested.
23965 := I don't trust you.
23966 := How are you going to manage that?
23967 := Why would I want to help you?
23968 := What kind of deal are you proposing?
23969 := Okay, let's join up. But how are we going to get me inside Davik's estate?
23970 := You guys are behind with your payments. What do you uh, you think just 'cause you're in some gang you don't have to give Davik his cut?
23971 := I don't see Davik doing anything for his share. We do all the work. Davik claims he's part of the Exchange, so let's see him prove it.
23972 := Yeah, let's see the big crime lord come and get his money from the Black Vulkars!
23973 := Ah, so you want to play this the hard way? Haha. OK. *sharp whistle*
23974 := Oh, hey... Canderous. We didn't know you was working for Davik now. 
23975 := Yeah, we were just goofin' around here. We don't want no trouble with a Mandalorian. Here's Davik's cut.
23976 := I knew you boys would see reason. Now get out of here.
23977 := Too bad. I was looking forward to cracking some heads.
23978 := Maybe next time, Canderous. I better get this over to Davik. I'll call you if anyone else gets behind on their payments.
23979 := Those Vulkars are dumber than a Coruscant granite slug! They actually think being in that pathetic little gang of theirs makes them important. 
23980 := Gadon keeps his hidden Beks in line, but Brejik's getting dreams of grandeur. If Davik's smart, he'll slap that young punk back down.
23981 := I don't have time to stick around here, anyway. Davik's got me working on a special assignment.
23982 := Sorry, but I don't usually volunteer information to anyone who just asks.
23983 := I'm someone you don't want to get on the bad side of, and I'm not one for small talk.
23984 := Besides, you know the arrangement. You Sith don't interfere with Davik's business and you all get a nice cut of his action.
23985 := I'll be going now.
23986 := I need to ask you some questions.
23987 := Who are you?
23988 := Don't cause any trouble in Javyar's cantina. You leave your problems and your attitude at the door.
23989 := Hold on. The Sith commanders have said I can't let any of you troopers into the cantina while you're on duty.
23990 := You can come back after your shift if you want. Just remember our rule:
23991 := No? Then why are you in uniform? Sorry, but you aren't the first trooper to try and sneak in for a quick drink while out on patrol.
23992 := I'll be going now.
23993 := I'm not on duty right now.
23994 := I heard Davik's hired a Mandalorian mercenary to work for him. I didn't know there were any of them left after the Mandalore wars.
23995 := Did you hear the news? Gadon Thek is dead! I wonder what's going to happen to the Hidden Beks now?
23996 := Have you got your tickets for Bendak Starkiller's return to the duel ring? I hear it's going to be an illegal death match!
23997 := I saw Davik's new starship at the spaceport before the quarantine. They say it's the fastest ship on Taris! He calls it the Ebon Hawk. 
23998 := This gang war is getting out of hand! The Vulkars aren't just attacking the Hidden Beks anymore - they go after everyone! 
23999 := I can't wait for the big swoop race! I hear the Vulkars have a new engine that's going to break all the records!
24000 := Hey - didn't you just win the big swoop bike race in? Yeah, it was you, I'm sure! Best race I ever saw!
24001 := I can't believe Brejik tried to back out of his wager! He deserved what happened to him! 
24002 := I'm not looking for any trouble with the Sith. Please, just let me be.
24003 := I don't mind this place, but I wish it wasn't so close to the bounty office. Those guys are hired killers - I don't like it when they come in here for a drink.
24004 := This quarantine is making my life miserable! I bet Davik isn't stuck here like the rest of us - everyone says he's got a ship so fast the Sith can't catch him!
24005 := None of the Beks or Vulkars come into the cantina anymore. I guess that's one good thing about the gang war - it's not so crowded in here.
24006 := Swoop season is almost here. I hope I do better than last season - I lost a bundle betting on all the longshots!
24007 := Did you hear what happened at the swoop race? They say Brejik didn't pay up his wager, and a brawl broke out!
24008 := They say Brejik was killed in the fight! I wonder what's going to happen to the Black Vulkars now.
24009 := What... what do you want? I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just standing here... please, don't take me in for questioning!
24010 := Those bounty hunters make me nervous when they come in here. I always feel like they're trying to guess what my head would be worth if they brought it in.
24011 := I wish the Sith would lift this quarantine; I was supposed to visit my sister in the core worlds! I hear Davik has a ship that can get off the planet. 
24012 := Everyone says Zax is on Davik's payroll. Maybe I should talk to him and see what it would cost to hire out that ship.
24013 := This Cantina used to be packed every night, but since the Vulkars started shooting people in the streets the crowds have been pretty thin.
24014 := I wonder if there'll be any female riders on the swoop circuit this season. I thought about taking it up myself, but I blew my knee out in a training run. Those things are dangerous!
24015 := Hey - I saw you in the big swoop race! I'm glad someone finally gave Brejik what he deserves - the guy was nothing but a thug!
24016 := I'm not looking for any trouble with you Sith. Please, just leave me alone.
24017 := Trigger for bek base is to the left, beside this terminal.
24018 := 3ab to the left, 3ad to the right
24019 := You should get off the streets - those Black Vulkars will take a shot at anybody!
24020 := You need to get inside - the Black Vulkars are gunning down everyone they find on the streets! You should go to Javyar's cantina, you'll be safe there. 
24021 := Or if you have nowhere else to go head for the Hidden Bek base. Gadon doesn't mind non-members dropping in, and you'll be safe from the Vulkars there.
24022 := The swoop race coming up will show those Vulkars who's in charge here! When we win half the people following Brejik will desert him!
24023 := Brejik is nothing but a punk! I don't know why those Vulkars follow him - Gadon's ten times the man he is!
24024 := Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the swoop race! 
24025 := You better be careful out here. Those damn Vulkars will be looking to get even with you for winning that race and killing Brejik.
24026 := You were racing for those damn Vulkars! You'll pay for that!
24027 := You Sith don't scare me. Down here the swoop gang's are in charge and you don't have enough troops on Taris to do anything about it!
24028 := Go in and speak to Gadon if you want. Just remember to be on your best behavior... the Hidden Beks are watching you.
24029 := Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the swoop race! 
24030 := You better be careful out here. Those damn Vulkars will be looking to get even with you for winning that race and killing Brejik.
24031 := You were racing for those damn Vulkars! You'll pay for that!
24032 := Hey, you can't just walk in here! This is the Hidden Bek base. How do I know you're not a Vulkar spy sent to kill Gadon Thek?
24033 := Fair enough. But here's some free advice: get off the streets. The Black Vulkars are taking shots at anyone wandering the streets of the Lower City.
24034 := A lot of people want to go inside and speak to Gadon. He's a hero of the common folk. But the days of the Hidden Bek's open door policy are gone.
24035 := Between the Sith conquest and the Vulkar gang war Gadon has more enemies than he used to. We're being careful about who we let in now.
24036 := Well, we do need all the help we can get. And you don't look like you're with the Vulkars or the Sith.
24037 := Besides, it's not like you can do anything to harm Gadon in the heart of his own base. Not with Zaerdra watching his back.
24038 := Go in and speak to Gadon if you want. Just remember to be on your best behavior... the Hidden Beks are watching you.
24039 := [Failure] My loyalty's not for sale! I've been with the Hidden Beks for years, and I'm not going to desert Gadon now just because everyone is turning against him!
24040 := Maybe so, but this door is locked and it's going to stay that way until I'm satisfied you're no threat to Gadon or the Hidden Beks.
24041 := Sorry, but your kind aren't welcome in here. The Hidden Beks don't care much for you Sith. 
24042 := Yeah, you do that. Go back to the Upper City where your shiny uniforms will make the citizens quake in their boots.
24043 := The swoop gangs rule down here, not you! You may have conquered Upper Taris, but you don't have enough troops to sweep the whole Lower City.
24044 := You come down here in force and we'll pick you off in hit and run battles, then vanish like smoke into the back alleys and hidden tunnels where you'll never find us! 
24045 := Stick to the Upper City where people are actually scared of you; your threats don't count for much down here.
24046 := Sorry. I'll be going now.
24047 := I go wherever I want!
24048 := I need Gadon's help. I was told to speak to him.
24049 := Maybe I could be an ally against all those enemies.
24050 := [Persuade] Maybe a bribe could get me in?
24051 := I'm no spy!
24052 := I have to speak to Gadon. It's important.
24053 := I'll be going now.
24054 := Let me in or I come back with a hundred Sith troopers!
24055 := You better change your tone if you know what's good for you!
24056 := Can't talk. Swoop season starts soon. We need to scrub this place top to bottom before the season opening swoop race. 
24057 := Gotta sweep and clean. Gotta have this place sparkly-shiny for when the crowds show up.
24058 := If this place ain't spotless for the season opener Brejik will have his thugs beat me within a hair of my life! The Vulkars are taking this race very seriously.
24059 := Ain't nothing to see here right now. Come on back when they have the season opening race. That's a sight worth seein'! 
24060 := I... I don't want no trouble with you Sith. I'm just a janitor - I don't know nothing.
24061 := Every year dozens of gangs enter a rider in the race, but every year its either the Black Vulkar or the Hidden Bek rider who wins! Guess that makes sense... all the best riders belong to those two gangs. 
24062 := You got any favorites in the season opening race this year? Any inside info on which gang's got the edge? I hear the Black Vulkar's got themselves some new prototype swoop engine!
24063 := I love this place. You can still smell the exhaust from the swoop bikes! I can't wait for the season to start up.
24064 := What... what do you want? You ain't going to arrest me, are you? I don't know anything - I swear!
24065 := I don't know why teams keep letting riders come in with those experimental new swoop engines. I saw two riders killed when their engines exploded last year alone! 
24066 := You gotta be careful around here. A lot of lowlifes hang out at the swoop races. Last year someone stole a winning ticket out of my hand before I could cash it in!
24067 := With all the bad blood between the Vulkars and the Beks, I sure hope they don't pull out of the big race. No point in watching if they don't show up.
24068 := What... what do you want? You ain't going to arrest me, are you? I don't know anything - I swear!
24069 := This area is off limits because of the riot after the last race! You Tarisians couldn't handle crowd control, so we're shutting down the swoop track. Just move along!
24070 := You out on patrol? Consider yourself lucky: we're stuck standing guard over this dump to try and prevent another swoop riot!
24071 := Hey, you've already shown me your security clearance. You don't have to speak to me every time you come by. If you need to use the elevator to the Undercity just go ahead. 
24072 := Just be careful down there. Watch out for those rakghouls!
24073 := Hold on there, civilian! Only those with official Sith business are allowed into the Undercity.
24074 := Unless you've got the proper security papers you better just turn around and go back the way you came.
24075 := I'm not here to answer your questions. My orders are to guard the elevator. Now either show me the proper security papers or move along. 
24076 := You can't... not unless you're on official Sith business. And if you were, someone would already have given you the papers.
24077 := Hold on - where do you think you're going? This area is restricted to Undercity patrols! Without the proper security papers I can't let you past.
24078 := Good... I don't have time for this foolishness. Down here we run a tight ship - not like the slipshod operation in the Upper City.
24079 := You just made a big mistake!
24080 := [Failure] I don't know how they do things in the Upper City, but down here we follow our orders to the letter! Without your security papers I can't let you past. 
24081 := So just march on back to the base, talk to your commanding officer and tell him you need the security papers. Otherwise you ain't getting down.
24082 := Let me see... hmmm, these look to be in order. Okay, you can go down if you want. Can't say I envy you, though.
24083 := The Undercity is crawling with mutants. Rakghouls, they call 'em. If you see anything moving down there, shoot first and ask questions later.
24084 := I want to ask you some questions.
24085 := Where can I get these security papers?
24086 := I'll be going now.
24087 := You can't keep me out if you're dead!
24088 := [Persuade] I've got orders to join up with one of the Undercity patrols.
24089 := [Persuade] I forgot my security papers back at the base.
24090 := I've got my security papers right here.
24091 := [This door cannot be opened from the outside. You will have to find another means into the Vulkar base.]
24092 := This is Black Vulkar turf! You'll pay for this! 
24093 := Looks like we have visitors - lackeys conned by Gadon Thek into trying to steal Brejik's swoop engine accelerator, I bet!
24094 := Well I didn't go to all the trouble of acquiring this prototype just so you could steal it back for that old fool!
24095 := Would you like me to dispose of these Bek spies, Kandon?
24096 := No - hold on a second. I see you aren't wearing the Hidden Bek colors, so I'm guessing you aren't part of that feeble old man's gang. You must be a freelance mercenary. 
24097 := Instead of stealing the prototype for the Beks, why don't you come work for us? The Black Vulkars could use someone like you.
24098 := Be smart; Gadon Thek is old news! He's a blind fool in more ways than one! Brejik is a visionary - soon he'll control the entire Lower City! Don't shackle yourself to a losing team.
24099 := Brejik has grown tired of this petty war with Gadon and his pathetic followers. He needs someone to get rid of Gadon... permanently.
24100 := If you do this task for him Brejik is willing to offer a very substantial reward. How does 500 credits sound? Oh, and we'll throw in that young Republic soldier we captured, too.
24101 := Well... we can't just give the girl to you. Not after Brejik's publicly offered her up as a prize in the big swoop race. But we can do the next best thing.
24102 := Whoever wins the swoop race gets the girl. Kill Gadon and we'll give you 500 credits, sponsor you as a Vulkar rider and equip your swoop with the accelerator. You can't lose!
24103 := **Sigh** I can see there's not much chance of convincing you to come work for us after all. Most unfortunate.
24104 := Now can I kill them, Kandon?
24105 := Yes, darling. Kill them. Kill them all. 
24106 := Brejik can't withdraw his prize without losing the respect of every gang in the Lower City. Besides, she isn't even here. Brejik's keeping her somewhere safe until after the race.
24107 := Excellent. Here - you might need these for this mission. They're access codes to Gadon's private chambers in the Bek base. Without them you won't be able to get at the old man.
24108 := My guards will escort you to the main doors of our base. After you have killed Gadon return to the main doors and I will arrange for you to ride for the Vulkars in the swoop race.
24109 := I'd suggest you don't come back until the job is done, or we might think you've decided to renegotiate on our offer. The Vulkars won't consider you a friend until Gadon is dead.
24110 := Are you sure about this? I want to get Bastila back... but taking contracts to kill people is a bit much. Even if it is just more biker scum.
24111 := What? You can't betray Gadon! I won't let you!
24112 := Ah, Mission - the Hidden Bek's unofficial mascot! Your loyalty is admirable, but misplaced. Gadon only kept you around so they could laugh at you and your furry friend. 
24113 := No, that's not true! You're lying!
24114 := Am I? How long have you known Gadon? How long have you worked for him? But they never offered to make you a Hidden Bek, did they?
24115 := They... they said I was too young!
24116 := And you believed them? Come on, Mission. You're smarter than that. To Gadon and his crew you were nothing but a running joke. Weren't they always teasing you?
24117 := Well, yeah. Some of them were. But you Vulkars have tried to kill me more than once!
24118 := That's only because you were with the Hidden Beks - and because we respected you. Brejik knows you're not a joke, Mission. He made sure the Vulkars took you very, very seriously.
24119 := But... but Gadon said Brejik...
24120 := Gadon had to poison your mind against Brejik! It was the only way to keep you from seeing the truth. The Beks were mocking you, Mission. You don't need friends like that.
24121 := You're right! I don't need anyone but Zaalbar! If Gadon dies, he's only getting what's coming to him!
24122 := You're talking like Brejik didn't steal that engine, himself, to begin with!
24123 := Brejik stole that engine from Gadon! It was never yours to begin with!
24124 := I've heard the news - Gadon is dead. You have done well. Brejik himself would be here to congratulate you if he was not so busy preparing for the big swoop race.
24125 := Don't do anything foolish. If you attack me then you'll lose any chance of ever getting your hands on that girl. Besides, we had a deal, remember?
24126 := Here are the 500 credits for eliminating Gadon and, as promised, we will let you ride for the Black Vulkars in the big swoop race.
24127 := We'll provide you with a swoop bike that has the prototype accelerator installed. Your modified bike will be fast enough to beat every other racer on the track.
24128 := When you win Brejik will turn the girl over to you. You get Bastila, a Vulkar rider wins the race, and Brejik doesn't lose face for withdrawing his prize. Everybody wins.
24129 := Who will sponsor you then, the Beks? I'm sure they'd love to back the assassin who killed their beloved leader. No, I think you'll race for us - you don't have any other options.
24130 := There is one small thing you should be aware of before you race tomorrow: the prototype accelerator isn't exactly stable yet - there's a chance it might explode during the race.
24131 := That's part of the reason Brejik installed it on your bike - none of our Vulkar riders are willing to risk their lives to win the prize. They're afraid of getting blown to bits.
24132 := I'm glad to see you're being reasonable. The race is tomorrow, so I'm afraid you won't have time to practice. But nobody will be able to keep up with your modified swoop.
24133 := All you have to do is hold on tight, try not to smash into anything, and hope the accelerator doesn't explode. Simple.
24134 := Get some rest and I'll come for you in the morning to take you to the swoop track. Good luck... you're going to need it.
24135 := You've already gone to a great deal of trouble to get your hands on this Bastila. You want this Republic soldier in your possession for some reason.
24136 := I don't know why - I really don't care. But I get the feeling you're willing to risk dying on the swoop bike if that's what it takes to get her.
24137 := Explode? Are you crazy? Why would we risk riding that thing, then?
24138 := And when we win the race, we get Bastila, right?
24139 := Forget it! I know all about you Black Vulkars!
24140 := You've got my attention. What's your offer?
24141 := Brejik will let me have Bastila if I kill Gadon for him?
24142 := I thought she was being offered up as the prize in the swoop race.
24143 := How about I just kill you instead?
24144 := Forget it - I'm not going to betray Gadon!
24145 := Just give me the girl now or we have no deal.
24146 := Forget it. I want Bastila up front or no deal!
24147 := Okay, we have a deal. I'll kill Gadon for you.
24148 := Don't listen to him, Mission. He's twisting your mind!
24149 := You were about to tell me your offer, Kandon.
24150 := Gadon died screaming like a skinned ronto. So will you if you don't hand over Bastila right now!
24151 := I've done my part, now you better live up to your end of the bargain!
24152 := I've changed my mind - I'm not racing for you!
24153 := Okay, let's do this.
24154 := I guess I don't have any choice. I'll race for the Vulkars.
24155 := I'm not afraid to ride that bike!
24156 := Why do you think I'm willing to risk my life?
24157 := Why do I get the feeling you're not telling me something?

24241 := I'm not looking for any trouble and I don't have anything worth stealing. Please, just leave me alone.
24242 := You seem to be taking great interest in our progress. Do you need something, little man?
24243 := Quiet, Luugro! That's Calo Nord, the infamous bounty hunter!
24244 := There's a bounty on your little green heads. I'm here to collect.
24245 := The only way you'll collect that bounty is over our cold, dead bodies!
24246 := That's the plan. 
24247 := I heard Davik's hired a Mandalorian mercenary to work for him. I didn't know there were any of them left after the Mandalore wars.
24248 := Did you hear the news? Gadon Thek is dead! I wonder what's going to happen to the Hidden Beks now?
24249 := Have you got your tickets for Bendak Starkiller's return to the duel ring? I hear it's going to be an illegal death match!
24250 := I saw Davik's new starship at the spaceport before the quarantine. They say it's the fastest ship on Taris! He calls it the Ebon Hawk. 
24251 := This gang war is getting out of hand! The Vulkars aren't just attacking the Hidden Beks anymore - they go after everyone! 
24252 := I can't wait for the big swoop race! I hear the Vulkars have a new engine that's going to break all the records!
24253 := Hey - didn't you just win the big swoop bike race in? Yeah, it was you, I'm sure! Best race I ever saw!
24254 := I can't believe Brejik tried to back out of his wager! He deserved what happened to him! 
24255 := I'm not looking for any trouble with the Sith. Please, just let me be.
24256 := I don't mind this place, but I wish it wasn't so close to the bounty office. Those guys are hired killers - I don't like it when they come in here for a drink.
24257 := This quarantine is making my life miserable! I bet Davik isn't stuck here like the rest of us - everyone says he's got a ship so fast the Sith can't catch him!
24258 := None of the Beks or Vulkars come into the cantina anymore. I guess that's one good thing about the gang war - it's not so crowded in here.
24259 := Swoop season is almost here. I hope I do better than last season - I lost a bundle betting on all the longshots!
24260 := Did you hear what happened at the swoop race? They say Brejik didn't pay up his wager, and a brawl broke out!
24261 := They say Brejik was killed in the fight! I wonder what's going to happen to the Black Vulkars now.
24262 := What... what do you want? I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just standing here... please, don't take me in for questioning!
24263 := Those bounty hunters make me nervous when they come in here. I always feel like they're trying to guess what my head would be worth if they brought it in.
24264 := I wish the Sith would lift this quarantine; I was supposed to visit my sister in the core worlds! I hear Davik has a ship that can get off the planet. 
24265 := Everyone says Zax is on Davik's payroll. Maybe I should talk to him and see what it would cost to hire out that ship.
24266 := This Cantina used to be packed every night, but since the Vulkars started shooting people in the streets the crowds have been pretty thin.
24267 := I wonder if there'll be any female riders on the swoop circuit this season. I thought about taking it up myself, but I blew my knee out in a training run. Those things are dangerous!
24268 := Hey - I saw you in the big swoop race! I'm glad someone finally gave Brejik what he deserves - the guy was nothing but a thug!
24269 := Please, don't take me in for questioning... I don't know anything! I swear!
24270 := I gave you a chance to get out of here and leave me alone, but I guess you're just too stupid to take it.
24271 := Stop right there, or I'll give you a blaster shot right between the eyes! Now, what are you doing here?
24272 := Bad luck for you that you picked my apartment then.
24273 := You're a fool if you think you can collect the price on my head!
24274 := Now you'll see why I'm the most dangerous assassin on Taris!
24275 := Well go explore somewhere else. There's nothing interesting for you in here. This is your only warning - if you bother me again, you won't walk out of here alive!
24276 := You think I care if you're with the Sith? I've killed plenty of your kind before and I've got no problem doing it again!
24277 := No. I'm the one with the blaster pointed at you. I get to ask the questions. Now - what are you doing here?
24278 := I'm just here to rob the place.
24279 := I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Selven!
24280 := I was just exploring. I didn't know anyone was in here.
24281 := You can't talk to the Sith like that!
24282 := Who are you?

24316 := Take what you want, but do not harm me! Please, human... I only wish to be left in peace.
24317 := I'm not looking for any trouble and I don't have anything worth stealing. Please, just leave me alone.
24318 := I heard Davik's hired a Mandalorian mercenary to work for him. I didn't know there were any of them left after the Mandalore wars.
24319 := Did you hear the news? Gadon Thek is dead! I wonder what's going to happen to the Hidden Beks now?
24320 := Have you got your tickets for Bendak Starkiller's return to the duel ring? I hear it's going to be an illegal death match!
24321 := I saw Davik's new starship at the spaceport before the quarantine. They say it's the fastest ship on Taris! He calls it the Ebon Hawk. 
24322 := This gang war is getting out of hand! The Vulkars aren't just attacking the Hidden Beks anymore - they go after everyone! 
24323 := I can't wait for the big swoop race! I hear the Vulkars have a new engine that's going to break all the records!
24324 := Hey - didn't you just win the big swoop bike race in? Yeah, it was you, I'm sure! Best race I ever saw!
24325 := I can't believe Brejik tried to back out of his wager! He deserved what happened to him! 
24326 := I'm not looking for any trouble with the Sith. Please, just let me be.
24327 := I don't mind this place, but I wish it wasn't so close to the bounty office. Those guys are hired killers - I don't like it when they come in here for a drink.
24328 := This quarantine is making my life miserable! I bet Davik isn't stuck here like the rest of us - everyone says he's got a ship so fast the Sith can't catch him!
24329 := None of the Beks or Vulkars come into the cantina anymore. I guess that's one good thing about the gang war - it's not so crowded in here.
24330 := Swoop season is almost here. I hope I do better than last season - I lost a bundle betting on all the longshots!
24331 := Did you hear what happened at the swoop race? They say Brejik didn't pay up his wager, and a brawl broke out!
24332 := They say Brejik was killed in the fight! I wonder what's going to happen to the Black Vulkars now.
24333 := What... what do you want? I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just standing here... please, don't take me in for questioning!
24334 := Those bounty hunters make me nervous when they come in here. I always feel like they're trying to guess what my head would be worth if they brought it in.
24335 := I wish the Sith would lift this quarantine; I was supposed to visit my sister in the core worlds! I hear Davik has a ship that can get off the planet. 
24336 := Everyone says Zax is on Davik's payroll. Maybe I should talk to him and see what it would cost to hire out that ship.
24337 := This Cantina used to be packed every night, but since the Vulkars started shooting people in the streets the crowds have been pretty thin.
24338 := I wonder if there'll be any female riders on the swoop circuit this season. I thought about taking it up myself, but I blew my knee out in a training run. Those things are dangerous!
24339 := Hey - I saw you in the big swoop race! I'm glad someone finally gave Brejik what he deserves - the guy was nothing but a thug!
24340 := Please, don't take me in for questioning... I don't know anything! I swear!
24341 := You again? Look, there's nothing in here for you so you might as well leave.
24342 := Back again? You know I'm a man on the lam. I don't really want visitors coming and going from my hiding place.
24343 := Just be careful that nobody sees you as you leave. I don't want anyone to find out I'm hiding here.
24344 := I was afraid you wouldn't come back. Did you manage to find a permacrete detonator?
24345 := They don't usually sell them in stores here in the Lower City, but the Upper City might carry them. You might want to look there first.
24346 := I don't have any credits - all I've got is the clothes on my back. But if you help me with this, you can go to Zax in the bounty office and claim the price on my head.
24347 := You think I'm going to just let you walk out of here with the detonator that could be my ticket to salvation? You better think again, friend!
24348 := Let me see... yes, this should do the trick. There won't be anything left of this apartment but some scorching on the walls after I set this bad boy off!
24349 := Okay, the timer's set! Now let's get out of here before it blows!
24350 := Hey - you can't come in here! This is a private apartment!
24351 := Good... get out of here. Stay out of my apartment and my business!
24352 := I don't think you know who you're dealing with! I don't let criminals and thugs walk all over me!
24353 := None of your business. Just turn around and go back the way you came, if you know what's good for you.
24354 := That's it - you've pushed me too far! You shouldn't push a man on the edge!
24355 := [Failure] It's not something you want to get mixed up in. Look, do yourself a favor and just leave me alone.
24356 := [Success] I... I guess I could tell you. You'll probably find out on your own eventually, anyway. Zax is giving his bounties away like candy, or so I hear.
24357 := My name's Matrik - I used to work for the Exchange, but all the violence and killing started to get to me. I knew what I was doing was wrong, so I turned state's evidence. 
24358 := My testimony helped put some of the biggest criminals on Taris away for life. But Davik didn't like seeing his friends go down, so now he's got a bounty on my head.
24359 := Can't say I blame you. If I had it all to do again I might think twice before going up against the Exchange. I understand if you just want to leave.
24360 := Well, you're going to have to earn it!
24361 := I don't think there's much anyone could do. And I'm getting sick of running. I've decided to make my stand right here.
24362 := I've already thought of that. I even came up with a plan of how to do it. But I can't pull it off while I'm holed up in here.
24363 := The trick is getting Davik to buy it when there's no body found at the scene. If it looks like I died in a massive explosion, he won't be suspicious when my corpse never turns up.
24364 := If I had an accomplice go back and tell Davik that they were the one who set off the explosion to eliminate me, I think I'd be home free.
24365 := I have some demolitions experience from my own days in the Exchange so I could set it all up. But I'd need to get my hands on a permacrete detonator.
24366 := It wouldn't work. This goes beyond money. The Exchange wants to make an example of me. Davik won't stop until I'm dead.
24367 := Getting inside Davik's base is nearly impossible. Even if I got rid of him, the Exchange would just appoint someone to his place and I'd still have a price on my head.
24368 := I knew one of Davik's scum would find me eventually. But if I die at least I'll have a clear conscience! I wonder, can you say the same?
24369 := No, wait! I want to hear what this man means by 'clear conscience'.
24370 := That was quite the blast! Don't go back in there... the whole roof might cave in on your head. 
24371 := Look, I'm not a man for long goodbyes but I want to say 'thanks'. If it wasn't for you I'd be a dead man. But now I won't have to worry about anymore bounty hunters coming after me.
24372 := So good luck, and goodbye. Now that I'm 'dead' I can't be seen wandering the streets.
24373 := What... what are you doing here? I don't want any trouble with the Sith. Please, just go before... please, just go.
24374 := I'll be going now.
24375 := Tell me again why you're hiding here.
24376 := No, I don't have a permacrete detonator yet. 
24377 := I've got a permacrete detonator on me... but it'll cost you.
24378 := Forget it. I'll just take my detonator and go.
24379 := I think I'll just kill you and collect the bounty instead.
24380 := I have a permacrete detonator right here. Go on... take it.
24381 := Don't get upset. I'll go now.
24382 := I'm here to rob this place. Sit down and shut up and you won't get hurt.
24383 := What are you doing in here? This place looks abandoned!
24384 := I don't like your attitude!
24385 := [Persuade] Are you in some sort of trouble? Do you want to talk about it?
24386 := I don't want to get involved in this.
24387 := I think it's time for me to collect your bounty, Matrik!
24388 := Maybe there's some way I could help you out of this mess.
24389 := Maybe you could fake your own death?
24390 := Tell me your plan and I might help you out.
24391 := I could get you a permacrete detonator.
24392 := Maybe you could pay Davik off?
24393 := Maybe you could turn the tables. You know, have Davik eliminated.
24394 := I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Matrik!
24395 := I have no conscience. Time to die.
24396 := Clear conscience? What are you talking about?
24397 := This is Black Vulkar turf! You'll pay for this!

24432 := You may be a big celebrity and all, but I'm trying to earn a living here!
24433 := Davik up to something. He bring famous bounty hunter Calo Nord in for a special assignment. Calo no work cheap. 
24434 := You new here, take advice. Stay off my contracts!
24435 := New face, new face... always new face here! On my world only the strong become trackers. Here everyone is bounty hunter! 
24436 := See the price on Bendak Starkiller's head? Too bad no one will collect. Bendak never leaves the safety of that Upper City Cantina. 
24437 := I saw you kill Bendak Starkiller! I was just about to bring him in, too!
24438 := Word is somebody stole the Vulkar's prototype swoop engine! I wonder if there's a reward to bring it back?
24439 := Did you hear? Somebody killed Gadon Thek! I bet it won't be long until the Beks put out a bounty on Brejik's head in retaliation!
24440 := These are good times for bounty hunters! I've made a small fortune on the bounties Zax has been paying out. 
24441 := I saw Calo Nord in the tap room. He's a legend in this business! I wonder if he'd give me an autograph?
24442 := I'll stick with the bounties Davik puts out... they're usually less dangerous than the government funded contracts.
24443 := Since the Sith got here the average price for each bounty has gone way up! Davik's had to raise his rates just to compete! 
24444 := Somebody killed Gadon Thek! He didn't even have a bounty on his head - talk about a waste of time!
24445 := I heard Calo Nord is in town. Like there wasn't enough competition in this office already! Now we have the best bounty hunter in the system scooping our contracts!
24446 := Zax is starting to get stingy... he hasn't added a new freelance contract to the board in nearly a week!
24447 := Hey - you're the one who won that swoop race, right? Yeah, I saw the whole thing. And I thought my job was dangerous!
24448 := Go away.
24449 := Hey, you not talk like that. We just want say hi to big, bad bounty hunter Calo Nord!
24450 := Nah, this can't be Calo Nord. He's supposed to be tough. This guy's nothing but a runt!
24451 := One.
24452 := One? What that mean? You be funny, tough guy?
24453 := You know who we are, Calo? We're members of the Black Vulkar gang! You don't want to be getting funny with us, tough guy.
24454 := Two.
24455 := Me no understand. One? Two? Why he count? He trying to count how many of us is against him?
24456 := It's three against one, Calo. What do you think about those odds? Well? You have something more to say?
24457 := Three.
24458 := Go away.
24459 := One.
24460 := Two.
24461 := Three.
24462 := Smart.
24463 := Come on, Calo. Let's see what you've got!
24464 := You don't scare me, Calo Nord. 
24465 := You better finish counting quick, because I'm ready to make my move now!
24466 := Come on, I'm just trying to be friendly. Don't you want to be friendly?
24467 := Okay, I see your point. I'll be off, then.
24468 := I'm not looking for a fight. I just want to talk. 
24469 := Fine, I get it. I'll leave you alone.
24470 := I saw how you mopped up those Black Vulkars. Nice work.
24471 := I'll be going now.
24472 := I figured you'd be back. Neither one of us is getting off this planet unless we work together.
24473 := But we've got a small problem. I haven't heard about anyone breaking into the miliarty base yet, so I know you don't have those departure codes.
24474 := If you want me to help you, you've got to bring something to the table. So until you get those codes we really don't have much to talk about.
24475 := Getting in won't be easy: the Sith base is protected by an encrypted security system. It would take a top of the line astromech droid to slice through it.
24476 := Lucky for you I know just the place to get a droid like that. Davik was having one custom built by Janice Nall.
24477 := But that little T3 unit you got from Janice should be good enough to get the job done.
24478 := Glad to hear it. I'll be waiting right here.
24479 := Now, I know the Sith military base had a break in. I know it was you. I know you've got those departure codes I need.
24480 := So what do you say? We join forces and I can get you inside Davik's base - and right to the Ebon Hawk. We can go right now.
24481 := Sooner or later you'll figure this out. Either we work together, or we both stay stuck here on Taris. Come back and speak to me again when you come to your senses.
24482 := I saw you in the swoop race. Very impressive. You seem like you know how to get results. That's just the kind of person I'm looking for.
24483 := Hold on just a second. Believe me, you'll want to hear this.
24484 := My name's Canderous Ordo. I work for Davik Kang and the Exchange; the hours aren't great, but they promised me a fortune to work for them and I have nothing better to do. Mandalorian mercs like me are in high demand.
24485 := But lately Davik hasn't been paying me what he promised. I don't like getting cheated, so I figure it's time for me to break the Sith quarantine and get off this backwater planet.
24486 := I've got a plan to escape Taris, but I can't do it alone. I need someone I know can get the job done to help me. That's where you come in.
24487 := I saw you win that swoop race, and I started thinking. Anyone crazy enough to race like that is probably crazy enough to break into the Sith military base. 
24488 := I need someone to steal the Sith launch codes from the base. Without those codes any ship leaving the atmosphere will be disintegrated by the Sith fleet's automated defense guns.
24489 := Here's the deal: you bring me those launch codes and I can provide the vehicle to get off the planet - Davik's flagship, the Ebon Hawk!
24490 := Damn, you're stubborn! We both want off the planet, but neither one of us can pull it off alone! Bring me the launch codes and we'll both get what we want.
24491 := Uh-uh. Not yet. First, you bring me the launch codes. Then I'll tell you the rest of my plan.
24492 := Good luck - you're going to need it. The entrance to the base is sealed up tight.
24493 := Getting in won't be easy: the Sith base is protected by an encrypted security system. It would take a top of the line astromech droid to slice through it.
24494 := Lucky for you I know just the place to get a droid like that. Davik was having one custom built by Janice Nall.
24495 := Look, I don't like working with strangers either but we don't have much choice. I can provide the ship, you can get me those codes. We need each other. 
24496 := I'm going to wait in Javyar's cantina. You come find me when you've got those launch codes and I'll make sure we both get off this rock.
24497 := Hmm. Much as I hate to say it, he's...he's probably right. We're going to need that ship.
24498 := I don't sense any deception from him, which is surprising. This may be exactly what we need.
24499 := But that little T3 unit you got from Janice should be good enough to get the job done.
24500 := See, I put two and two together and I figured out you're the person who stole the Sith departure codes for Taris. So you're exactly the person I'm looking for.
24501 := I've got a plan to get inside Davik's base and steal his ship, the Ebon Hawk. If any ship is fast enough to break the Sith quarantine, it's that one.
24502 := But the ship alone won't get me off this rock. Without the proper launch codes the automated defense guns of the Sith fleet will disintegrate me as soon as I leave the atmosphere.
24503 := So here's the deal: we join up together. You've got the codes, and I'll get us to Davik's ship. What do you say? Do we have a deal? We can go right now.
24504 := Davik's always looking to recruit new talent. I'll tell him how you won that swoop race and mention that you're interested in working for the Exchange. 
24505 := I'll say I brought you in so he could check you out. He'll have you stay at his estate for a couple days while he runs some background checks on you - that's standard procedure.
24506 := While Davik's checking you out, we steal the Ebon Hawk and escape Taris. Come on - I've got an air speeder nearby to take us to Davik's estate. The sooner we're off Taris the better!
24507 := That's... not a bad plan. It might just work.
24508 := This is too risky. We should find another way.
24509 := You got another plan, sister? Or are you just objecting 'cause you didn't think of it?
24510 := No, I... don't have another plan. I would rather not place my life in your hands, however.
24511 := I can say the same about you. That makes us even. Fortunately we both want to get off this rock, right?
24512 := Fair enough. But don't take too long. As soon as you're ready to get inside Davik's estate, come speak to me. The sooner we get off this rock the better.
24513 := You don't need to ally yourself with this... person. We should move on while we can.
24514 := Careful. Mercs like this haven't a lick of conscience... they'll betray you in a heartbeat. This could be a trap.
24515 := I ain't talking to you. I'm talking to your friend, aren't I?
24516 := How am I supposed to get inside the military base, again?
24517 := I'll be back when I get those codes.
24518 := Forget it, I don't trust you.
24519 := Sorry, I'm not interested.
24520 := Goodbye.
24521 := What are you talking about?
24522 := Who are you?
24523 := Why are you telling me this?
24524 := How do you plan to do that?
24525 := Why should I help you?
24526 := What's in this for me?
24527 := Sorry, not interested.
24528 := How are you going to manage that?
24529 := I'll be back when I get those codes from the military base.
24530 := How am I supposed to get inside the military base?
24531 := Forget it - I don't trust you!
24532 := Okay, Canderous - I'll bring you those codes.
24533 := Why would I want to help you?
24534 := What kind of deal are you proposing?
24535 := Okay, let's join up. But how are we going to get me inside Davik's estate?
24536 := I have a few things to take care of first.
24537 := You guys are behind with your payments. You think just 'cause you're in some gang you don't have to give Davik his cut?
24538 := I don't see Davik doing anything for his share. We do all the work. Davik claims he's part of the Exchange, so let's see him prove it.
24539 := Yeah, let's see the big crime lord come and get his money from the Black Vulkars!
24540 := Ah, so you want to do this the hard way? Haha. Ok. (sharp whistle)
24541 := Oh, hey... Canderous. We didn't know you was working for Davik now. 
24542 := Yeah, we were just goofin' around here. We don't want no trouble with a Mandalorian. Here's Davik's cut.
24543 := I knew you boys would see reason. Now get out of here.
24544 := Too bad. I was looking forward to cracking some heads.
24545 := Maybe next time, Canderous. I better get this over to Davik. I'll call you if anyone else gets behind on their payments.
24546 := Back again? Is there something else I can do for you? Are you looking for some cards to augment your own Pazaak deck?
24547 := Ah, the hero of the swoop race makes an appearance to brighten our day in this dingy cantina. People all over the Lower City are talking about your glorious victory. 
24548 := I've never cared much for the swoop race myself. I guess that's why I sell Pazaak cards. You need some cards to augment your deck?
24549 := Hi there... not too many people come in here to speak to me anymore. Most prefer the fancy surroundings of the Upper City Cantina.
24550 := But nobody up there carries the kinds of Pazaak cards I sell. Are you interested in purchasing some individual cards to bolster your Pazaak deck?
24551 := Suit yourself. If you ever need to purchase some Pazaak cards to strengthen your deck just come speak to me again.
24552 := My name is Uriah. I'm the man to see if you want to get an edge over your competitors in the grand old game. You follow me?
24553 := I'm talking about Pazaak. You know - high stakes gambling. Each player brings their own deck to a Pazaak match, and the better your cards are the better your chances of winning.
24554 := I'm talking about Pazaak. You know - high stakes gambling. Each player brings their own deck to a Pazaak match, and the better your cards are the better your chances of winning.
24555 := My name is Uriah. Everybody knows I'm the man to see if you want to add some cards to your Pazaak deck. My prices are quite reasonable.
24556 := So, what do you say? Are you interested in buying some of my Pazaak cards to augment your own deck?
24557 := If you want information you should speak to Zax in the bounty office. He's Davik's unofficial earpiece. But I'll try and answer your questions as best I can.
24558 := The Undercity? You don't want to be going down there - the place is crawling with rakghouls! Do yourself a favor and forget about those escape pods. 
24559 := Besides, there's probably nothing left of those pods anyway. The Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars would have stripped anything valuable from them within hours of the crash.
24560 := The Vulkars are led by Brejik. He's tough and ruthless and maybe even a little insane. He's also determined to take control of the entire Lower City away from the Hidden Beks.
24561 := When the Hidden Beks ran things, people could walk the Lower City streets in safety. But now the Black Vulkars attack people on sight. Watch out for them.
24562 := The Beks are run by a man named Gadon Thek. They used to run things here in the Lower City and life wasn't too bad. But now the Vulkars are trying to move in. 
24563 := Don't know what I can really tell you. There's a gang war between the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars, but everybody knows about that.
24564 := I'm not stupid enough to start bad mouthing Davik Kang in this place. Not with Zax so nearby. Go to the bounty office and talk to him if you want the scoop on Davik.
24565 := You don't? Well, not much point in you looking at my inventory then. My individual cards aren't much good without the basic deck.
24566 := If you're interested in Pazaak you should go speak to Garouk in the Upper City cantina. He's looking to retire and sell his deck. Might even give you a lesson, too.
24567 := Anything else you need?
24568 := I haven't been able to restock my inventory since the Sith quarantine started. But I've still got a pretty good selection.
24569 := I'll be going now.
24570 := Who are you?
24571 := What are you talking about?
24572 := I want to ask you some questions.
24573 := Do you know anything about those Republic escape pods that crashed down in the Undercity?
24574 := Tell me about the Black Vulkars.
24575 := Tell me about the Hidden Beks.
24576 := I want some general information on the Lower City.
24577 := Tell me about Davik.
24578 := I don't have my own deck.
24579 := Show me what you have for sale.
24580 := I heard Davik's hired a Mandalorian mercenary to work for him. I didn't know there were any of them left after the Mandalore wars.
24581 := Did you hear the news? Gadon Thek is dead! I wonder what's going to happen to the Hidden Beks now?
24582 := Have you got your tickets for Bendak Starkiller's return to the duel ring? I hear it's going to be an illegal death match!
24583 := I saw Davik's new starship at the spaceport before the quarantine. They say it's the fastest ship on Taris! He calls it the Ebon Hawk. 
24584 := This gang war is getting out of hand! The Vulkars aren't just attacking the Hidden Beks anymore - they go after everyone! 
24585 := I can't wait for the big swoop race! I hear the Vulkars have a new engine that's going to break all the records!
24586 := Hey - didn't you just win the big swoop bike race in? Yeah, it was you, I'm sure! Best race I ever saw!
24587 := I can't believe Brejik tried to back out of his wager! He deserved what happened to him! 
24588 := I don't mind this place, but I wish it wasn't so close to the bounty office. Those guys are hired killers - I don't like it when they come in here for a drink.
24589 := This quarantine is making my life miserable! I bet Davik isn't stuck here like the rest of us - everyone says he's got a ship so fast the Sith can't catch him!
24590 := None of the Beks or Vulkars come into the cantina anymore. I guess that's one good thing about the gang war - it's not so crowded in here.
24591 := Swoop season is almost here. I hope I do better than last season - I lost a bundle betting on all the longshots!
24592 := Did you hear what happened at the swoop race? They say Brejik didn't pay up his wager, and a brawl broke out!
24593 := They say Brejik was killed in the fight! I wonder what's going to happen to the Black Vulkars now.
24594 := Those bounty hunters make me nervous when they come in here. I always feel like they're trying to guess what my head would be worth if they brought it in.
24595 := I wish the Sith would lift this quarantine; I was supposed to visit my sister in the core worlds! I hear Davik has a ship that can get off the planet. 
24596 := Everyone says Zax is on Davik's payroll. Maybe I should talk to him and see what it would cost to hire out that ship.
24597 := This Cantina used to be packed every night, but since the Vulkars started shooting people in the streets the crowds have been pretty thin.
24598 := I wonder if there'll be any female riders on the swoop circuit this season. I thought about taking it up myself, but I blew my knee out in a training run. Those things are dangerous!
24599 := Hey - I saw you in the big swoop race! I'm glad someone finally gave Brejik what he deserves - the guy was nothing but a thug!
24600 := Back again? Well, ever since I was banned from the Upper Cantina I've been desperate to find a good game of Pazaak. Do you want to play?
24601 := You played well in our last match, but luck just wasn't with you. Do you want to play again? I'm sure you'll do better this time.
24602 := How dare you accuse me of cheating! It's not my fault you lost - I'm just a good player with a strong deck. Maybe you just need more practice.
24603 := Or maybe you just need to buy some better cards. Go talk to Uriah over there. He can sell you some cards to improve your deck. Unless you want to play again right now?
24604 := You did well in our last match. But I think your luck may be about to run out. So, do you want to play again?
24605 := Greetings, stranger. My name is Gelrood. Are you a Pazaak player, by chance? It's so hard for me to find a match now that I've been banned from the Upper City cantina.
24606 := If you're ever looking for a match and you get tired of the posturing in the Upper Cantina, just come down here and find me. I'll play you anytime.
24607 := If you want to ask questions go talk to Zax at the bounty office. He knows everything that's happening on Taris. I'm just here to play Pazaak. So do you want to play or not?
24608 := A simple misunderstanding. Some of the other Pazaak players don't understand the finer points of the game. So what if I won fifteen matches in a row? That doesn't mean I cheat! 
24609 := There's no justice. My lucky Pazaak deck was confiscated and I was banned from the Upper Cantina! Since then I've been desperate to find a match.
24610 := You don't have a deck? Well, we can't play unless you have your own deck. Maybe you should go talk to Garouk in the Upper Cantina. 
24611 := He's looking to retire from the game, so he might sell you his deck. He'll probably even throw in a free lesson for you. Just come back and speak to me when you get your deck.
24612 := Excellent... my funds were getting somewhat low.
24613 := I think you're cheating, Gelrood!
24614 := I'll be going now.
24615 := I want to ask you some questions.
24616 := Why were you banned?
24617 := I don't have a Pazaak deck.
24618 := I'll play. 
24619 := Player Loses
24620 := Player wins.
24621 := You again? This must be the official let's all bother Holdan day. Can't you see I'm trying to watch the dancing girls?
24622 := Hey, baby - back again, I see. I guess the old Holdan charm is still working: the ladies just can't leave me alone!
24623 := This better be important - I'm trying to watch the dancing girls. You got some news about Dia or something?
24624 := Really? Huh... I guess that's it then. A real shame it had to come to this. She was a good looking gal despite her temper. Ah, well. Plenty more ladies out there for me.
24625 := If you want to collect the bounty, go talk to Zax. I gave him the credits for safe keeping. As far as I'm concerned my part in this is over.
24626 := What? I can't do that! Think how it would look. I work for Davik, I've got a certain reputation to uphold. I can't let her get away with this. There has to be payback!
24627 := Although I do feel a little guilty about all this. Dia's a good looking gal - it'd be a shame to kill her. Tell you what - I'll take 200 credits in exchange for lifting the bounty.
24628 := You can do that if you want, but I doubt she's got 200 credits. That's a lot, and she's just a working girl. But that's the breaks, right?
24629 := You're threatening me? I work for Davik Kang! If you kill me you'll be signing your own death warrant. Do us both a favor and don't waste my time with stupid threats!
24630 := [Failure] If I let her get away with it I'll look even worse! She's got to pay - either with her life, or 200 credits to buy my forgiveness.
24631 := [Failure] If I let her get away with it I'll look even worse! She's got to pay - either with her life, or 200 credits to buy my forgiveness.
24632 := [Force Persuade] I think it is time you forgave her. You are partly to blame for her behavior.
24633 := [Success] Well... maybe it's time I forgave her. I am partly to blame for what she did, I suppose. Okay, you win; Dia can live.
24634 := [Success] Well... I guess you might be right. Besides, I've noticed some of the girls around here are giving me the cold shoulder since all this started. Okay, you win; Dia can live.
24635 := Don't worry - I'll stick to my end of the bargain. I'll go tell Zax right now that the bounty is off the table.
24636 := Hey, it's like I told you before - you come up with 200 credits and I'll remove the bounty. Otherwise she's got to pay the price.
24637 := What do you mean what happened? She took her vibroblade and came after me like she was harvesting a bantha pelt!
24638 := What do you want now? This whole thing with Dia is over, so we don't have anything to discuss.
24639 := Huh? What? Oh... sorry. I didn't see you there. My attention was kind of focused on the Twi'lek dancers. Look at them waggle those head-tails!
24640 := I don't normally go for these alien girls, but I've had some bad experiences with my own species lately. Maybe it's time for a change, you know what I mean?
24641 := Fine by me. That means I get to go back to enjoying the dancing girls.
24642 := Hate to see a pretty lady leaving, but you ain't the only girl in this place. I guess I'll go back to enjoying the dancers.
24643 := I don't like the tone of your voice. I work for Davik Kang - I'm used to people treating me with respect!
24644 := I don't have to take this abuse from you! I came here to relax. Shove off and find someone else to bother - I want to watch the dancing girls.
24645 := I don't want to waste my time answering a bunch of questions... I'm here to have a few drinks, watch the dancing girls and enjoy myself. 
24646 := I've got to be mentally ready. Davik's got an assignment for me off planet as soon as the quarantine ends.
24647 := I'm one of his top couriers. Davik's always sending me off planet to deliver and bring back packages. He knows he can trust me to follow my orders to the letter.
24648 := Plus, I used to be an intergalactic customs agent so I know all the tricks they use to catch smugglers. That gives me the edge I need on my courier runs.
24649 := Davik's ship is the fastet one in the entire quadrant, but even the Ebon Hawk can't get off Taris until the quarantine is lifted. The Sith fleet has the planet surrounded.
24650 := Any ship leaving orbit without the proper access codes will be disintegrated by the Sith auto-targeting laser cannons - and those codes are locked safely away in the military base.
24651 := Davik's pretty upset about it. His smuggling operation isn't making any money, but even with his underworld connections he can't get his hands on those codes.
24652 := It's not like it's some big secret. It's kind of hard for Davik to keep a low profile when he belongs to a big intergalactic crime syndicate like the Exchange.
24653 := My name's Holdan. Maybe you've heard of me - I work for Davik Kang.
24654 := You're here about that? I guess Zax must have mentioned me to you at the bounty office. Fair enough - I don't care who takes her out, just so long as the job gets done.
24655 := I can't let her get away with what she did - that wench tried to cut me with her vibroblade!
24656 := Just kill Dia and then go talk to Zax. I gave him the credits for safekeeping. He'll pay you off when the deed is done.
24657 := Because she's crazy! She started screaming that I was making advances, and the next thing I know she's coming at me with a knife.
24658 := I admit I was drunk. Maybe I got a little fresh. But it was no big deal. She didn't have to cut me!
24659 := Hey - you weren't there. She totally over-reacted!
24660 := Yeah, sure. You were as innocent as a Jawa in a droid chop shop!
24661 := It sounds to me like the woman was defending herself.
24662 := Don't worry, honey - alien girls aren't really my thing. I'm much more interested in an attractive female of my own species.
24663 := My name's Holdan, baby. Maybe you've heard of me... I work for Davik Kang, you know.
24664 := Ugh - what a pig! He even makes Gamorreans look classy.
24665 := Dia's dead. I killed her myself.
24666 := So what happens now?
24667 := Where's my payment?
24668 := I want the bounty on Dia's head removed.
24669 := Forget it. This isn't worth my trouble.
24670 := I'll go talk to Dia and see if she can come up with the credits.
24671 := Take that bounty off Dia's head or you're a dead man!
24672 := [Persuade] If you hire someone to kill Dia it will look like you weren't man enough to do it yourself.
24673 := Here's 200 credits. Now get that bounty removed.
24674 := Tell me what happened with Dia.
24675 := I'll be going now.
24676 := I'm not really interested in your love life.
24677 := I don't care who you work for - you seem like a slimeball!
24678 := I want to ask you some questions.
24679 := You work for Davik?
24680 := Do you think Davik could get me off Taris?
24681 := You're pretty open about what you do.
24682 := Who are you?
24683 := You're the guy who put the bounty on Dia's head, right?
24684 := So how do I collect this bounty?
24685 := Why would she do that?
24686 := Sounds like maybe you got what you deserved.
24687 := Keep your hormones in check - I just want to ask some questions.
24688 := Who are you?
24689 := Say, I don't recognize you and I know pretty much everyone in the Lower City. You must be new down here. I guess that makes me and Big Z your official welcoming committee! 
24690 := It's not that strange. Most aliens can speak Basic, they just prefer to use their own language. But I grew up here on Taris so I just sort of got used to speaking the native tongue.
24691 := My name's Mission Vao and this big Wookiee is my best friend, Zaalbar. I'd offer to give you a tour, but the streets down here aren't safe. But if there's anything else you need...
24692 := You're going? Yeah, this dive is pretty boring. No action around here. Come on, Big Z, let's go.
24693 := But I haven't finished eating!
24694 := Can't you think about something besides your stomach for five minutes? Come on - we'll go see if there's anything good to eat at the Bek base.
24695 := Well, you came to the right person! If you want info on Lower Taris I'm the one to talk to! Davik, the Lower City gangs... I've even got the scoop on that bounty hunter Calo Nord!
24696 := Calo Nord's one of the most famous bounty hunters in the galaxy. He's killed more people than the Iridian Plague! I've seen him kill people just for trying to talk to him!
24697 := He hangs around Zax's bounty office, but I don't think he's looking for work there. All the postings there are small time - way beneath a bounty hunter of his caliber.
24698 := I figure Calo's been hired by Davik to do a special job for the Exchange. I'd wager a thousand credits that as soon as the quarantine ends, he'll be getting off this rock.
24699 := There's only two gangs worth worrying about here in the Lower City: the Black Vulkars and the Hidden Beks. Sometimes Zaalbar and I hang out at the Bek base.
24700 := The Beks are led by Gadon Thek - he's a good guy. Lost his sight in a swoop bike accident a few years ago, but even blind he's a great leader.
24701 := Not like that traitor Brejik! Before he took over the Vulkars he was a Hidden Bek. Gadon considered that ungrateful space slug his adopted son.
24702 := When Gadon went blind everyone figured he'd step down and appoint Brejik in his place. But Gadon figured Brejik wasn't ready yet. He wanted him to wait a few years.
24703 := But Brejik was too impatient. He left to join the Vulkars, and ever since he's been waging a war to wipe Gadon and his Beks from the face of Taris!
24704 := This gang war in the Lower City is totally the Vulkar's fault. They're the ones killing everything that moves out on the street. It's like they've gone insane.
24705 := Davik's part of the intergalactic crime syndicate, but I guess everyone knows that. But I hear he's got a new ship for his smuggling operations - the Ebon Hawk.
24706 := I don't know much about space travel, but I hear that ship's fast enough to break the Sith blockade. Of course, this is all just second hand rumor.
24707 := If Davik does have a ship, he's got it locked up in his estate. Nobody gets in there, except the people working for Davik and the Exchange.
24708 := Where would he keep it? Do you know?
24709 := We just kind of fell in together. It ain't easy on your own here in the Lower City - everyone's always looking to push you around.
24710 := When I met up with Zaalbar it seemed like a good match. I knew we could look out for each other. With my street smarts and his muscle, we make a great team.
24711 := So we noticed. Still, you seem like an odd pair.
24712 := The Black Vulkar base? You'll never get in there - they attack on sight. But if you got a problem with the Vulkars, you should go speak to the Hidden Beks.
24713 := Their base is open to anyone - I hang out there all the time. Gadon, the leader of the Hidden Beks, is a pretty good guy. He'll probably be able to help you out.
24714 := Yeah, we should be going now, too. Come on, Zaalber. This dive is boring. Maybe we can find some action in the Undercity.
24715 := I told you to leave me alone - so give me some space, Bug-eye! Your breath smells like bantha poodoo!
24716 := Little girl should not be in bar. This no place for little girl. If little girl smart, she run away home now.
24717 := Who you calling a little girl, Chuba-face?
24718 := Little girl needs lesson in manners!
24719 := Just a sec, boys. Zaalbar... a little help here? I need you to rip the legs off some insects.
24720 := Mission - I'm busy. They just brought my food!
24721 := Quit complaining... you can finish eating later. Besides, you need the exercise so get over here.
24722 := We no want trouble with Wookiee. Our problem with you, little girl!
24723 := You got a problem with me, then you got a problem with Big Z. So unless you want to take on my furry friend, I suggest you greenies hop on out of here.
24724 := Little girl lucky she has big friend.
24725 := That's weird: a Twi'lek who speaks galactic Basic!
24726 := Hey - we speak the same language!
24727 := I'll be going now.
24728 := I want to ask you some questions.
24729 := Tell me about Calo Nord.
24730 := Tell me about the Lower City gangs.
24731 := Why did Brejik leave the Hidden Beks?
24732 := Tell me about Davik.
24733 := How do a Wookiee and a Twi'lek street urchin end up as best friends?
24734 := I'm trying to find a way into the Black Vulkar base.
24735 := Thanks - I'll go see Gadon now.
24736 := Gadon's days are numbered! Won't be long now until we Vulkars wipe them Beks from the face of the Lower City!
24737 := You don't want to mess with me - I'm with the Black Vulkars!
24738 := I saw what you did to Brejik. I won't be trying anything in here, but if we ever meet out on the street you're dead!
24739 := Why are you bothering me?
24740 := Hey, relax Big Z. No need to be rude. Sorry about that, but Wookiees ain't much for conversation, you know?
24741 := Back again, human? I hope you didn't come just to chat. Davik hired me to do business and make credits, not to make small talk.
24742 := A bounty? Well, human, that is what I'm here for. Which bounty are you here to collect on?
24743 := Largo should have known better than to run. Maybe now people will learn the lesson: you owe Davik money, you pay!
24744 := Too bad. Dia was a nice girl. But she attacked Holdan, and Holdan works for Davik. That was just stupid.
24745 := So Selven's dead. All the other bounty hunters who went after her ended up dead themselves, you know. You did well, human.
24746 := So, you killed Bendak in death-match duel. Ironic, isn't it? Bendak has a bounty on him for killing people in duel, and you collect it by killing him in a death-match.
24747 := I believe you, human. I've heard reports of a rather large explosion, and some of my people saw you buying the permacrete detonator.
24748 := It's good Matrik's dead but maybe you went overboard, human. Next time use a blaster, not a bomb! Bombs are messy. But at least the job is done.
24749 := The traitor Matrik is now a dead traitor. This is a lesson for anyone thinking about turning against the Exchange.
24750 := Here - 300 credits. That's the price for all bounties.
24751 := You're not too smart, human. Smart people don't threaten agents of Davik. You don't scare me, but you just made me mad. Maybe you need learn lesson.
24752 := Maybe I just won't pay you anything for this bounty? That would teach you some respect, wouldn't it? You want to reconsider and take the 300, human?
24753 := Yes, I can, and there's nothing you can do about it. There's a security system in this building - you attack me and you'll be vaporised. Go away, human. Next time you'll know better.
24754 := [Failure] You don't bargain with me! This is my business - I set the prices, not you! You take 300 or you get nothing!
24755 := [Success] You're brave, human, to bargain with a Hutt. But I like you. Okay, 400 it is!
24756 := You do good work, human. There's lots of bounty hunters on Taris, but most are lazy. Maybe if you keep cashing in bounties they'll work harder.
24757 := I've not seen you here before, human. You are new to the bounty office, yes? My name is Zax - I'm the one in charge here.
24758 := Are you looking for work? There are many bounties available here; legal and otherwise. But they all pay quite well. 
24759 := Or are you here for information? Everyone knows I'm one of Davik's best agents... I'm the Hutt with all the answers.
24760 := Goodbye, human. You come back if you want to earn credits. Bounties pay good money. And remember to come see me if you want information.
24761 := There's two government contracts. One's an assassin named Selven, the other is Bendak Starkiller. He's a famous death-match duelist. Between them they've killed hundreds of people.
24762 := But not all the bounties are dangerous. Davik got some special contracts. One's for a girl named Dia - she attacked Holdan, one of Davik's men. Another's for a man named Largo who owes Davik money.
24763 := And then there's Matrik. He used to work for Davik, then he betrayed the Exchange and now Davik wants him dead. I'll put all this information in your datapad.
24764 := Davik works for the Exchange. They don't play games. If you don't pay your debts or you betray them or you attack them they get even. People bring Davik's bounty on themselves.
24765 := Anyway, if you don't like them you don't have to take them. Collect the other bounties - government contracts. Those people are ruthless killers. They need to be stopped.
24766 := It's simple - you find people, you kill them, you tell me, I pay you. I know everything that's going on in Taris. So if you kill one of them I'll know.
24767 := All the information is in your data-pad already, but if you don't want to look there then I guess I can fill you in. Who do you want to know more about?
24768 := Davik is very interested in this bounty. Matrik used to work for Davik. He wasn't important, but he was there a long time. He saw lots of things that it was wise to keep quiet about.
24769 := Then one day he betrayed Davik. He went to the Taris authorities and testified at trials against the Exchange. Lots of people were arrested and Davik's operations shut down for a while.
24770 := It cost Davik thousands and thousands of credits to get business back on track, and he lost lots of good people. Of course he's not about to let Matrik get away with that.
24771 := They hid Matrik for a while, but when the Sith took over they shut the witness protection program down. It's expensive, and the Sith didn't care if Matrik died.
24772 := He's nothing special, just another of Davik's private bounties. He borrowed money from Davik for his business. But things went bad and he wasn't able to pay Davik back. So he ran.
24773 := Davik doesn't like it when people who owe him money run. He put out a contract on Largo to send a message to the other merchants who owe him money.
24774 := Dia's one of Davik's private bounties. She used be a waitress in the cantina here until she had a fight with Holdan. She cut him with her vibroblade, almost killed him. That was a mistake.
24775 := Holdan works for Davik, he's not one to let her get away with that. When he was recovering in the medical bay, he put out a bounty on Dia. She's been hiding ever since.
24776 := Maybe. Doesn't really matter to me. I get the bounty from Davik's men, I don't ask questions. You can talk to Holdan if you want to know more - he's inside the cantina.
24777 := Is this a joke, human? We've already dealt with that bounty! Why are you asking about it now? It's over. Don't waste my time with old bounties!
24778 := Okay, this is the bounty office, so it's the right place to ask about bounties. What's your question?
24779 := Wait - I almost forgot. That bounty's been pulled, human. Holdan told me he doesn't want her dead anymore. Sorry, no credits for Dia.
24780 := Bendak's a government contract, but he's a legend on Taris. He started out as duelist in the Upper Cantina. He never lost, but he only fought death matches. He killed hundreds in his day.
24781 := Then death matches got banned. Duel rings switched to non-lethal combat. But Bendak wasn't ready to retire. He keep dueling on the illegal, underground circuit. He kept killing people.
24782 := Finally the government had no choice but to put a bounty out on him. But Bendak's a big folk hero, so not too many try to collect. Those who do all wind up dead, anyway.
24783 := Selven's a government bounty; she's a very dangerous woman. When she started she was just another killer working for Davik. Then she began freelancing to the highest bidder.
24784 := One day she killed six citizens in the street... and their bodyguards, too. They were all Ulgos, a powerful merchant family with many enemies. Selven was hired to kill off the whole family.
24785 := She was very good at her job. Each day, more Ulgos died. Poisoned at home, shot down in the street; guards and droids couldn't protect them. After a month there were no Ulgos left on Taris. Not one.
24786 := Okay, but this is the bounty office. This is a place of business, so what kind of business have you got?
24787 := It was never proven. But after the Ulgos were all dead, the Organa family demanded the government put out a contract on Selven. They said nobody was safe as long as Selven was still free.
24788 := But the Organa family were powerful rivals of the Ulgos. Some think they were the ones who hired Selven, then they tried to have bounty hunters kill her to keep the secret from coming out.
24789 := But Taris politics aren't your concern. You're just a bounty hunter. You kill Selven, you get the credits. That's the only important thing, right?
24790 := You don't intend on working as a bounty hunter, do you? What need could you possibly have for so many credits?
24791 := It couldn't hurt, could it? Enough credits could help grease a lot of wheels.
24792 := Getting paid to murder others is hardly justifiable. It is a path that could easily lead to the dark side.
24793 := Well, it's my experience that the targets of these bounties are usually criminals, themselves. So don't get all in a twist over it.
24794 := I'll "get in a twist" if I think it is called for, Carth. I simply suggest we should use caution if we intend to participate in this... business.
24795 := I have information, but it's not free. For a fee I'll tell you everything you want about the street gangs, Davik - other stuff, too. But first you have to come up with 100 credits.
24796 := Then we don't do business. Davik pays me to earn credits, not to answer questions. If you don't pay, then I don't talk.
24797 := Maybe you could take some bounties and earn some money? Then you could afford to pay for my information. You're happy, I'm happy, Davik gets his cut... it works out for everyone. 
24798 := [Success] This Sith quarantine makes it hard to earn credits. And Davik gets mad when his agents don't bring in enough.
24799 := Okay, give me 50 credits. But don't tell anyone I gave you a deal or everyone will want a bargain and I'll go out of business.
24800 := Good. Now that you've paid the fee you can come back and ask questions anytime. You won't have to pay again; nobody ever said I wasn't a fair Hutt. 
24801 := What do you want information on now? Gangs? Davik? Other stuff?
24802 := There are two main gangs - the Black Vulkars and the Hidden Beks. Used to be the Beks ran things, but now the Vulkars have a new leader. Brejik wants to take over for himself.
24803 := But the Vulkars are out of control now. They've sealed their base and they're shooting people in the streets. Sometimes they don't even pay Davik the money they owe him.
24804 := Things were much better with Gadon and the Beks in charge. Gadon's a smart man - he knows how to keep peace. Maybe if the Beks win this gang war things will go back to normal.
24805 := Davik's a busy man - he runs lower Taris. Before the Sith came he almost run Upper Taris, too. Extortion, slavery, smuggling; Davik controls it all.
24806 := He's part of the Exchange - a big intergalactic crime syndicate. You'd be smart to stay on his good side. Even the Sith know better than to pick a fight with Davik on Taris.
24807 := Ha-ha-ha! You can't meet Davik. Nobody meets Davik unless Davik wants to meet them. Even I only meet Davik once, long ago.
24808 := He's the king of the Lower City - he doesn't just walk around here like you or me. Davik stays in his estate and works through agents, like that big Mandalorian Canderous Ordo.
24809 := The Sith quarantine has grounded all the vehicles. Everyone wants to leave, but it's just not possible. Davik has the fastest ship in the sector, but even he can't get off the planet.
24810 := The Sith fleet is orbiting Taris, and they use auto-targeting cannons. If a ship takes off those cannons will disintegrate it instantly, unless it had broadcast the launch codes.
24811 := The Sith use launch codes when they leave the planet. If you transmit them from your ship, the auto-targeting cannons won't fire at you. Only people with the codes can leave Taris.
24812 := But the Sith keep the codes locked up safe in the military base. Nobody gets in there - too dangerous. And even if someone did get the codes, where are they going to get a ship?
24813 := No, there's no way to get off Taris. You'd need a ship, the launch codes - and even then the Sith fighters would chase you down. We're all stuck here - even Davik.
24814 := The codes were locked up in the military base, but somebody broke in recently. Maybe to steal the codes. But even if someone had the codes, how would they get a ship?
24815 := Why? You need to get shot full of blaster holes? Only the Vulkars get into the Vulkar base... unless... maybe the Hidden Beks could help you out.
24816 := You got a problem with the Vulkars, you go see Gadon Thek. He's the leader of the Hidden Beks, a rival gang. He's a smart man - maybe he can help you.
24817 := Escape pods? You shouldn't bother with them. When they crashed the Black Vulkar gang got there first and cleaned them out.
24818 := If there was anything valuable inside those crash pods it's inside the Vulkar base now.
24819 := Not officially, no. I work for the bounty office. But Davik pays me to keep my eyes open and report to him... and for me to post his bounties.
24820 := I used to have to keep our relationship secret, but since the Sith arrived nobody cares what happens in the Lower City. Davik can do whatever he wants.
24821 := But enough talk - back to business. This is the bounty office, so we should talk bounties. Or are you looking for information?
24822 := You have the rakghoul serum? It's worth 1000 credits to Davik.
24823 := You find the serum, you come see me. Davik wants the serum, and I'll pay good money to get it for him. The same price as for the bounties.
24824 := [Failure] You don't get to bargain with me! I make you an offer, and you take it or you don't. But you don't get to negotiate a new price!
24825 := Ha-ha-ha! Zelka can't pay you for the serum - he's broke! You go see Zelka. I'll be here when you come to senses and see that 1000 credits is better than no credits.
24826 := [Success] You're brave, human, to bargain with a Hutt. But I like you. Okay, 1500 it is.
24827 := Here's the credits. Davik will be very pleased when he see this. Very pleased, indeed. Now, what else do you need?
24828 := Medicine is big business. If people are sick with the rakghoul disease they need the cure. Davik can charge anything he wants and people will still pay.
24829 := What do you care? You're not sick. You give me the serum, I'll give you 1000 credits. You won't get a better deal anywhere else.
24830 := I've got a bounty I want to collect on.
24831 := You'll up that reward if you know what's good for you, Zax!
24832 := You can't talk to me like this!
24833 := [Persuade] I want 400 credits for this job.
24834 := Sorry, I just lost my head. I'll take the 300.
24835 := Thanks. Pleasure doing business with you.
24836 := I'll be going now.
24837 := Tell me about the bounties.
24838 := Davik's bounties sound more like contract killings.
24839 := How do I collect the credits for these contracts?
24840 := I want more details on the bounties you're offering.
24841 := Tell me about Matrik.
24842 := But didn't the government protect Matrik after the trials?
24843 := Tell me about this merchant Largo.
24844 := Tell me about this girl Dia.
24845 := I get the feeling there's more to this story.
24846 := I have more questions about the bounties.
24847 := Tell me about Bendak Starkiller.
24848 := Tell me about the assassin Selven.
24849 := I want to ask you something else.
24850 := I want to ask you about one of the other bounties.
24851 := Did they ever find out who hired Selven to kill them all?
24852 := I need some information.
24853 := I'm not going to pay just to ask you some questions.
24854 := I can't afford that much.
24855 := [Persuade] That seems a little high just for information. I'll give you 50 credits.
24856 := Here's 100 credits.
24857 := Tell me about the Lower City gangs.
24858 := Tell me about Davik.
24859 := I want to meet Davik.
24860 := Is there some way I can get off this planet?
24861 := I want information on something else.
24862 := Codes? What codes?
24863 := I need to get inside the Black Vulkar base.
24864 := Tell me about those escape pods that crashed into the Undercity.
24865 := You work for Davik?
24866 := You don't try to hide the fact that Davik has you on his payroll?
24867 := Davik posts bounties in a government office? Is that even legal?
24868 := Gurney said I should speak to you about the rakghoul serum.
24869 := I don't have the serum.
24870 := [Persuade] I've got the serum, but I want 1500 credits for it!
24871 := Forget it. I'll just give the serum to Zelka.
24872 := Here's the serum. Give me the 1000 credits.
24873 := Why does Davik want the serum so badly?
24874 := Davik plans to prey on the sick? That's monstrous!

24912 := I can't talk right now. I need to prepare myself if I want to end up in the winner's circle.
24913 := You didn't look too bad out there, rookie. I'm not saying you looked good, mind you... only that you didn't look bad.
24914 := I've never understood why so many of you new riders make your first competitive start in the biggest race of the year.
24915 := That accelerator Gadon slapped on your swoop will help, but I just don't think that will be enough. Plus there's always the chance it will explode during your run.
24916 := You don't stand a chance against the more experienced riders. But if the Vulkars want to throw away one of their entries on you, that's fine by me.
24917 := Not too many riders can post a time as low as you did, rookie. Too bad it didn't stand up.
24918 := Normally I can match Redros run for run, but he had the race of his life today. If anyone's going to beat him it's going to have to be you and that prototype accelerator.
24919 := When will you Vulkars learn that I'm the best swoop rider on Taris? None of you has a chance against me.
24920 := Back again, I see. So, are you ready to hit the track? Not literally, of course. We've already lost one rider that way today.
24921 := You're here to race, right? Okay, let's see who your sponsor is...
24922 := Ah, you're riding for the Hidden Beks I see. Always liked them... I hope they can show these Vulkars a thing or two. But I digress.
24923 := Okay, you're registered now. Good luck, and try not to get yourself killed. We've only lost one rider today and we want to keep it that way. Whenever you're ready you can hit the track.
24924 := Okay. Just come back and see me when you're ready to hit the track.
24925 := Same as usual - he was pushing himself beyond his limits and he hit some debris on the track. The deflectors kept him from crashing, but the force of the impact jarred him from his swoop.
24926 := Don't worry... they scraped what was left of him off the track already. Just remember to hang on and you should be okay. You can hit the track whenever you're ready.
24927 := Well, Anglu has the best time so far: <CUSTOM30>. Good, but not the best I've ever seen. I don't know if it will stand up.
24928 := Well, Redros has the best time so far: <CUSTOM30> Good, but not the best I've ever seen. I don't know if it will stand up.
24929 := Okay, let's get you out on the track.
24930 := You win. Go talk to your mechanic.
24931 := You lose. Go talk to your mechanic.
24932 := Ah, you're riding for the Black Vulkars I see. Used to be nobody could challenge the Hidden Beks at this race, but now you Vulkars are the team to beat.
24933 := I need to take care of something first.
24934 := What happened to the rider you lost?
24935 := What's the time to beat?
24936 := I want to race one of my heats.
24937 := PICK HERE TO WIN
24938 := PICK HERE TO LOSE
24939 := Well, maybe those bloody Vulkars will think twice next time before trying to keep a Jedi prisoner! And as for you, if you think you can collect me as a prize...
24940 := Wait... I don't believe this! You're... you're one of the soldiers with the Republic fleet, aren't you? Yes, I'm sure of it. How did you end up racing for these swoop gangs?
24941 := You must have banked a turn too sharply, because it sounds like all the blood has rushed from your brain!
24942 := I'm Bastila Shan, a member of the Jedi Order and a fleet commander for the Republic. Nobody 'owns' me! Now we don't have time for joking around. What are you doing here? 
24943 := Save me? Is that what you were trying to accomplish by riding in that swoop race? Well, as far as rescues go this is a pretty poor example.
24944 := In case you hadn't noticed, I managed to free myself from that neural restraint collar without your help. In fact, it's more accurate to say that I saved you!
24945 := Brejik and his Vulkars would have left you for dead if I hadn't stepped into that fight. You're lucky I was here to get you out of this mess!
24946 := Yes, I suppose you can. Well, I appreciate your attempt to save me - even if it didn't really go as you planned. But let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.
24947 := If I'm going to figure out a way for us to get off this planet I need to know what kind of resources we can draw on. First, are we the only two survivors left from the Endar Spire?
24948 := The Republic, for one. I was fleet commander, remember? But I don't want you getting all worked up over nothing. So tell me - do you have a plan to get off this planet?
24949 := Carth Onasi is alive? Finally, some good news! Carth is one of the Republic's best soldiers. He's proved himself a hero a dozen times over! And he sent you here to save me?
24950 := Maybe I misjudged you. Carth wouldn't have sent you if he wasn't confident in your... abilities. Forgive me - despite my Jedi training, I still tend to act a bit rashly sometimes. 
24951 := Please, take me to Carth right away. Between the three of us I'm sure we can figure out some way to get off this planet before the Sith realize we're here.
24952 := I may have been a prisoner, but a Jedi is never helpless. Maybe you've heard of a little thing called 'the Force'?
24953 := But I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on you. You did try to save me after all, even if it didn't go quite as planned. So let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.
24954 := Well we don't have time for it now. We have to get out of here before the Sith show up to sort out this mess. Is there somewhere safe we can go? 
24955 := Never mind that. I won the swoop race, and you're my prize. I own you now!
24956 := Winning the swoop race was the only way I could save you.
24957 := We don't have time for this. Carth is waiting for us.
24958 := I didn't need your help with those Vulkars. I can handle myself!
24959 := Hey, who said you were in charge here?
24960 := I don't have a plan yet. Carth wanted to make sure you were safe first.
24961 := No - but Carth and I will figure something out!
24962 := We aren't the only survivors. Carth Onasi is alive as well.
24963 := Carth and I are already working on a plan to get off Taris.
24964 := I think you've got things confused. You were a helpless prisoner until I came along.
24965 := It's a long story.
24966 := Whoa - slow down. I'm in charge here. Remember, I saved you!
24967 := I've got somewhere safe to go. I was planning to take you there after I saved you from Brejik.
24968 := Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the winner of this year's swoop race! 
24969 := Put your hands together and show your appreciation for one of the most daring riders this swoop track has ever seen! 
24970 := Through your skill and courage you have proven yourself the premier swoop rider on Taris, and brought great glory to the Hidden Bek gang!
24971 := Now, here to present the champion's prize: Brejik, leader of the Black Vulkars.
24972 := People - hear me! Before I present the so called champion of the Beks with their prize there is something you must know: the winning rider cheated!
24973 := Your swoop bike was using a prototype accelerator - clearly an unfair advantage! Because of this Hidden Bek treachery I'm withdrawing the Vulkar's share of the victory prize!
24974 := And here to present the champion's prize is the leader of the Black Vulkars himself - Brejik!
24975 := I, Brejik - leader of the Black Vulkars - am honored to award the victory prize to one of my own, once again proving the Vulkars are the premier gang of Taris!
24976 := Well done - through your skill and courage you have proven yourself the premier swoop rider and brought great glory to the Black Vulkars!
24977 := That's why it is with the greatest sadness that I have to inform you of a slight change in the prize I am offering for your victory.
24978 := When you hear what I have to say you'll understand. It seems the woman I offered up as a prize is more than just a Republic officer - she's actually a Jedi! 
24979 := I've had to equip her with a neural disruptor collar to keep her mind in a state of unfocused confusion just to make sure she doesn't use her Force powers to escape.
24980 := Obviously, I can't turn her over to you - it would be far too dangerous to have a Jedi as a slave. But rest assured, I'll find some other way to compensate you for your victory.
24981 := You can't do this, Brejik! You know the rules: nobody's allowed to withdraw a victory prize after the race. It goes against all our most sacred traditions!
24982 := You old fool! Your traditions are nothing to me - I am the wave of the future! If I want to withdraw the prize and sell this woman on the slave market myself, nobody can stop me!
24983 := I might have something to say about that, Brejik!
24984 := What? Impossible! You were restrained by a neural disruptor! How could you have possibly summoned the will to free yourself?
24985 := You underestimate the strength of a Jedi's mind, Brejik - a mistake you won't live to regret!
24986 := Vulkars - to me! Kill this woman! Kill the swoop rider! Kill them all!
24987 := You better not be trying to cheat me, Brejik!
24988 := You're a damn liar, Brejik!
24989 := Save it, Brejik - just hand over Bastila!
24990 := You better not be trying to cheat me, Brejik!
24991 := What are you talking about?
24992 := Don't bother me... I've got to stay focused if I want to compete with the likes of Anglu and Redros.
24993 := Well, you didn't get yourself killed out there rookie, but your time isn't going to get you into the winner's circle.
24994 := Hey, look at this: fresh meat on the track. Well don't get your hopes up, rookie... no first year rider has ever won the swoop racing season opener.
24995 := Gadon must be getting desperate if he's grabbing first timers off the street. When we Vulkars win this year, it'll be over for you Hidden Beks!
24996 := Your might have an edge because of that prototype accelerator Kandon gave you, but it won't help if it blows up while you're out on the track.
24997 := I've got to to give you credit... you put in a solid run, rookie. There's no way I could match your times.
24998 := But you can't compete with Redros. He's the best rider we've got. He's a lock to win the champion's prize with the race he just ran!
24999 := But Anglu's knocked you off the leaderboard. The Beks are going to win this thing unless you get out there and beat her time with that souped up swoop of yours.
25000 := What are you doing back here? You need to speak to the race announcer and get out on the track. The longer you wait the worse your nerves are going to get.
25001 := Sure, no problem. Avoid the obstacles on the track by veering your swoop left or right. Any rocks or debris you hit will slow you down.
25002 := Every time your swoop passes over one of the accelerator pads you'll get a boost of speed, so try to hit them. And remember to switch gears when you see your engine revs climbing.
25003 := Good to hear. Go talk to the race announcer and he'll get you out on the track.
25004 := I see you struggling out there and it isn't pretty, but don't you worry. I've got a trick or two up my sleeve. You're in good hands with me. 
25005 := I made a few modifications to that accelerator. I rerouted the power from the cooling system to give an extra boost to your swoop's speed.
25006 := But cranking the speed made the accelerator even more unstable than it used to be. In other words, you're either going to win this race or go out in a blaze of flaming glory.
25007 := I don't think you'll back out now. Word is you've got an unhealthy interest in that female Republic officer Brejik's offering as a prize.
25008 := The only way you'll get her is if you put up the best time. So quit sulking and start racing like you mean it!
25009 := That's what I like to hear! Just remember, this is your last chance. That accelerator won't hold together for another race.... we'll be lucky if it doesn't explode in this one!
25010 := But don't you go worrying about that. You just stay focused on that finish line. Good luck... we're counting on you.
25011 := Look, we're running out of time. That accelerator's one step away from being scrap metal. You've got to take some risks if you want to collect the champion's prize! 
25012 := I really thought that last race was going to be the one, but looks like you'll have to go out again. But you better get the job done soon... that accelerator isn't doing too well.
25013 := It's still running with full power, but it's running way too hot for my liking. I've tried to rig up a cooling system to hold it together for another run or two. Beyond that though...
25014 := I'm not trying to put any extra pressure on you, but my gang's got a lot riding on this race. So bear down, focus and go get that time we need!
25015 := Good run, good run. You didn't post the top time, but that's okay. I checked out your swoop and you should be okay for a few more runs at least.
25016 := Remember, avoid the obstacles, hit the accelerator plates on the track and switch gears when the engine revs get high.
25017 := Don't worry... you'll get that top time yet! I know you won't let us down. Now get back out on that track and shows these punks how to ride!
25018 := Okay, not too bad for your first ever race. You didn't get the time you needed, but for a rookie you did pretty well.
25019 := That prototype accelerator held up okay, too. It's running a little hot, but nothing to worry about. Not yet, anyway.
25020 := Now that you've got a race under your belt you should be able to blow the field away. Good luck... we're counting on you.
25021 := You did it! You did it! In twenty years I've never seen anybody handle a swoop like that before! Nobody's going to beat that time - nobody!
25022 := I guess Gadon knew what he was doing he picked you to ride for us. Now the only thing is to wait for the time to become official and go collect your prize.
25023 := I guess Kandon knew what he was doing he picked you to ride for us. Now the only thing is to wait for the time to become official and go collect your prize.
25024 := You did it - you got the top time! You just beat racers who've been doing this for twenty years! This is amazing!
25025 := Someone who's never ridden a swoop before today comes in here and... wait a minute. I don't believe this - look at the board!
25026 := One of the Vulkars just beat your time! Who... ah, it was Redros. I should have known.
25027 := That's okay, the day ain't over yet and the accelerator's still holding together. You just have to get out there again and show them how it's done.
25028 := One of the Beks just beat your time! Who... ah, it was Anglu. I should have known.
25029 := So you're the one who's going to ride this swoop bike, eh? Don't worry - I've been working on the accelerator and stability won't be a problem. I hope.
25030 := Gadon mentioned that you've never done this before. You want me to run over the basics of handling a swoop bike for you?
25031 := Hold on... I better explain the rules to you. Each rider goes out on the track alone. At the end of the day, whoever posted the fastest time is the winner.
25032 := Normally a rider can run as many heats as they want, but I don't know how long the prototype accelerator on your swoop will hold up. No more than four or five races, I'd guess.
25033 := So make your runs count. Remember, the Vulkars are counting on you. If we win this race half of Gadon's crew will join us and the Beks will be finished!
25034 := So make your runs count. Gadon's put his trust in you... we need to win this race or Brejik's Vulkars will get a whole bunch of new recruits. If that happens we're finished.
25035 := Sounds like you're ready. Go talk to the race announcer over by the counter. He'll give you the time to beat and get you out on the course.
25036 := I'll be waiting for you here after the run so I can make any tweaks or repairs to your swoop in case you want to go out for another heat.
25037 := Good luck. And don't worry about the prototype overheating and exploding while you're out on the track. That *probably* won't happen.
25038 := It's pretty simple, really. First, try not to crash into anything. There's debris and obstacles scattered all over the course, so watch out. 
25039 := All swoops are equipped with dynamic deflector systems, so hitting an obstacle won't cause you to crash. But it will shake you up a bit and slow you down.
25040 := The track also has accelerator panels built into its surface. If you fly over one it'll give your swoop a boost of speed, so try to hit 'em when you see 'em.
25041 := When the engine starts running hot you'll get a warning and you'll have to switch gears. Other than that just try to hang on. You'll be fine.
25042 := Kandon mentioned that you've never done this before. You want me to run over the basics of handling a swoop bike for you?
25043 := Can you explain how the swoop bike works again?
25044 := Can you explain that one more time?
25045 := Okay, I'm ready to ride now.
25046 := Nerves? I'm not scared!
25047 := Forget it... I'm not racing anymore.
25048 := Don't worry... I'll win this thing!
25049 := I don't want to die out on the track!
25050 := Forget it. Let's just get to the racing!
25051 := How do we get the race started?
25052 := I won't let you down.
25053 := Sure, tell me how it's done.
25054 := Okay, let's start the race!
25055 := Could you go over that again?
25056 := Anglu and Redros are the best riders out here, but with a little luck I think I can beat them this year.
25057 := I saw you out on the track. You're going to have to do better than that if you want to collect the champion's prize.
25058 := Watch yourself out on the track, rookie. Every year we lose a couple of you first timers.
25059 := We Beks are losing enough members as it is without having them die on the track. Just be careful... and good luck.
25060 := It'd be a real shame if the Vulkars lost their newest rider because of one careless mistake. Yeah, that'd be a real shame.
25061 := You're pretty good, rookie. That was an impressive time you ran there.
25062 := It might have stood up if it wasn't for Redros running the race of his life. Now we're all counting on you to get out there and beat his new time. You can't let the Vulkars win!
25063 := But Anglu's better than any of you Vulkar riders. That last time she posted is going to win this thing for the Beks!
25064 := You again? Look, I plan on winning this thing so I can't be wasting my time talking to some rookie!
25065 := I figured you weren't nothing special, rookie. And after watching your last run I see I was right.
25066 := Another rookie on the track, eh? Give you punks a helmet and a swoop bike and suddenly you all figure you're racers.
25067 := But judging by the look of you I'd say I don't have much to worry about. The Beks are really scraping the bottom of the barrel now.
25068 := But the only reason you're here is because I passed on that prototype accelerator. It's too unstable, and you can't collect the champion's prize if you're dead!
25069 := You had an impressive run there, rookie. But it wasn't good enough, was it?
25070 := I'm twice the rider you'll ever be, rookie! You can go out there for another run if you want, but why bother? You'll never match the time I posted!
25071 := Anglu's already got you beat. It takes more than a souped up swoop bike to make a champion, so I guess I'm going to have to win this thing for Vulkars!
25072 := Anglu
25073 := Bastila
25074 := Brejik
25075 := Doba
25076 := Mechanic

25088 := What do you want, n00b?
25089 := h4kz0rz away!
25090 := You will r0XX0rz with this stuff.
25091 := You are now l33t!
25092 := Change game states.
25093 := Set state to looking for Mission.
25094 := Give me equipment!
25095 := Give me one of the Promised Land Journals
25096 := Give me Apprentice's Journal
25097 := Give me the passcard for the Sith Base.
25098 := Give me the rakghoul serum.
25099 := Give me 10000 credits.
25100 := Wait - don't kill me! I surrender! I surrender!
25101 := What - but I surrendered! Damn you!
25102 := Yeah - sure! Whatever you say!
25103 := I work for Brejik, head of the Black Vulkar gang. He told us to kill anyone who came snooping around.
25104 := You don't have to tell me twice - I'm outta here!
25105 := There was one survivor - a female Republic officer. Bastila or something like that. Brejik took her back to Black Vulkar base as his prisoner.
25106 := You can't. Nobody can. They'll shoot you on sight. Even I couldn't get you in - they'd just shoot us both if we show up there together.
25107 := [Failure] Forget it - nobody can get inside the Vulkar base. It's impossible.
25108 := [Success] Well, you could talk to the Hidden Beks. They're our biggest rival - they might know some way to get in.
25109 := Look - that's all I know, I swear. Please, just let me go and I promise you'll never see me again.
25110 := Sorry - I don't take prisoners!
25111 := You better answer my questions if you want to live!
25112 := Why did you attack me?
25113 := Who do you work for?
25114 := Time for you to die!
25115 := Okay, get out of here before I change my mind.
25116 := Were there any survivors at this crash site?
25117 := How can I get inside the Black Vulkar base?
25118 := You're no good to me then. Time to die!
25119 := [Persuade] There has to be some way in!
25120 := It's too risky to let you live. I'll just kill you instead.
25121 := Damn! I told Davik this salvage mission was a bad idea! His men aren't trained for this kind of thing, and I can't babysit them all!
25122 := Okay, boys... we're getting out of here before I lose anyone else. I can't carry all this salvage back by myself!
25123 := You'd be smart to get out of here as well. Even if you can handle the rakghouls I doubt there's anything worth finding anymore. 
25124 := Normally I'd make you regret those words, but I'm not wasting another minute down here. I'm responsible for this whole company, and they won't survive down here much longer.
25125 := Come on boys... let's move out!
25126 := I think you're a fool to stay down here, but you did help us out in the battle with those rakghouls. I guess I could give you a little tip to make your life easier.
25127 := Davik had us looking for two escape pods. According to our info, one crashed just to the west of here and the other is somewhere to the northeast.
25128 := You might be able to find something worthwhile inside one of them. As for me, I'm getting back to the surface before I lose my whole company.
25129 := Davik sent me down here with this motley crew to scavenge whatever we could from the Republic escape pods that crashed during the recent battle overhead.
25130 := But the Lower City gangs got here first. Anything worthwhile in those Republic pods is probably in their hands now. Davik won't like that.
25131 := This isn't really the place to have these kind of conversations. But I guess I could spare a couple seconds for you - after all, you did help us out with those rakghouls.
25132 := The Lower City is overrun with gangs, but the two most important ones are the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars. Used to be the Beks were the big dog and kept the others in line.
25133 := But lately the Black Vulkars are moving in on Bek turf and challenging them for control. The Vulkars are even starting to defy Davik!
25134 := Take these escape pods, for example. Everyone knew Davik would want first crack at them, but I know for a fact those damn Vulkars have already sent their own salvage party down here.
25135 := What are you, an off-worlder? Everybody knows Davik. He's a member of the Exchange. You know - the interstellar crime syndicate.
25136 := Smuggling, gambling, extortion - Davik controls it all here on Taris. That's why I'm working for him. But lately the Lower City gangs have been giving my boss some trouble.
25137 :=  
25138 := Don't... don't move! I'm... I'm not afraid to use this blaster if I have to!
25139 := Settle down, kid. We've already lost enough men to those damn rakghouls! The last thing we need now is more casualties from a needless firefight.
25140 := Hm... by looks of you I'd say you're down here for the same reason we are: to salvage something from those downed Republic space pods. 
25141 := Let me give you some advice: forget about it. Do yourself a favor and just head back the way you came.
25142 := Trying to pick a fight with a Mandalorian - I can see you're not too bright. But I'm on a mission for Davik, so I don't have time for fun and games.
25143 := That's Canderous Ordo! He's the most famous Mandalorian mercenary in this sector of the galaxy!
25144 := This isn't a good place to stand around chatting. The Undercity is crawling with rakghouls. I've already lost half a dozen men to those monsters.
25145 := Canderous, I heard something! Over there, in the shadows! Sounded like a rakghoul!
25146 := Looks like we've got company! Get those blasters ready, boys! 
25147 := Mandalorians don't make threats, we make promises. But I'm just trying to give you a friendly warning. 
25148 := I better get going now.
25149 := So you're just going to run back to the surface like some coward?
25150 := I need to find those Republic escape pods.
25151 := What do you mean by that?
25152 := What do you know about the Lower City gangs?
25153 := What can you tell me about Davik?
25154 := I go where I want, when I want. 
25155 := Who are you?
25156 := Why - is there some danger down here? 
25157 := Are you threatening me? 
25158 := Davik put Canderous in charge of this mission. You got something to say, you say it to the big Mandalorian.
25159 := [You will have to speak to the gate guard to open this.]
25160 := Welcome back, up-worlder. I am surprised to see you again. Many of your kind have passed through our village recently, but few have bothered to speak with me or my people.
25161 := You have done a great thing for my village, up-worlder. Few from the surface would bother to cure an Outcast of the rakghoul disease, as you have done.
25162 := My only regret is that I have no reward to give you for your aid, save my thanks and the thanks of my people.
25163 := Greetings, up-worlder. We rarely see your kind here in the Undercity. I find it strange that so many of you have come down from the surface recently.
25164 := Why have you come into this dark and sunless place? Is there something you need of me or my village? I will help you however I can.
25165 := I am no beggar, though many from the surface think me a far lower creature! We have our pride, despite what those from the surface think of us.
25166 := As you wish, up-worlder. Should you have need of anything else, come speak to me. I represent the entire village and I will do my best to help you however I can.
25167 := You are generous to offer this to us, up-worlder... you have my thanks. But I know nothing of administering the serum. You should bring it to the village healer.
25168 := Our village has seen many visitors from the surface recently: armored troops, swoop gang members, mercenaries. They come to search our sunless world. They are even searching the sewers.
25169 := We are the Outcasts - shunned from the surface for our crimes and banished here to the Undercity. We banded together to form this village that we might survive in this hostile environment.
25170 := I am Gendar, the leader of this village: as my father was, and as was his father before him. Many of us have been here for generations, our ancestors cast down long ago.
25171 := There is no return to the surface for us, or our descendants. But somehow we manage to survive amidst the filth and roaming bands of deadly rakghouls.
25172 := Ask your questions, up-worlder. I will answer to the best of my knowledge, though I know little beyond the borders of the Undercity.
25173 := Ah, you have been speaking with Rukil. I am afraid the Promised Land is nothing but a legend. If such a place existed it surely would have been found by now.
25174 := Rukil is a good man, but he is old and tired. He needs to cling to his illusion to keep his spirit alive. I, on the other hand, have to be more practical. The village relies on me.
25175 := The rakghouls are monsters, hideous mutations who feast on the flesh of our villagers. Their diseased jaws can infect those they attack, transforming the victim into one of those abominations.
25176 := We know of no cure for the disease, and for the good of the village we must banish any who become infected, lest they transform and turn on us.
25177 := Thanks to you some of those who have been infected are now saved, but the rakghouls are still a terrible menace to our village.
25178 := Yes, I have seen this Twi'lek many times, though I have never spoken to her. She and her Wookiee companion often pass through our village on their way to explore the sewers.
25179 := Life down here can be difficult. It can break the spirit... many in the village have become bitter and hopeless. Especially those newly cast down.
25180 := But life goes on, and we must try to make the best of what we have. And maybe someday we will find a better life... Ha! Listen to me. I'm starting to sound like Rukil.
25181 := The oldest man in the village. He is a kind soul, but I am afraid he is growing weary of this world. He dreams of escaping, of finding a better world.
25182 := If you wish to speak to him you can probably find him wandering about the village. As I said, a kind man - though he does cling to his illusions.
25183 := Get away from me, you filthy beggar! 
25184 := I think I'll be going now. 
25185 := I have a serum to save your people from the rakghoul disease.
25186 := You said something about other up-worlders who came by here recently? 
25187 := Who are you people? Why do you live here in the Undercity?
25188 := I want to ask you some questions.
25189 := Do you know anything about the "Promised Land"?
25190 := Tell me about the rakghouls that live down here.
25191 := I'm looking for a Twi'lek named Mission Vao.
25192 := What a horrible way to live!
25193 := Rukil?
25194 := Help! It's right behind me! Help!
25195 := Thank you once again for saving me from the rakghouls, up-worlder. I owe you everything.
25196 := As do I, up-worlder. I don't know what I would have done if anything had happened to Hendar.
25197 := I can't thank you enough for saving me, up-worlder. If I had anything but these rags on my back it would be yours. But we have nothing. 
25198 := I still have you, Hendar. That's all I need. Let's go back to the village.
25199 := Hey there, up-worlder. You want to see what I got for sale in my inventory? Or do you need something else?
25200 := I knew Rukil's legends about the Promised Land were true! Quick - give me those journals so I can destroy them!
25201 := Fine - go to Rukil! But he won't be able to pay you anything for those journals. Come back and see me when you're ready to stop acting crazy and you want to cut a deal.
25202 := Right - your reward. Here's 100 credits; that's a pretty hefty payment for some old notes and maps, eh?
25203 := [Failure] I don't think you understand how much 100 credits is worth down here in the Undercity. This is a small fortune!
25204 := I want those journals, but I'm not rich like you up-worlders. 100 credits is all I can afford.
25205 := [Success] Well, I don't want Rukil to get his hands on them journals. I'll give you 200 credits - that's all I have.
25206 := Excellent - now Rukil will never lead these people to the Promised Land! Now, is there something else you need? You want to look at my inventory?
25207 := Hey, you ain't from the village! You're from the up-world, ain't you? Yes, you've got credits I bet.
25208 := My name's Igear. I run a little salvage shop here. You want to buy something from my store? I got some good deals.
25209 := Yeah, okay. You come back and see me if you want to deal.
25210 := It ain't the best stuff - mostly salvage and such. But the prices are right.
25211 := Oh, you better ask Gendar - he's the spokesman for the village. I just run the store. I don't want to make him mad by answering any questions. Gendar already doesn't like me.
25212 := Gendar seems to think I should share the profits of my store with the whole village. He figures we're all in this together so it should be share and share alike.
25213 := But I'm the one who runs the store! I'm the one who makes the deals! The others just bring me salvage to trade with the up-worlders - why should they get anything?
25214 := He caught me hoarding supplies a while back. I figured I'd wait until food was scarce and then I could offer it to people who'd follow me instead of Gendar. Then I'd be the leader!
25215 := But Gendar made me share my hoard. Ever since then he hasn't trusted me. He keeps me around because of my store, though. Without it this village wouldn't stand a chance.
25216 := Exactly my point. But Gendar doesn't see it that way.
25217 := Hey, you don't know what it's like down here! I have to claw and scrape to survive - nobody else will look out for me. But Gendar doesn't agree with my philosophy.
25218 := If a villager comes across any useful salvage in the Undercity they bring it to me. Every so often members from the Lower City gangs come down to trade for the salvage.
25219 := They'll exchange food and medicine for engine parts, old blasters and the like. Sometimes they even give me credits if I have some really good stuff.
25220 := I saw you talking with Rukil. He told you his legends about the Promised Land, didn't he? He told you all about his missing apprentice and the other lost explorers, right?
25221 := You know, most people don't believe his stories - they figure he's nothing but an old kook. But I think there might be some truth in what he's saying. That's why I want to stop him!
25222 := Oh, don't worry, I'll make this quick. I've got an offer that might be worth your while.
25223 := For an Outcast, I've got things pretty good. The village relies on me to bring in food and supplies - I'm an important man. If it wasn't for Gendar I'd be running this place. 
25224 := But if Rukil ever finds his Promised Land, I'm sunk. People won't need to rely on me anymore. I'll just be another nobody like all the rest of the villagers. I won't let that happen!
25225 := I don't want you to kill Rukil - he's not the problem. It's those damn explorers that went before him. What if they actually found something?
25226 := The two explorers who went searching for the Promised Land might have found something. They might have found clues or evidence - just like Rukil's apprentice!
25227 := They would have recorded that information in their journals. I'll pay you if you bring all three journals to me - the two from the explorers and the one from Rukil's apprentice.
25228 := Then I can destroy the evidence and make sure nobody ever finds the Promised Land! I've saved up enough credits from my business here to make it worth your while if you help me.
25229 := Once you have all three journals just bring them to me and I'll give you a decent reward. Now, was there something else you needed?
25230 := Don't be a fool. I'm the only one here who can pay you for those journals. Rukil has nothing - he won't be able to come up with any kind of reward.
25231 := Don't judge me! I learned a long time ago that if I want to survive down here I've got to look out for number one.
25232 := I have those journals you wanted.
25233 := I've changed my mind. I'm going to give them to Rukil.
25234 := First hand over those credits you promised.
25235 := [Persuade] 100 credits? After all I went through? I want double that!
25236 := 200 credits? It's a deal!
25237 := 100 credits sounds fair. Here's the journals.
25238 := I'll be going now.
25239 := Let me see your inventory.
25240 := I want to ask you some questions.
25241 := Why doesn't Gendar like you?
25242 := That's why Gendar's mad at you? There has to be more to it than that!
25243 := I agree with you - your store, your profits.
25244 := That's a pretty selfish attitude.
25245 := How do you manage to run a store here in the Undercity?
25246 := I don't have time for this.
25247 := Why are you telling me this?
25248 := Stop him? What are you talking about?
25249 := You want me to kill Rukil to shut him up?
25250 := So what do you want me to do?
25251 := Sounds like a good deal to me.
25252 := I'll think about it.
25253 := Forget it! I won't betray Rukil and the village for you.
25254 := That's horrible! How can you be so self-centered?
25255 := Please... you have to help us. We beg you. We don't want to end up like the others. Please help us. We can't end up like them.
25256 := Don't forget about us, up-worlder. If you find anyway to cure us of this disease, please come back and help us.
25257 := Go then, up-worlder. Leave us here to die, abandoned by everyone!
25258 := We have the rakghoul disease. It is only a matter of time until we are transformed into terrible creatures like those who attacked you when you first came into the pen.
25259 := It is too late for them. Soon it will be too late for us and we will transform into those horrible rakghouls ourselves!
25260 := Please hurry, up-worlder. We don't have much time until the transformation.
25261 := You... you will help us? Bless you, up-worlder! But... you must hurry!
25262 := You... you have a cure? Please, give it to me. Quickly, before it's too late.
25263 := We... we have nothing, up-worlder. We are Outcasts. All we have are the clothes on our backs.
25264 := Please, up-worlder. Show us mercy. Give us the cure out of the goodness of your heart!
25265 := Quickly - I must inject it before it is too late. Yes... I feel it working! 
25266 := I feel the disease burning away! It... it is like a miracle! I am cured!
25267 := Thank you, up-worlder. You have saved us from a fate worse than death. I only wish I had some reward to give you. Maybe you can find something worthwhile in the wreckage of that Republic escape pod.
25268 := Not long ago an escape pod crashed in the Undercity, far to the northeast of the village. We were going to try and salvage equipment from it when we were attacked by the rakghouls and infected.
25269 := I'd tell you more if I could, but our salvage team never reached the pod. It's probably still there, unless some of the other up-worlders already found it and picked it clean. 
25270 := We should go now, up-worlder. We're anxious to return to the village and see our families again. Thank you once again for everything you have done.
25271 := When the rakghouls infected me I never thought I'd see my family again. Thank you for all your help, up-worlder.
25272 := Why have you come back, up-worlder? Do you come to mock us in our suffering as this disease destroys us?
25273 := Do you... do you have the cure, up-worlder? Have you come to save us from the horrible fate of the others?
25274 := Goodbye.
25275 := Get away from me you diseased mongrels!
25276 := Who are you? Why are you locked away from the rest of the village?
25277 := Don't worry... I'll be back when I find a cure for you!
25278 := Don't worry - I'm here to help you.
25279 := I have brought you a serum to cure the rakghoul disease.
25280 := Forget it. I'm not wasting the cure on an Outcast!
25281 := What will you give me in exchange for this cure?
25282 := Here, take this rakghoul serum. I have enough for both of you.
25283 := I was just happy to help.
25284 := Republic escape pod? What are you talking about?
25285 := Goodbye.
25286 := Please... you have to help us. We beg you. We don't want to end up like the others. Please help us. We can't end up like them.
25287 := Don't forget about us, up-worlder. If you find any way to cure this disease, please come back and help us.
25288 := Go then, up-worlder. Leave us here to die, abandoned by everyone!
25289 := We have the rakghoul disease. It is only a matter of time until we are transformed into terrible creatures like those who attacked you when you first came into the pen.
25290 := It is too late for them. Soon it will be too late for us and we will transform into those horrible rakghouls ourselves!
25291 := Please hurry, up-worlder. We don't have much time until the transformation.
25292 := You... you will help us? Bless you, up-worlder! Bless you. But... you must hurry!
25293 := You... you have a cure? Please, give it to me. Please. Quickly, before it's too late.
25294 := We... we have nothing, up-worlder. We are Outcasts. All we have are the clothes on our backs.
25295 := Please, up-worlder. Show us mercy. Give us the cure out of the goodness of your heart!
25296 := Quickly - I must inject it before it is too late. Yes... I feel it working! 
25297 := I feel the disease burning away! It... it is like a miracle! I am cured!
25298 := Thank you, up-worlder. You have saved us from a fate worse than death. I only wish I had some reward to give you. Maybe you can find something worthwhile in the wreckage of that Republic escape pod.
25299 := Not long ago an escape pod crashed in the Undercity, far to the northeast of the village. We were going to try and salvage equipment from it but we were attacked by the rakghouls and infected.
25300 := I'd tell you more if I could, but our salvage team never reached the pod. It's probably still there, unless some of the other up-worlders already found it and picked it clean. 
25301 := We should go now, up-worlder. We're anxious to return to the village and see our families again. Thank you once again for everything you have done.
25302 := When the rakghouls infected me I never thought I'd see my family again. Thank you for all your help, up-worlder.
25303 := Why have you come back, up-worlder? Do you come to mock us in our suffering as the disease destroys us?
25304 := Do you... do you have the cure, up-worlder? Have you come to save us from the horrible fate of the others?
25305 := Goodbye.
25306 := Get away from me you diseased mongrels!
25307 := Who are you? Why are you locked away from the rest of the village?
25308 := Don't worry... I'll be back when I find a cure for you!
25309 := Don't worry - I'm here to help you.
25310 := I have brought you a serum to cure the rakghoul disease.
25311 := Forget it. I'm not wasting the cure on an Outcast!
25312 := What will you give me in exchange for this cure?
25313 := Here, take this rakghoul serum. I have enough for both of you.
25314 := I was just happy to help.
25315 := Republic escape pod? What are you talking about?
25316 := Goodbye.
25317 := You're back - does this mean you're going to help me now? Does this mean you're going to help me get Zaalbar back?
25318 := Pleeeze! There's nobody else who can help me! Listen - if you help me get Zaalbar back, I'll help you get inside the Vulkar base. Come on, what do you say?
25319 := How can you be so stubborn? When you're ready to help me with Zaalbar come on back - because you'll never get into that Vulkar base without my help!
25320 := I can't ask Gadon - he's always telling me not to go into the Undercity. He says it's too dangerous with the rakghouls and Gamorreans and all. He'll never send his Beks down there.
25321 := It's a deal - as soon as we get Big Z back, I'll show you a way into that Vulkar base! Now, come on - We have to find Zaalbar before they sell him to slavers - or worse!
25322 := The Gamorreans make their camps in the sewers. I bet that's where we'll find Zaalbar - and that's where I'll show you the secret entrance into the Vulkar compound.
25323 := Do you know where he's being kept?
25324 := Please, you have to help me! Nobody else is going to help me. Even the Beks won't help me. But I can't just leave him there - he's my friend! You'll help me, won't you?
25325 := Gadon? What? I... I don't know what you're talking about. Please - Zaalbar's in trouble. He needs help or they're going to sell him into slavery!
25326 := It's Zaalbar. He's in trouble - big trouble! We have to help him. If we don't they'll sell him into slavery!
25327 := Listen, my friend Zaalbar is in serious trouble, so you can forget about me helping with anything else until I get him back!
25328 := Me... me and Zaalbar were just wandering around here in the Undercity. You know, looking for stuff we could find, just kind of exploring. We do it all the time.
25329 := Only this time they were waiting for us. Gamorrean slave hunters. We didn't even have a chance to run. Big Z threw himself at them, and he roared for me to run!
25330 := I... I took off; I figured Zaalbar would be right behind me. But there were too many of them - he couldn't get away. They're going to sell him to a slaver - I just know it!
25331 := No way. I'm the one that got Zaalbar into this mess, so I'm coming with you. I'm not going to abandon him again!
25332 := I didn't mean to leave him! I thought he was right behind me - I'd never abandon Big Z on purpose! Please - help me get him back.
25333 := I don't know for sure, but those Gamorreans like to hang out in the sewers. The stink reminds them of home, I guess. That's probably where they took Big Z.
25334 := Forget it, kid. You're on your own.
25335 := No deal.
25336 := I don't have time for your Wookiee. I need to find a way into the Vulkar base.
25337 := Why don't you ask Gadon and the Beks to help you?
25338 := If I help you get Zaalbar back you have to get me inside the Vulkar base.
25339 := You're Mission Vao, right? Gadon Thek said you could help me.
25340 := Whoa, slow down, Mission. What's wrong?
25341 := I don't have time for this! Gadon said you'd help me get inside the Vulkar base.
25342 := Fine - tell me what happened and I'll see if I can help you.
25343 := Calm down, Mission. Take a deep breath and tell me what happened.
25344 := Who's going to sell him into slavery? What are you talking about?
25345 := Zaalbar? You mean your Wookiee friend? What happened?
25346 := Wait here. I'll be back when I find Zaalbar.
25347 := You just ran off and left him? Some friend you are.
25348 := Do you know where they took him?
25349 := Rukil Wrinkle-Skin is a funny old man! He talks crazy talk!
25350 := Some of the villagers ain't allowed to live with us no more. They got sick, so they have to go live in the pens.
25351 := Them sick people ain't sick no more. You gave them medicine and now they can live with us again.
25352 := My daddy used to live in the up-world you know. He says I was born there, but I don't remember nothing.
25353 := You from the up-world? My mommy said sometimes water falls from the sky up there, but I think she's joking.
25354 := I'm not allowed to go out past the gate. My daddy went out there once and he never came back. Mommy said the rakghouls got him.
25355 := My mommy's friend got sick. She said he got the rakghoul disease. But we ain't got no medicine to make him better.
25356 := Mommy said you're the one who made her sick friend better. She said you gave him medicine.
25357 := Mommy says all the up-worlders is selfish and mean. But you look nice to me.
25358 := You talked to old Rukil Wrinkle-Skin? My mommy says he's crazy! I have to stay away from him!
25359 := You there! Up-worlder! Anyone using this elevator has to pay the toll! 
25360 := Yeah, this is our elevator! If you use it, you've got to give us something!
25361 := Five credits! That's what it costs to use our elevator! Five credits! 
25362 := Run, my brother! Flee this one's wrath!
25363 := Please, have pity on us. We have nothing. All we ask is a few credits to make our lives easier. 
25364 := Have you no heart? Have you no compassion?
25365 := Come, my brother - let us go. We will get nothing from this selfish up-worlder!
25366 := Credits, my brother! We have credits! Now we can buy food and medicine!
25367 := Hush, or the others will hear us! They'll want our credits! We have to hide them!
25368 := We are not fools... we know all who come from the up-world are rich! Please, is 5 credits so much to ask?
25369 := We are the Outcasts, banished and reviled by those who dwell above!
25370 := Here in the filth and darkness we claw out a wretched existence, scavenging and begging just to survive long enough to see another wretched day.
25371 := This is our village. We live here in the undercity. You have to pay us five credits for using our elevator.
25372 := Get out of here you filthy beggars, or I'll use my blaster to end your suffering permanently!
25373 := This is a public elevator! I'm not paying any toll!
25374 := Forget it! You get nothing from me!
25375 := Okay, here's five credits. 
25376 := I don't have any credits on me.
25377 := Who are you? What are you doing here in the Undercity?
25378 := You poor wretches. Here's 20 credits to buy some food and clothing. 
25379 := A lifetime lived in this dark place can drive you mad! Just look at poor old Rukil if you don't believe me - he's lost his mind!
25380 := You are the one who brought us the rakghoul cure! The entrie village thanks you. I just regret we have nothing to give you as a reward.
25381 := The rakghoul disease can infect you. It can transform you into one of those monsters! I've seen it happen! 
25382 := I once lived above, with the rich and privileged. But I was cast down here - a punishment far worse than my crimes deserved! 
25383 := They say anyone bitten by a rakghoul will become a rakghoul themselves. It can't be true, can it? It's too horrible!
25384 := The rakghouls took my wife! I can only pray she is dead... I cannot bear to even think of the alternative.
25385 := Thank you! My wife was one of those banished because she had the rakghoul disease. If you hadn't cured her, I would have never seen her again!
25386 := A few of the braver villagers dared to leave the safety of the fence. They... they never returned
25387 := Yes, up-worlder? Is there something you need?
25388 := Goodbye, up-worlder.
25389 := Heh. I just guard the gates. Gendar is the leader of the village, up-worlder. You should speak to him if you have any questions.
25390 := I am Trewin, from the Outcast village. It's my job to guard the gates and see they are locked to protect us from the rakghouls.
25391 := The gate is open. If you're going through you have to hurry, up-worlder, before I have to close it again.
25392 := I can't open the gate... not while the rakghouls are so near.
25393 := *Sigh* A horrible fate for poor Hendar. I warned him not to leave the safety of the village. 
25394 := You would risk your life for a stranger? You are brave... or foolish.
25395 := I will open the gate for you, up-worlder, but you've got to be quick. In a few seconds I must close and lock it again for the safety of the village.
25396 := You're not from the village. In fact, you look like you're from the up-world! 
25397 := I don't know why you'd come down here to our village, but I guess I can let you in. There don't seem to be any rakghouls nearby.
25398 := Hurry, up-worlder. I can only leave the gate open for a few seconds. I can't risk letting the rakghouls in!
25399 := Thank you for saving Hendar. You are braver than I, up-worlder. Maybe we Outcasts have lived too long in selfish fear.
25400 := Perhaps we can learn a lesson from your brave actions. Hmph. But enough of my ramblings... is there something you need, up-worlder?
25401 := A horrible fate for poor Hendar... I warned him not to leave the safety of the village.
25402 := But I couldn't open the gate... not while the rakghouls were so close. I had to protect the village.
25403 := But enough of this grim talk... we must focus on the positive if we are to survive down here. How can I help you, up-worlder?
25404 := Goodbye.
25405 := I want to ask you some questions.
25406 := Who are you?
25407 := Open the gate for me.
25408 := Keep the gate closed. I'm not risking my life here.
25409 := You're right, it's too dangerous. Leave the gate closed. 
25410 := Open the gate... I will kill the rakghouls. 
25411 := We have no food, no weapons - nothing! How can we live like this? We are doomed.
25412 := I had fine clothes, a beautiful bed - now I wear rags and I sleep on the ground like an animal! Were my crimes so horrible that I should now suffer like this?
25413 := The rakghouls will devour us all, unless we starve to death first. 
25414 := Thank you... my husband was one of those banished because he had the rakghoul disease. If you hadn't cured him, I would have never seen him again!
25415 := The rakghouls are increasing in number. We cannot even venture beyond the gates for food without being attacked!
25416 := Hurry, Hendar, hurry! I can hear it coming!
25417 := He'll never make it. He's doomed. Argh! I told him he was a fool to leave the village.
25418 := He WILL make it! Run, Hendar! Run!
25419 := Open the gate! Quickly! There isn't much time!
25420 := Ugh... I... I can't... the rakghouls are too close!
25421 := The mutants will kill him if you don't open the gate!
25422 := And if I open the gate they will kill us all!
25423 := No! You can't do this! It isn't fair!
25424 := Hurry - while the gate is still open! You must save Hendar!
25425 := Please, make him open the gate. Hendar will die if he doesn't! 
25426 := I can't open the gate... not while the rakghouls are so near.
25427 := You monster! How can you say that? Somebody do something!
25428 := I'm sorry, Hester - there's nothing we can do. It's too late for Hendar now.
25429 := No! Hendar - no!
25430 := You would risk your life for a stranger? Heh. You are brave, up-worlder.
25431 := I will open the gate for you, but you've got be quick. In a few seconds I must close and lock it again.
25432 := Don't speak to me, up-worlder! You could have saved Hendar. You just stood and watched him die!
25433 := You're as selfish as all the rest from the surface! Please, just leave me alone with my grief.
25434 := Thank you once again for saving me from the rakghouls, up-worlder. I owe you everything.
25435 := As do I, up-worlder. I don't know what I would have done if anything had happened to Hendar.
25436 := I can't thank you enough for saving me, up-worlder. If I had anything but these rags on my back it would be yours. But we have nothing. 
25437 := I still have you, Hendar. That's all I need. Let's go back to the village.
25438 := Keep the gate closed. I'm not risking my life here.
25439 := You're right, it's too dangerous. Leave the gate closed. 
25440 := Open the gate... I will kill the rakghouls. 
25441 := Back again. Is there something else you need?
25442 := You amaze me. I always thought the surface dwellers couldn't care less about us Outcasts. But you risked everything to help those infected villagers! 
25443 :=  I wish I had some type of reward to give you, but we Outcasts have nothing. All I can offer is the gratitude of the entire village. 
25444 := Wait, up-worlder. You can't go through this gate. There is too much danger and suffering beyond. For your own sake, turn back.
25445 := Farewell.
25446 := I'm only warning you for your own protection, up-worlder.
25447 := The villagers infected with the rakghoul disease are quarantined beyond this gate. It's only a matter of time until they transform into horrible creatures that would destroy us all.
25448 := For the sake of the village, we have to keep the infected ones locked away. And when they finally do transform into rakghouls we'll let them destroy each other.
25449 := I can't stop you from going through the gates, up-worlder. But if the infected ones have already transformed into rakghouls you'll be walking into your grave.
25450 := Nothing can be done for the infected villagers. Even the serum to counteract the rakghoul disease wouldn't be any use, now. 
25451 := If you have questions you should speak to Gendar. He's the leader of this village. All my attention has to stay focused on trying to ease the suffering of those within the village.
25452 := I am Esala, healer of this village. I use my knowledge and what little resources we have to care for the Outcasts who are sick or injured.
25453 := But despite my medical training, there is nothing I can do to help the poor souls locked on the other side of this gate.
25454 := Your offer is generous, up-worlder, but the serum is useless to us now.
25455 := The villagers infected with the rakghoul disease have been quarantined beyond this gate. At any moment they could be transformed into terrible monsters.
25456 := Nobody would be foolish enough to risk going into the pens to give them the cure: the infected ones could transform into rakghouls and attack them at any moment.
25457 := I can't help the infected ones. They have to die so that the rest of the village can live. I accept this. If you think that makes me a coward, so be it.
25458 := Goodbye.
25459 := You can't tell me where I can and can't go!
25460 := I'm going through those gates to try and help the infected ones!
25461 := There must be something someone can do!
25462 := I want to ask you some questions.
25463 := Danger and suffering? What are you talking about?
25464 := Who are you?
25465 := What are you talking about?
25466 := I have brought you a serum to cure the rakghoul disease.
25467 := So you'll just leave the infected ones to die? You're a coward!
25468 := H... help me! Please! I can... I can feel it inside my skin! Something growing... like some kind of hideous disease!
25469 := No... no!!! I can feel... ARGH!
25470 := Th... thank you. Those things - they attacked as soon as we came out the doors. They... they killed the others. It was... it was horrible.
25471 := Bastila? She wasn't in this pod. We were tracking her pod just before we hit the planet's surface. It went down somewhere to the west. 
25472 := We lost the signal when our own pod crashed. Maybe... wait - what was that? Did you hear that? I thought I heard something.
25473 := Over there... I heard something. I know I did! There it is again! It's those monsters! They're coming back! Run for your lives!
25474 := Get away from me, you diseased freak!
25475 := I'll help you, but I need some information first.
25476 := I'm sorry... there's nothing I can do for you.
25477 := Wait here... I'll see if I can find something to help you.
25478 := Here, take this serum. It will cure you.
25479 := Quit whining and start talking! I need to know where Bastila is! 
25480 := Don't change the subject. I still have some questions to ask you.
25481 := I didn't hear anything. 
25482 := You're okay now. But I need information. I'm looking for Bastila.
25483 := Greetings once more, up-worlder. Do you bring news of my apprentice? Have you discovered her fate, and proved yourself to be a true savior of my people?
25484 := You seek my wisdom, but I dare not share my knowledge with you. Not yet. Not until you prove yourself to be the one foretold, the one who will guide us to salvation.
25485 := Find my apprentice. Discover what fate has befallen her and I will know you are worthy, and not another false prophet sent to mislead my people!
25486 := It is as I feared, then. She joins the list of those who have given their lives in the service of our cause. But though I am saddened by this news, there is yet hope.
25487 := By finding my apprentice you have proved yourself worthy, up-worlder. You are to be the beacon on our path to salvation. You will guide us to the Promised Land!
25488 := You are marked, up-worlder - even my dim old eyes can see the mantle of destiny that cloaks you. Perhaps old Rukil knows you better than you know yourself.
25489 := I am old - I have lived a hundred years in the Undercity, cast down into the darkness. I know the legends and history of our people - and now you must learn it, too.
25490 := I offer you wisdom and you turn me away? Perhaps you are not ready to accept the role you must play in the destiny and salvaton of my people.
25491 := Very well, up-worlder. Return to me when you are ready to learn what you must learn.
25492 := The great city of Taris covers the entire surface of this planet. There is no land to grow food. Kelp harvests and the creatures of the sea are our only food source.
25493 := A century ago rising levels of toxic pollution poisoned the oceans and famine swept the planet. The rich hoarded food for their own use, and the poor were left to starve and die.
25494 := But the poor rose up against this tyranny and civil war engulfed the planet. Millions died in the fighting and huge sections of Taris were destroyed or abandoned. 
25495 := The rebellion was crushed in the end, thousands were taken prisoner. The jails could not hold them all, and so the practice of banishing all prisoners to the Undercity was born.
25496 := Many brave men and women were banished here to the Undercity for their part in the rebellion. People like my father and grandfather were cast down, along with their families.
25497 := Now we live a dark existence beneath the streets of Taris, a life devoid of all hope but one: the Promised Land. And you will be the one to show us the way to get there.
25498 := Legends tell of a self-sufficient colony founded just before the famine and lost during the civil war; a paradise beneath the Undercity where droid servants tend to every need.
25499 := For many years I searched for the Promised Land, just as my grandfather and father did before me. When I became old and gray my apprentice continued the search on my behalf.
25500 := I have collected many clues hinting at its location; the journal of my apprentice provides yet more information. But still there are too many pieces missing from this puzzle.
25501 := But I know my father and grandfather each had journals where they recorded their own discoveries. Perhaps with their journals I could at last uncover its hidden location.
25502 := Please, up-worlder - I am too old to search for the missing journals myself, and the other villagers think the Promised Land is nothing but a myth. 
25503 := I see. Well, perhaps you are not the savior I seek after all. I can only pray that if you find the journals you will have a change of heart and bring them to me.
25504 := I have nothing to offer if you help me in this. I hope the knowledge that you are helping the entire village escape a life of darkness and suffering is reward enough.
25505 := It is many decades since my father set out on his journey, but I remember he was eager to explore the sewers. You might want to begin your search there.
25506 := I wish you luck in your quest, up-worlder. The future survival of this village - of my people - depends on you.
25507 := What did you expect? If they could get away with it the Tarisian nobles would stuff their own mothers down here to make more room in the Upper City. 
25508 := You - you come from the world above! Is this the time of destiny, then? Is this a portent of the salvation of my people? Or merely another false sign to mislead us from the path?
25509 := Are you the herald of prophecy? The beacon to guide us through the darkness? Or are you merely another harbinger of shattered dreams and unfulfilled promises?
25510 := Speak to me, up-worlder! Tell me what fate you unleash upon us - salvation or damnation! Speak, up-worlder - I beg you!
25511 := Old, yes. But not insane. Oh no, not insane at all! I am as rational as any man can be after a hundred years in the filth and darkness of the Undercity!
25512 := Perhaps I can make things more clear. Some things, at least. My name is Rukil, the oldest Outcast here in the village. Rukil Wrinkle-Skin, the children call me sometimes.
25513 := Once I was honored for my wisdom, but over time the villagers fell away from the true path. Eventually there was only a single apprentice who followed me - and now she is gone, too.
25514 := Please, a moment up-worlder. I must know if you are the one I have been waiting for. Please, I beg for your help.
25515 := My apprentice is... lost. I sent her out into the Undercity to find... well, I cannot tell you. Not yet. Sadly, my apprentice has not returned.
25516 := Please, up-worlder - will you help an old man? Will you seek out my apprentice in the Undercity? Her name is Malya. I must know of her fate, whatever it may be. I must know what she... found.
25517 := Finding her may be difficult; Malya could be anywhere in the Undercity... but if you find her I will know you to be our true savior! Only then can I reveal my secret knowledge to you.
25518 := Then... perhaps you are not the one I have been waiting for. Should you change your mind, up-worlder, speak with me again. Come to me if you learn the fate of my apprentice.
25519 := I wish you luck, up-worlder. Come speak to me again once you have discovered the fate of my apprentice.
25520 := No, no, no. Not yet. I must be wary. Careful. You may be a false savior. Dare I share my secrets with you? No... not until you prove yourself.
25521 := A question. You are uncertain. Bewildered. Perplexed. Understandable, I suppose. Even after a hundred years of life I myself still become confused at times.
25522 := This old man's demeanor may seem crazed, but I sense there is a purpose behind it, a benevolent one. He is no danger to us.
25523 := Be careful... this one might be crazy enough to be dangerous.
25524 := Watch yourself: this guy's star chart is missing a few galaxies, if you know what I mean.
25525 := Welcome back, up-worlder. How goes your quest? Have you found the journals of my father and grandfather?
25526 := Yes, up-worlder... well done. However, I see that this journal alone does not have enough clues for me to solve this mystery. Too many pieces are still missing.
25527 := I'm afraid that only with all three journals - my grandfather's, my father's and my apprentice's - will I be able to discover the location of the Promised Land.
25528 := I will leave this journal with you for safe keeping for now. Perhaps it will aid you in your search for the others. I wish you luck, up-worlder - for the sake of the entire village.
25529 := Can it be true? Is it possible that at long last the dream of my father and grandfather before him will be fulfilled? I... I can hardly bear to look.
25530 := Hmmm... yes. Yes! Of course! Now I understand - it all makes sense! Now I see why the Promised Land has been so hard to find! It is so obvious!
25531 := You have done a great thing, up-worlder - a selfless act that will bring great joy to all the people of this village! I must take this to Gendar right away!
25532 := Rukil? What do you want now? Have you more fables of a hidden paradise just waiting for us to find it?
25533 := You may not think these are fables after you see what I have brought you, Gendar! Look at these journals!
25534 := What... no. It can't be! Are these real, Rukil? Is this information accurate?
25535 := I swear to you everything in these journals is true, Gendar. The Promised Land - I told you I would find it!
25536 := The entrance is far from here, Rukil. It will take us weeks to get there... perhaps even months. And we will have to cross many rakghoul infested areas.
25537 := I do not deny the journey will be hard, Gendar. But surely it is better than the miserable life we have here!
25538 := Wise words, Rukil. Our supplies are high right now - we could leave by nightfall! I will tell the others to prepare for the journey.
25539 := Thank you once again, up-worlder. I will say a final goodbye, for where we are going I fear you cannot come. The journey to the Promised Land is long and arduous.
25540 := No, up-worlder, I cannot ask that. The journey will take many, many weeks. And those who make the journey cannot return - that was the final secret of the Promised Land.
25541 := When the colony was created it was designed so that people could enter willingly, but they could never leave again. This was to ensure secrecy on the project.
25542 := We must part ways here, up-worlder. I sense your destiny is yet to be chosen, but the destiny of my people is at the end of the long journey ahead of us.
25543 := You return, up-worlder. Are you ready now to learn what you must learn? Are you ready to hear the history of my people?
25544 := You return, up-worlder. Are you ready to learn what you must learn? Are you ready to learn of the Promised Land?
25545 := False prophet! Deceiver! You have betrayed me! You have sold the hope of the entire village to the selfish and damnable Igear!
25546 := All I have worked for is destroyed! All the hopes and dreams of my father and grandfather before him turned to dust! Begone, up-worlder - I have only curses to speak at you!
25547 := I haven't found her yet, but I will.
25548 := I want to ask you some questions.
25549 := Your apprentice is dead. I have her journal.
25550 := Hold on a second - I'm not guiding anybody anywhere!
25551 := I'm not interested in the history of your people.
25552 := Very well - tell me the history of your people.
25553 := Are you going to get to the point soon?
25554 := What does this have to do with me?
25555 := Is that how you came to be down here?
25556 := I'm not interested in this.
25557 := How can I lead you to this Promised Land when I don't even know what it is?
25558 := The Promised Land? What's that?
25559 := I'm not wasting my time looking for these journals!
25560 := Forget it.
25561 := What will I get if I find these missing journals for you?
25562 := Sorry, I need an actual reward if you want my help.
25563 := Don't worry, Rukil. I'll find those journals.
25564 := And you want me to find these missing journals?
25565 := I think you have me confused with someone else.
25566 := Guide you? But I don't even know where the Promised Land is!
25567 := You're obviously an insane old kook.
25568 := Okay, enough of this. So long, you crazy freak.
25569 := I don't have time for this nonsense.
25570 := What happened to your apprentice?
25571 := Forget it, old man. I'm not interested.
25572 := What will you give me if I help you?
25573 := I will help you with this, Rukil.
25574 := I'm not going to waste my time looking for your apprentice!
25575 := I'll be back if I find anything out.
25576 := The true path? What does that mean?
25577 := Prove myself? How can I do that?
25578 := Uh... okay, then. Could I ask you some questions?
25579 := What are you talking about, old man?
25580 := I can't waste any more time with your quest.
25581 := I have one of the journals you're looking for.
25582 := I don't have all the journals yet, but I will find them.
25583 := I have all three journals. Here - take them.
25584 := Maybe I should come with you. I could help you on the journey.
25585 := Goodbye, Rukil - and good luck.
25586 := Tell me about the Promised Land.
25587 := Hello, again. I'm glad you came back... it's kind of neat to speak to someone from the surface world. Is there anything I can do for you?
25588 := Oh... okay. Well, if you ever need anything, or if you just feel like talking, come back and see me. I hardly ever get a chance to speak to someone from the up-world.
25589 := I saw you talking with Rukil. It's nice of you to help him; though I don't want to get my hopes up. I mean, the Promised Land... how could it be true?
25590 := It's just that sometimes Rukil seems so certain. And then you show up, just like the up-world savior from the legends... If Rukil's right this could be a whole new life for the village!
25591 := No more rakghoul attacks, no more starvation... *sigh*, I shouldn't get my hopes up. Not yet. But... but I will wish you good luck, on behalf of the entire village.
25592 := Go on, you two! Get out of here! I'm sorry about that... those two beggars give everyone in the village a bad name! We aren't all like that, you know. Most of us are good people.
25593 := My name is Shaleena... you're from the up-world, aren't you? I've... I've never seen it. I was born here in the Undercity. Is it as nice as they say up there?
25594 := Of course... I'm sorry. You're probably here for something important, right? You probably want to speak to Gendar. He's the leader of our village.
25595 := But if you... if you have time later, maybe you could come back and speak to me again. I don't get much chance to talk with people from the surface.
25596 := I... I suppose our world doesn't look like much to you. It's dark and cold and lonely down here - but this is the only world I've ever known.
25597 := Not to you, I suppose. But you're probably used to its beauty by now.
25598 := I've never been to the surface, but sometimes I think I can see it in my dreams. The sun, the sky, the stars... it all sounds so... so... so wonderful. 
25599 := Gendar, the leader of our village, tells me I should spend more time trying to improve things down here and less time dreaming about something I can never have. Maybe he's right.
25600 := You probably think I'm a fool, having dreams of a place I've never even seen. But when I was little, Rukil used to tell me stories of what it was like up there.
25601 := You'd probably get more information from Gendar, the village leader. Or maybe Rukil. But I'll tell you whatever I can.
25602 := Well, I was born here for starters. My parents were Outcasts, banished to the Undercity for some crime or other... they never really liked to talk about it.
25603 := Everyone here is an Outcast... or the descendant of one. It's tough down here, but we survive. I guess it's easier for me, since I've never known anything different.
25604 := Some of the people have given up all hope; they've become bitter and depressed. But most of us are good people... despite what our ancestors may have done.
25605 := Gendar could probably tell you more. Or maybe Rukil. You could talk to them if you want.
25606 := There were quite a few people from the surface marching through the village, but none of them bothered to talk to me. Gendar might know more about them.
25607 := I don't know anything about that, but maybe Gendar could help you. Sorry... is there anything else you need?
25608 := He's wandering around somewhere on the south side of the village. He doesn't move too far... it's hard on his bones. He's over 100 years old!
25609 := The children laugh at him and people think he's crazy because of his stories about the Promised Land, but he's really just a kind old man.
25610 := He'll be somewhere in the village. I couldn't say where for sure. He's always busy, doing whatever he can to make the lives of the other villagers easier.
25611 := Rukil's the oldest man in the village. The kids call him Rukil Wrinkle-Skin, but he's a kind man. He used to tell me the greatest stories when I was a little girl.
25612 := I still like to listen to his tales about the Promised Land, even though I know they're just legends. But it helps to make the Undercity seem less... less dark, somehow. 
25613 := It's... it's just a story to make little children smile. Rukil believes in it, though. Sometimes I can almost believe it myself, but then I look around and I see the ugly truth.
25614 := *sigh* I guess we have to make the best of what we have though. If you really want to learn more about the promised land you should speak to Rukil.
25615 := I saw what you did! You gave those journals to Igear! Now we'll never find the promised land! How could you do that, you monster!
25616 := Just get away from me! I don't want to speak to you again!
25617 := I'll be going now.
25618 := I don't have time for this.
25619 := It's better than this festering slime pit.
25620 := It's nothing special.
25621 := The surface is a beautiful place.
25622 := I want to ask you some questions.
25623 := Tell me about this village.
25624 := Have any other up-worlders come through here recently?
25625 := Do you know anything about the escape pods that crashed into the Undercity?
25626 := Where can I find Rukil?
25627 := Where can I find Gendar?
25628 := Rukil? Who's that?
25629 := The Promised Land? What's that?
25630 := You there! Civilian! This is a restricted area! What are you doing down here?
25631 := Look out! It's an ambush!
25632 := You're questioning the Sith? How many people do we have to kill before the rest of you learn some respect?
25633 := Well, I guess it's time for another lesson. Patrol... attack!
25634 := Security papers? Oh... you're one of those trackers the Commander sent down, right? They should have given you an armed escort - it's nasty down here!
25635 := We've already lost one patrol... we figure the rakghouls got them. We've had so many encounters with those things we've actually run out of rakghoul serum.
25636 := Plus we've had several skirmishes with looters from those Lower City swoop gangs. I'm telling you, we should just stay in the Upper City where we're in control!
25637 := Yeah, sure... the Commander won't be too happy if you come back empty, right? Same thing goes for us.
25638 := Hey, I'd never disobey my orders... I'm not a fan of court martials and executions. I was just talking, you know? Nothing anyone has to mention to the Commander.
25639 := Come on patrol, let's get back to it. The sooner we get this search done the sooner we can get out of this mutant infested hole. Move out!
25640 := Oh, is that why you're down here? Search and rescue? I didn't think they would send anyone. They were in the southern section of the Undercity when we lost contact.
25641 := I would have gone to investigate, but my orders are to search for those crashed escape pods... even if it means leaving another patrol to die.
25642 := I'm just here to kill you!
25643 := I don't like your tone!
25644 := Look... I've got all the proper security papers.
25645 := I should be going now.
25646 := You're annoying me - time to die!
25647 := Why don't you just give up the search?
25648 := You just follow your orders and keep looking!
25649 := You said you lost one patrol already?
25650 := Please, help us! We are infected with the rakghoul disease. At any moment we could... unh!

25811 := My tone? I'm leading a patrol through the reeking sewers under constant attack from mutants and rogue droids! And you have a problem with my tone?
25812 := I'm going to ask you one last time, civilian - what are you doing down here!
25813 := Papers? Don't wave those in my face - anyone can forge papers! Call me crazy, but I'm suspicious of anyone wandering around in these sewers, even if they have papers! 
25814 := Unless you want me to take you in for questioning you better tell me what you're doing down here!
25815 := [Success] Hey, settle down. I don't want any trouble with the Commander. But you can't blame me for being on edge after getting stuck with an assignment like this!
25816 := [Failure] Nice try, but I'm not buying it. I think you're a spy!
25817 := [Success] Okay, okay. You've got your papers, I get it. You can't blame me for being a little on edge after getting stuck with an assignment like this!
25818 := Wandering around these stinking sewers under constant attack from rakghouls... we've already run out of rakghoul serum! Plus I heard we lost one of our patrols in the Undercity.
25819 := Yeah, right. Same goes for us.
25820 := And get court martialed? What kind of talk is that? Wait a minute... you're a spy! You're trying to undermine the discipline of the Sith troops!
25821 := Time for you to learn how we deal with spies!
25822 := You don't have to tell me my orders! I'm a patrol leader... I know what's expected of me and my men!
25823 := Come on boys... let's get out of here. The sooner we get this search done the sooner we can get out of these filthy tunnels. Move out!
25824 := From what I heard they were in the southern section of the Undercity when contact with the base was cut off. They haven't been heard from since. Probably another rakghoul attack.
25825 := And nobody's even out looking for them. Finding those downed escape pods takes priority over everything else, even the lives of a patrol. An order like that isn't good for moral.
25826 := I'm just here to kill you!
25827 := I don't like your tone!
25828 := Look... I've got all the proper security papers.
25829 := [Persuade] Back off or I'll report you for interfering with my mission!
25830 := [Persuade] My papers aren't forged. I'm down here on official Sith business.
25831 := I have to get back to my mission now.
25832 := You're annoying me - time to die!
25833 := Why don't you just give up the search?
25834 := You just follow your orders and keep looking!
25835 := You lost a patrol?
25836 := You're a sight for sore eyes, Mission.
25837 := I'm glad to see you too, Big Z! You didn't think I'd forget about you - Mission and Zaalbar, together forever!
25838 := Who's that with you?
25839 := These are my new friends, Big Z. Without them I never could have got you out. 
25840 := You have saved me from a life of servitude and slavery. There is only one way I can ever repay such an act: I will swear a lifedebt to you.
25841 := A lifedebt? Are you sure about that, Big Z? Think about it carefully. You better be sure about this.
25842 := I am sure, Mission. This is an issue of great importance to me. Because of our great physical strength, Wookiees are being used as slave labor on our own homeworld.
25843 := They see us as brutes and animals to be exploited. Over the years slavers have taken many of my people; we must always be on guard against raids against our villages. 
25844 := When the Gamorreans captured me, I thought I was doomed to a life of servitude. I have been saved from such a fate, and the only way I can repay that is through a lifedebt.
25845 := Big Z swearing a Wookiee lifedebt to you. Wow - this is major. Do you realize what this means?
25846 := Hey - Zaalbar's not your slave! He just swore a lifedebt to you. It's not the same thing.
25847 := Hey - don't make fun of the lifedebt! This is serious business, you know?
25848 := A lifedebt is the most solemn vow a Wookiee can make. It means he'll stay by your side for the rest of your life - wherever you go, whatever you do, Zaalbar will be with you.
25849 := In the presence of you all I swear my lifedebt. Forever after I will be by your side, <FullName>. May my vow be as strong as the roots of the great Wroshyr trees of Kashyyyk.
25850 := Sorry, but there's not much you can do about it. Zaalbar's already sworn the lifedebt and it's not something they can just take back. This is a sacred, irreversible vow.
25851 := I guess this means you're stuck with me too. Wherever Big Z goes, I'm going. I almost lost him once - it's not going to happen again.
25852 := Hey - don't underestimate me! I may be young, but I'm quick and plenty smart. You just give me a chance and you'll be surprised at how useful I can be.
25853 := So... I guess I still owe you one secret path into the Vulkar base. That was the deal, wasn't it? Don't worry, I know a backdoor into that scum den!
25854 := I better come with you - the Vulkars put up a force shield to keep the sewer dwellers out. I'm one of the only non-Vulkars on Taris who can get you past it.
25855 := I can't remember exactly how to get there, but I know it was somewhere here in the sewers. Over to the northeast, if I remember right. I just hope the rancor monster isn't still there.
25856 := You did a good job mopping up those Gamorreans, but I don't think you want to take on a rancor! Those things are huge!
25857 := There used to be a rancor monster that made its nest in that part of the sewers. Pretty much eats anything it can get its claws on. That thing is huge!
25858 := Luckily rancors aren't too bright. I was able to sneak past it before, so I'm sure we'll figure something out. That is, unless you want to change your mind.
25859 := Okay then, off we go. Like I said, somewhere to the south-east. Just look for the force shield and we'll know we're there.
25860 := So, is there some kind of reward for freeing you?
25861 := Don't mention it. I was happy to help.
25862 := I've always wanted a Wookiee slave!
25863 := Let me guess - it means I got a walking carpet following me for the rest of my days.
25864 := I'm not sure.
25865 := I don't suppose there's any way I can get out of this?
25866 := I don't want a Wookiee following me around all the time!
25867 := I'm honored to accept his vow.
25868 := Why won't this nightmare end!
25869 := Great - a Wookiee and a snot-nosed punk!
25870 := I'm glad to have you aboard, Mission.
25871 := Just tell me how to get there.
25872 := Good. The sooner we get there the better.
25873 := A rancor monster? Good - I'm spoiling for a fight!
25874 := Whoa - nobody said anything about a rancor monster!

25930 := You there! Civillian! This is a restricted area! What are you doing down here?
25931 := Look out! It's an ambush!
25932 := My tone? I'm leading a patrol through the reeking sewers under constant attack from mutants and rogue droids! And you have a problem with my tone?
25933 := I'm going to ask you one last time, civilian - what are you doing down here!
25934 := Papers? Don't wave those in my face - anyone can forge papers! Call me crazy, but I'm suspicious of anyone wandering around in these sewers, even if they have papers! 
25935 := Unless you want me to take you in for questioning you better tell me what you're doing down here!
25936 := [Success] Hey, settle down. I don't want any trouble with the Commander. But you can't blame me for being on edge after getting stuck with an assignment like this!
25937 := [Failure] Nice try, but I'm not buying it. I think you're a spy!
25938 := [Success] Okay, okay. You've got your papers, I get it. You can't blame me for being a little on edge after getting stuck with an assignment like this!
25939 := Wandering around these stinking sewers under constant attack from rakghouls... we've already run out of rakghoul serum! Plus I heard we lost one of our patrols in the Undercity.
25940 := Yeah, right. Same goes for us.
25941 := And get court martialed? What kind of talk is that? Wait a minute... you're a spy! You're trying to undermine the discipline of the Sith troops!
25942 := Time for you to learn how we Sith deal with spies!
25943 := You don't have to tell me my orders! I'm a patrol leader... I know what's expected of me and my men!
25944 := Come on boys... let's get out of here. The sooner we get this search done the sooner we can get out of these filthy tunnels. Move out!
25945 := From what I heard they were in the southern section of the Undercity when contact with the base was cut off. They haven't been heard from since. Probably another rakghoul attack.
25946 := And nobody's even out looking for them. Finding those downed escape pods takes priority over everything else, even the lives of a patrol. An order like that isn't good for moral.
25947 := I'm just here to kill you!
25948 := I don't like your tone!
25949 := Look... I've got all the proper security papers.
25950 := [Persuade] Back off or I'll report you for interfering with my mission!
25951 := [Persuade] My papers aren't forged. I'm down here on official Sith business.
25952 := I have to get back to my mission now.
25953 := You're annoying me - time to die!
25954 := Why don't you just give up the search?

26016 := I mad now! See how you like me call guards! You die now!
26017 := No - no question! You get out or me get mad!
26018 := Get out. No bother me more!
26019 := Time to die, bug-face!
26020 := I want to ask you some questions.
26021 := Answer my questions or I'll carve my initials in your skull with my blaster bolts!
26022 := Okay, settle down - I'm going.
26023 := Sorry, wrong room.
26024 := I tried to play nice, but I guess you're too stupid to figure it out! You keep coming back and bothering me!
26025 := I guess the only way you'll get the message is if I kill you!
26026 := Hey - what's the idea barging in here! Get out of here or I'll call the guards.
26027 := The guards? Slaves aren't allowed out of the slave quarters! I can't let them see me here!
26028 := Hey, baby - wait! I wasn't actually going - DAMNIT! Okay, great. You just scared off my date for the night, so you better explain yourself before I lose my temper and call the guards!
26029 := You should have picked an easier target! By the time the guards show up they'll have to take you out of here in pieces!
26030 := Ha! Big talk little man.
26031 := Good grief. Is he kidding us?
26032 := [Success] Okay, I guess it was an honest mistake. Give me the credits and I'll forget this ever happened.
26033 := [Failure] Uh-uh. No way. You ain't getting out of this mess that easy! You can explain yourself to the guards - if you live long enough for them to question you!
26034 := [Success] Okay, I guess it was just an honest mistake. And I'm a reasonable man, so I'll just let it go this time.
26035 := You better pay more attention to where you're going. Opening the wrong door around here can get you killed. Now get out of here and don't bother me again!
26036 := You can't call the guards if you're dead!
26037 := [Persuade] Sorry I wrecked your night. Here's 50 credits for the inconvenience.
26038 := [Persuade] No need to call the guards - I just got lost. 
26039 := You again? My instructions were not complicated. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't call the other guards and have your incompetence reported to the commanding officer! 
26040 := [Success] Well, if you think I'm going to tip you again you're sadly mistaken. Now leave me be.
26041 := How dare you invade my chambers! How rude! I am a personal guest of Davik himself! I left specific instructions that you guards were not to disturb me until morning!
26042 := How can Davik expect me to invest in his ventures with this kind of incompetence on display? I should summon the other guards and report you to your commanding officer!
26043 := What? How dare you speak to me like that! I could ask Davik to have you flayed alive for such insolence!
26044 := What? But... help! Assassins! Guards - help!
26045 := Don't work for Davik? Then what are you... oh blast! Assassins! Guards, save me!
26046 := [Failure] That is no excuse for incompetence! I gave very specific orders that were not followed. I'm going to summon the guards and report you to your superiors!
26047 := [Success] Well, I suppose I can forgive the intrusion in this case. Tell Davik I admire a host who has his underlings check up on the well-being and comfort of his guests.
26048 := I don't require anything right now - you can tell Davik everything about my stay has been most pleasing so far. Here's a five credit chip for your trouble, sirrah.
26049 := Now scurry on back to Davik. If I find I have need of anything I'll buzz for you. Until then I expect you to respect my privacy.
26050 := [Persuade/Lie] I'm just checking up on you again.
26051 := You touch that alarm and you're a dead man!
26052 := That's it - time for you to die!
26053 := I don't work for Davik, you over-inflated windbag!
26054 := [Persuade/Lie] Uh... Davik just wanted me to make sure you didn't need anything.
26055 := Thank you, sir.
26056 := So, Canderous - I see you have brought someone with you. Most intriguing, if I do say so myself. You usually travel alone.
26057 := It's not like you to take on partners, Canderous. You're getting soft.
26058 := Watch yourself, Calo. You may be the newest kath hound in the pack, but you aren't top dog yet!
26059 := Enough! I won't have my top two men killing each other - that's not good business. I'm sure Canderous has an explanation as to why he's not working solo anymore.
26060 := This is a special case, Davik. I ran into someone the Exchange might want to recruit. You may have heard something of their exploits already.
26061 := Ah, yes - now I recognize your companion. The rider who won the big swoop race. Very impressive... as was your display in the rather heated battle afterwards.
26062 := A casual fan at best, but everyone on Taris follows the big season opener. But we have more important issues to discuss now.
26063 := With a recommendation from Canderous - and a thorough background check - you could become part of the Exchange. Many would kill to prove themselves worthy of this honor.
26064 := Don't be so hasty. Our allies end up much better off than our enemies - as both Canderous and Calo Nord could surely tell you. The Exchange has much to offer.
26065 := Come with me - I will give you a tour of my operations. I'm certain you'll be most impressed.
26066 := Ah, there she is - the Ebon Hawk. My pride and joy; the fastest ship in the Outer Rim! Note the state of the art security system I've had installed to protect her.
26067 := The shields are completely impregnable. Nobody can get past them without the codes to try and steal my baby. Unfortunately, the Sith military blockade has grounded my vessel. 
26068 := The Ebon Hawk can outrun any vessel in the galaxy, but even she isn't fast enough to avoid the auto-targeting laser cannons of the orbiting Sith fleet.
26069 := I am, of course, working on acquiring the Sith departure codes so that I may come and go as I please. However, progress has been slow... but we should continue our tour. 
26070 := These will be your accommodations. The slave quarters are just down the hall. If you need anything during your stay - food, a massage - feel free to call upon their services. 
26071 := If all goes well with your background check you will be invited to join the Exchange. I'd advise you to accept the offer when it comes - or suffer the dire consequences of refusal.
26072 := You will stay in these rooms as my guest for the next few days; I will not accept no for an answer. Feel free to visit the slave quarters at any time during your stay. 
26073 := I must warn you that if you are found anywhere outside the guest wing during your stay - or if you bother my other guests - my security forces will deal with you most harshly.
26074 := I will return after the investigation into your background is complete. Until then, make yourself comfortable. Come, Calo, let us leave our guests in peace.
26075 := Okay, we're inside. Now all we have to do is figure out a way to get past the Ebon Hawk's security system and we can get the rest of your group and get off this planet!
26076 := No sense waiting around here, though. The sooner we get off Taris the better.
26077 := An important lesson to learn, no doubt. In my line of business I've seen far too many people suffer for not understanding it.
26078 := You know, Canderous was right. The Exchange is always looking for new talent. You could have a bright future with our organization.
26079 := I didn't know you were a swoop fan.
26080 := Sorry, I'm not interested.
26081 := Am I a prisoner here? 
26082 := I'm sorry, but I can't stay. 
26083 := I'm looking forward to working with you, Davik. 
26084 := Your offer intrigues me, Davik.
26085 := Brejik had to learn that double-crossers tend to end up dead!
26086 := It was nothing I couldn't handle.
26087 := Damn those Sith - they're bombing the whole planet! I knew they'd turn on us sooner or... well, look what we got here! Thieves in the hangar.
26088 := So, you figured you'd just steal my ship for your get-away and leave me high and dry while the Sith turn the planet into dust? Sorry, but that ain't going to happen!
26089 := I'll take care of them, Davik. I've been looking forward to this for a long time!
26090 := Make it quick, Calo. The Sith mean business. If we don't get to our ships and find somewhere safe, the bombs they're dropping will kill us all.
26091 := I greet you once more, master. How may this humble servant be of use to you?
26092 := Welcome to the slave quarters, master. Here we have succulent fruits and berries to tempt your palette, as well as luxurious baths to soothe your aches and pains.
26093 := Would you like a relaxing massage? Whatever your desire, we are here to serve.
26094 := Of course. Return whenever you wish to partake of what is offered here. We exist only to serve.
26095 := As you wish, master. You will find this most relaxing. If you would come with me into the massage room at the back...
26096 := I trust you were satisfied with the service? I have received many compliments on my skills from previous clients.
26097 := My, you certainly have a great hunger for my services. I will do my best to sate your prodigious appetites with another massage, master.
26098 := Please, I beg you - don't tell Davik you are displeased with me! He punishes those slaves who do not satisfy his guests!
26099 := As... as you wish, master. It will not be the first time I have been punished by Davik.
26100 := I am sorry I have failed to please you, master. I will try to do better in the future. Is there anything else you require from this most unworthy servant?
26101 := I have no wish to be beaten by Davik, so I will tell you all I know. I hope it is enough to buy your mercy.
26102 := Thank you, kind sir. I hope you will express your appreciation to Davik. He often rewards those slaves who perform their duties well. Is there anything else you require?
26103 := Umm... not to interrupt your fun, but we do have to get underway...
26104 := How typically male. Is it possible for you to keep in mind that we have more pressing business to attend to?
26105 := But... what could I possibly tell you? It is forbidden for slaves to leave this room on pain of torture and death.
26106 := Please don't hurt me! I'll... I'll tell you everything I know. I only pray Davik doesn't find out, or my life will end in terrible agony.
26107 := Davik rarely lets us leave the slave quarters. We only know what we hear from Davik's guests. Recently they've all been talking about poor Hudrow.
26108 := He was caught trying to steal some spice from the lab. Normally Hudrow is allowed to get away with things like that because he's Davik's personal pilot for the Ebon Hawk.
26109 := But since the Sith have grounded every ship on the planet, Hudrow doesn't get anymore special treatment. They've locked him up in Davik's torture chambers.
26110 := Nothing - Davik keeps us locked away in here day and night. I'm not even certain of the location of the torture chamber where they've got Hudrow locked away.
26111 := I think you can get there through the hall behind the west door of Davik's throne room. Just keep going west from the slave quarters and you'll see the throne room. 
26112 := But Davik's certain to have guards patrolling the area. If you leave the guest wing, they'll shoot you on sight. Please - I don't know anything else.
26113 := There's no need to threaten these poor women. It's not their fault their life is like this.
26114 := [Failure] I won't betray Davik's secrets for credits; they are of no use to a slave. Is there something else I can do for you?
26115 := [Failure] I'm sorry, master, but the risk is too great. Davik will have me flayed alive if he finds out. Is there something else I may do to please you?
26116 := [Success] Praise from the guests is a valuable commodity here. Davik rewards the slaves who perform their duties well. I will tell you what I know.
26117 := Heh. Now this is my kind of place!
26118 := Welcome to the slave quarters, fair mistress. I mean no disrespect, but perhaps one of the male slaves could serve your needs better.
26119 := I'll be going now.
26120 := I'd love a massage right now.
26121 := Your job isn't finished yet. I want another massage!
26122 := That was pathetic!
26123 := It wasn't as fulfilling as I hoped. Something seemed to be lacking.
26124 := I'm telling Davik you're the worst slave I've ever seen!
26125 := I don't want to get you in trouble. Don't worry, I won't say anything.
26126 := I won't say anything if you answer my questions!
26127 := It was everything I ever dreamed. You are truly an expert in your craft.
26128 := I need some information.
26129 := Either you start talking, or I start blasting random body parts.
26130 := What else can you tell me?
26131 := Where is the torture chamber? 
26132 := Maybe 50 credits will get you talking.
26133 := [Persuade] Tell me what I want to know and I'll tell Davik how pleased I was with your performance.
26134 := I don't have time for that kind of thing right now. 
26135 := I greet you once more, mistress. How may this humble servant be of use to you?
26136 := Welcome to the slave quarters, mistress. Here we have succulent fruits and berries to tempt your palette, as well as luxurious baths to soothe your aches and pains.
26137 := Would you like a relaxing massage, mistress? Whatever your desire, we are here to serve.
26138 := Of course. Return whenever you wish to partake of what we offer here. We exist only to serve.

26143 := As... as you wish, mistress. It will not be the first time I have been punished by Davik.
26144 := I am sorry I have failed to please you, my lady. I will try to do better in the future. Is there anything else you require from this most unworthy servant?
26145 := I have no wish to be beaten by Davik, so I will tell you all I know. I hope it is enough to buy your mercy.
26146 := Thank you, my lady. I hope you will express your appreciation to Davik. He often rewards those slaves who perform their duties well. Is there anything else you require?
26147 := Come on. I mean... I love a massage as much as the next guy, but we're not exactly on vacation here. We need to get going.
26148 := But... what could I possibly tell you? It is forbidden for slaves to leave this room on pain of torture and death.
26149 := Please don't hurt me! I'll... I'll tell you everything I know. I only pray Davik doesn't find out, or my life will end in terrible agony.

26159 := Wow! This guy's gorgeous; Davik sure knows how to pick 'em!
26160 := Welcome to the slave quarters, good sir. I mean no disrespect, but perhaps one of the female slaves could serve your needs better.
26161 := I'll be going now.
26162 := I'd love a massage right now.
26163 := Your job isn't finished yet. I want another massage!
26164 := That was pathetic!
26165 := Let's just say you came up a little short of my expectations.
26166 := I'm telling Davik you're the worst slave I've ever seen!
26167 := I don't want to get you in trouble. Don't worry, I won't say anything.
26168 := I won't say anything if you answer my questions!

26175 := [Persuade] Tell me what I want to know and I'll tell Davik how pleased I was with your performance.
26176 := I don't have time for that kind of thing right now. 
26177 := Please... the pain. I can't take it anymore! Please help me. Please... just release me from this torture cage.
26178 := The button over there in the corner. Please - just press the button and set me free from this torture cage!
26179 := I've got information... the security codes for the Ebon Hawk. The ship is worth a fortune! I'll give them to you if you release me! Please... I'm begging you!
26180 := No! What kind of a monster are you? Please - they'll torture me until I'm dead! Don't leave me here!
26181 := Perhaps you should reconsider. His information may prove invaluable to us.
26182 := We may need that ship. Are you sure we shouldn't free him?
26183 := No way. I can't afford to trust anyone. Those codes are my only leverage - without them I'll never get out of here! Set me free, then I'll give you the codes.
26184 := Thank you! The button in the corner - just press it and I'll be free. Hurry!
26185 := My name is Hudrow. I used to be Davik's personal pilot until he caught me smuggling spice on the side. He threw me in here to be tortured to death! Please... I can't take much more of this!
26186 := Thank you! You have no idea what it was like in that torture cage. I don't know how much more I could take before going mad.
26187 := Please don't hurt me! I'll tell you everything I know - information worth a fortune! So just stay calm, okay? I'll tell you what I know. 
26188 := I used to be the pilot of the Ebon Hawk - Davik's flagship. I know the codes to disable the security system protecting it. I'll load them into your datapad now.
26189 := You can use those codes to steal the Ebon Hawk right out of its hangar. Sell it to the highest bidder, ransom it back to Davik - whatever you do you'll make thousands!
26190 := What? But... I don't have anything else! Those Ebon Hawk codes are worth a fortune! Isn't that enough? Please, just let me go.
26191 := You core-slime! I didn't survive through all that torture just to let you kill me!
26192 := We got what we came for. There is no need to indulge your appetite for violence.
26193 := Hey! There's no need for that. Just... just run, pal, before my friend here decides to start blasting.
26194 := Questions? Please - I've already told you the only useful thing I know. Just let me go before Davik figures out I'm missing.
26195 := It won't be long until Davik figures out I'm free. I have to get out of this base before that happens.
26196 := We should go now. We got what we needed.
26197 := We've got what we came for. We should get going.
26198 := I don't have anything to give you as a reward for freeing me. Nothing tangible, anyway. But I've got information that could be worth a fortune.
26199 := How can I release you?
26200 := Why should I help you?
26201 := I think I'll just leave you here.
26202 := Give me the codes, then I'll set you free.
26203 := Sure, I'll set you free.
26204 := ***Button Pressed*** (this dialog node will be changed to a simple end dialog when the button to open the cage is scripted)
26205 := Who are you?
26206 := Okay, you're free. Now give me my reward or I'll kill you myself!
26207 := So now that you're free there's the matter of a reward...
26208 := You better come up with more of a reward if you want to walk out of here alive!
26209 := You might warn the guards. I better just kill you.
26210 := Fine. Start running, then.
26211 := I'll do what I want. Don't interfere.
26212 := I want to ask you some questions.
26213 := Okay, you're free to go now.
26214 := I couldn't sit by and just let you suffer.

26268 := Ah, yes... feed the hatred and anger within yourself! Call upon the power of the dark side! But not even that can save you now.
26269 := You are a fool - this is a new age! The Sith shall be the ones passing judgment now! We are the new order of the galaxy!
26270 := Spoken like a true drone of the Jedi Council. We Sith, however, have learned to embrace the potential of the dark side. It is what gives us strength!
26271 := This meeting is a stroke of luck for me - my master will surely reward me with my lightsaber once I kill you!
26272 := I'm going to enjoy gutting you! 
26273 := You Sith must be brought to judgment for all the blood you have spilled.
26274 := Turn away from the dark side. It won't lead you to anything but destruction.
26275 := You know, it's about time someone stood up to these Sith! Just do me a favor and wait until I'm out of here before you start blasting the place up.
26276 := Hey - you can't come in here! This is a restricted area! You better tell me what you're doing or I'm going to hit the alarm!
26277 := Don't shoot! I just work here - I never wanted any part of this! I would have quit when the Sith took over, but they wouldn't let me!
26278 := You shouldn't threaten a girl who's got an alarm right at her desk!
26279 := [Failure] You must think I'm pretty stupid! If I take your bribe the Sith will have me executed! 
26280 := I don't know what you're up to, but I have the feeling it might get me in a lot of trouble. I hate to do this, but you'll have to explain yourself to the guards.
26281 := [Success] 50 credits? You've got a deal! The Sith have made my life a living hell ever since they took over this base.
26282 := [Failure] Nice try. What - you think that just because I'm pretty I'm also stupid? 
26283 := You better tell me why you're here or I'll hit this alarm and you'll have about three seconds before this office is swarming with Sith soldiers!
26284 := Touch that alarm and you're dead!
26285 := You're in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's bad luck, but I still have to kill you!
26286 := Okay - get out of here and I'll let you live!
26287 := [Persuade] Look, here's 50 credits - just don't hit that alarm.
26288 := [Persuade] I work here - look, I've got an access card.
26289 := [Persuade] I'm here for a meeting. Don't worry - I know where I have to go.

26343 := Okay, you hear that, scum? You get a reprieve. Now give us some information to make it worth it.
26344 := Yeah, sure. Whatever you want to know. Just don't hurt me, okay?
26345 := That Republic soldier? You don't think Brejik is dumb enough to leave a trophy like that in this scum hole, do you? He's taken her away somewhere safe.
26346 := But don't ask me where, 'cause I don't know. So, how 'bout it - if I unlock the elevator, are you going to let me go?
26347 := The accelerator? It's down in the garage. You have to take the security elevator in the back to get there, but the elevator is protected by a nest of blaster turrets.
26348 := You'll need a pass card to get by those cannons protecting the security elevator to the basement.
26349 := I don't know. Maybe you could use the main terminal in this room to override the security system, if you're good with computers. Otherwise you'll need to get your hands on a pass card.
26350 := Brejik's lieutenants carry them, and there might be an extra one in the barracks. But there's a small army in that room. Even you might have a tough time taking them all on at once.
26351 := You promise to let me go and I'll give you my elevator pass codes. You can use them to access the central elevator. It'll take you up to the second level.
26352 := That's where we've got all our processing labs. The raw spice up there is worth hundreds of credits. It's yours if you just promise to let me go.
26353 := You...you don't think he could be of help? I mean, why kill him?
26354 := Well, not that I object, really. I just... I'd rather not throw aside anything that could help us right now.
26355 := You mean... you're really going to let me live? Thanks - thanks a lot! And don't worry, I won't tip the other Vulkars off. My gang days are over. I never really liked serving under Brejik anyway.
26356 := Why? What's up on the second level?
26357 := Sorry, but I only fight to the death!
26358 := Fine, I suppose you're right.
26359 := Don't argue, Carth.
26360 := You better give me some information if you want to live.
26361 := I'm looking for a prisoner. A woman named Bastila.
26362 := Where can I find the prototype swoop engine accelerator?
26363 := Is there some way to disable the security cannons?
26364 := Where can I get a pass card?
26365 := How does unlocking the elevator help me?
26366 := I think I'll just kill you now.
26367 := Fine, I suppose you're right.
26368 := He can't help us anymore.
26369 := Don't argue. Let's just do this.
26370 := I want to ask you about something else.
26371 := Go on - get out of here before I change my mind.
26372 := Please don't hurt me - I just serve the food here, that's all! I'm not like these others - I'm not even a Black Vulkar. Please don't kill me!
26373 := No - I won't go out like this! Not after all I've been through! I won't just let you kill me without a fight!
26374 := No, no wait. This girl is no threat to us. Just run along, miss, and get out of here. And do it quickly before the Vulkars come back.
26375 := But I don't know anything! I'm just a prisoner here - a slave! The Vulkars don't tell me anything, they treat me like dirt, they beat me if I screw up their orders.
26376 := They don't even have the decency to give me warm clothes! I... I was able to bear it before. But ever since they turned the heat off in the compound I'm always so very cold. 
26377 := Is she that Republic soldier? I heard one of those Vulkar mention her, but she's not here. He said Brejik didn't trust his men around her.
26378 := I guess she's too important to be a slave here in the kitchens, getting pawed and groped and kicked and spit on like me. Brejik must have taken her somewhere safe.
26379 := What? I... I've never heard of such a thing. I guess it might be in the garage on the lower level - that's where all the Vulkars go to work on their swoop bikes.
26380 := But I've never been down there. The elevator is protected by a security system - only the Vulkars are allowed to go down there.
26381 := I overheard some of the Vulkars talking about the heating vents interfering with the thermal security cameras. That's all I know. 
26382 := You may know more than you think, miss. Help us and we'll help you, okay?
26383 := Well... alright. I still don't know how much help I can be. But I sure hope you get rid of all the Vulkars. I hate them!
26384 := My name is Ada. My father owed Davik some money, but he couldn't pay. Davik killed my father and sold me into slavery here at the Vulkar compound to pay off the debt.
26385 := Now that you've killed the guards who were supposed to watch me I think I could find my way out of here.
26386 := I... I'm free to go? You're not going to kill me? I... I don't know how I can ever repay you. Thank you! Thank you! I... I have to get out of here before any of the Vulkars see me.
26387 := Leaving you alive is too risky. Sorry, sister... looks like your order is up!
26388 := You better give me some information if you want to live.
26389 := I'm looking for a prisoner. A woman named Bastila.
26390 := Where can I find the prototype swoop engine accelerator?
26391 := Why did they turn the heat off in this place? 
26392 := Don't worry, I just want to ask you a few questions.
26393 := How did you end up here in the Vulkar base?
26394 := If I let you go can you find your way out of here?
26395 := Answer my questions and I'll let you go.
26396 := Hurry, then - get out of here.

26477 := You idiot! You can't just let them walk out of here! They might be a Bek spy after our spice!
26478 := Huh? Them be Bek spy? BEKS DIE NOW!!
26479 := Time for you to die!
26480 := [Persuade] I just want a quick look around. Will 20 credits calm you down?
26481 := [Persuade] I'm the new lab tech Brejik hired.
26482 := Sorry, I'll be going now. 
26483 := You again? If anyone catches you here they'll shoot first and ask questions later. Why aren't back on the north side where you mechanics belong?

26485 := [Failure] Lost, huh? Right. I bet you're here to steal some spice! You mechanics are all the same!
26486 := Brejik warned me I might have to protect myself from spice addicts looking to score - looks like he was right!
26487 := [Success] Another new mechanic? Brejik's gone crazy - he's hiring anyone who ever picked up a blast torch! 
26488 := Well, you can't just go wandering around the spice labs! All you mechanics have to stay on the north side of the floor- you should know that!
26489 := Looking for some spice, I'll bet! They warned me that a lot of you mechanics were addicts who would come snooping around looking for a fix.
26490 := No way! We lab techs aren't allowed to talk to you mechanics; too many of you are spice addicts looking to score. Brejik doesn't trust you guys.
26491 := Look, you should just go. This is my private room - there's nothing for you here. All the spice stays in the lab next door. Now get out of here or I'll have to call the guards.
26492 := Glad to see you're being reasonable.
26493 := I'm here to kill you. 
26494 := [Persuade/Lie] Sorry. I'm new here. I must have gotten lost.
26495 := I'm just looking around.
26496 := I want to ask you some questions.
26497 := How are you going to report me with a blaster hole in your chest?
26498 := Okay, I'm going. Don't get upset.
26499 := You ever tried this Tarisian extra-dark ale? It's very good - Brejik doesn't skimp on the refreshments around here - I'll give him that!
26500 := I'd offer you some, but I'm down to my last few sips. Mighty tasty stuff, though. A toast to Brejik!
26501 := Working for Brejik isn't a bad gig. The wages are good and he built this nice rec room for us to relax in - though I wish he'd let us leave the Vulkar base once in a while.
26502 := I'm surprised to see you here. Usually you lab techs don't mingle with us lowly mechanics. I'd offer you a drink, but this is my last bottle. Still, you're welcome to stick around.
26503 := Back again, rookie? How things going? Everyone treating you okay? Is there something you need?
26504 := Hey, there. Say - I don't recognize you... you must be one of those new lab techs, right? What are you doing over here on the mechanics' side of the building? You lost, rookie?
26505 := You think just 'cause I'm a nice old man I can't defend myself? You got another thing coming, punk!
26506 := No problem. I was always getting lost my first day too, rookie. I look forward to working with you. 
26507 := Hey, now... no need to be that way! Leave the violence to the Vulkar gang members, okay? We mechanics and lab techs are more civilized than that, right? 
26508 := If you've got a question, just ask. I'll be happy to help. Don't be shy - the only stupid question is the one you don't ask. At least, that's what they say.
26509 := Okay, then. If you need anything else, just come see me. I remember what it was like my first day.
26510 := There's nothing wrong with the heating system. Brejik just yanked the magnetic power cell out. All you have to do is pop that cell back in and the system is up and running again.
26511 := But until we figure out a way to make the heat work without disabling the thermal security system on the garage elevator, that cell's going to stay locked away in the Control Room.
26512 := That's a restricted area. Only people with authorization cards, like us mechanics, can get past the laser cannons guarding the service elevator.
26513 := Sure, I'll help you however I can. I remember what it was like my first day here.
26514 := Hey, now - that kind of talk won't win you many friends with the other lab techs! Of course, the Vulkar gang members might take a shine to you.
26515 := In any case, threatening me won't help you - I don't even have my card on me.
26516 := All mechanics have to store their authorization cards in the locker room when we're off duty. That's the rule. My own card is locked up right now - I put it away as soon as my shift was over. 
26517 := And I'm not about to lend my card out to anyone. You know how much trouble we can get into if Brejik finds out we aren't keeping our authorization cards properly secured?
26518 := Of course, not all the mechanics here follow the rules as closely as they should. I've even heard of a few guys trading their cards for a spice fix! Heh. Stupid addicts.
26519 := The accelerator? It's down in the garage, of course. The service elevator is the only way in. But you lab techs aren't allowed down there. 
26520 := Can't say I blame you. They don't tell you new hires much, do they? Heh. Just throw you in the deep end and expect you to swim. Terrible way to run things, if you ask me.
26521 := Time for you to die, old man!
26522 := Sorry... wrong room. I'll be going now. 
26523 := I need information, so start talking or I'll put a blaster hole in your chest!
26524 := I'll be going now.
26525 := What's wrong with the heat in this place?
26526 := How can I get past the security system protecting the garage service elevator on the first floor? 
26527 := I want to ask you something else.
26528 := Give me your authorization card or I'll kill you!
26529 := You better go get me that card if you want to live!
26530 := Where is your card?
26531 := Could I borrow your authorization card?
26532 := Where can I get a mechanic's authorization card? 
26533 := Where are they keeping that prototype swoop engine accelerator?
26534 := I want to ask you some questions.
26535 := Back again? You looking to pass the time until your next shift with some Pazaak?
26536 := Hey, there. You must be one of the new lab techs, right. You like Pazaak? It can be hard to find a game in this place.
26537 := Eh, we mechanics don't make the big bucks like you lab techs, but if we keep the stakes low I'm up for a match or two. You interested?
26538 := Well, if you ever feel like passing the time with a few harmless hands of low stakes Pazaak just let me know.
26539 := Hah! You're kidding, right? Like I'd be stupid enough to wager my authorization card! If Brejik found out I'd get fired - or worse! 
26540 := Sorry, but those stakes are too high for this working class guy's blood. I'll play, but only for small stakes. So what do you say, you interested?
26541 := Nothing kills time between shifts like a nice game of Pazaak, don't you agree? Okay, let's get this game started.
26542 := No? That's a real shame. You can't play unless you have your own deck, and I don't know anywhere around here for you to get one.
26543 := Well, if you ever get your hands on a Pazaak deck and you're looking to play a few hands you know where to find me.
26544 := Questions? Come on - I just got off a double shift. I'm here to relax and play cards, not to answer a bunch of questions. So how about it? You want to play? 
26545 := Looks like this guy just won herself a little extra spending credits on that last Pazaak hand - but it's not like you lab techs can't afford it, right? You want to play again?
26546 := You picked my pocket pretty good on that last Pazaak hand. You should give a working guy a break - we mechanics don't make the big bucks. Just kidding... You want to play again?
26547 := Sorry, I'm not interested right now.
26548 := I'll play you for your mechanic's authorization card. 
26549 := Sure, I'll play. 
26550 := I don't have a deck.
26551 := I guess I'll be going now.
26552 := I want to ask you some questions.
26553 := You again? What - you ready to work out a deal now? Listen, you get me some spice and I'll make it worth your while.
26554 := You... you're the new lab tech, right? Gotta be. You ain't no mechanic and you don't look like one of the Vulkar gang members. 
26555 := Listen, friend... I used to have a little deal with one of the gals in the lab. Whenever I needed some spice, she'd sneak a little bit out for me and I'd make it worth her while.
26556 := But she's gone now - Brejik found out she was dipping into his stash. Now my supplier is gone and I'm in bad need of a little fix. You follow what I'm saying?
26557 := Come on, don't be that way! I need some spice, you got access to spice! We can make an exchange that makes us all happy! 
26558 := You know, you lab techs think you're too good for the likes of us mechanics, but you're nothing but a bunch of selfish, greedy, arrogant Hutt-slugs!
26559 := Well, I don't need your help! I'll figure out some other way to get that spice. Go on - get out of here! Just leave me alone.
26560 := See, all you lab techs are so smart. You got it figured out already. Just a small bit of spice, no one will even notice. And I make it worth your while.
26561 := Here's the problem, see. I'm flat broke till next week. But I'm good for it. In fact, I'll even let you hold my mechanic's access card for collateral. How's that sound?
26562 := You see? I knew you were the type to answer the door when opportunity knocks! Wait here and I'll be right back with my access card.
26563 := You see? I knew you were the type to answer the door when opportunity knocks! As soon as you get the spice I'll go get my access card from my locker.
26564 := Th...that's us. New lab techs. You're a perceptive one.
26565 := So, you got something for me? Remember - as soon as you come up with the spice I'll go get my mechanic's access card for you to hold on to until next week when I get paid.
26566 := Changed your mind? You can't do that - we had a deal! You can't just back out of a deal!
26567 := Okay, let's do this deal quick. I don't want somebody to see us or we could both get in trouble.
26568 := Here's my mechanic's access card - don't lose it! As soon as I get paid I expect you to give me that card back.
26569 := Now if you'll excuse me, I need to find somewhere private to enjoy this spice.
26570 := Sorry, I'm not interested. 
26571 := Forget it.
26572 := You want me to steal some spice for you. 
26573 := How much will you give me?
26574 := Sorry, I'm not interested.
26575 := Forget it. Credits up front or no deal!
26576 := Here's the spice - now give me your access card.
26577 := I'll be back when I have the spice.
26578 := I've changed my mind. I'm not going to do this.

26603 := Area 001
26604 := Looks like we have visitors - lackeys conned by Gadon Thek into trying to steal Brejik's swoop engine accelerator, I bet!
26605 := Well I didn't go to all the trouble of acquiring this prototype just so you could steal it back for that old fool!
26606 := Would you like me to dispose of these Bek spies, Kandon?
26607 := No - hold on a second. I see you aren't wearing the Hidden Bek colors, so I'm guessing you aren't part of that feeble old man's gang. You must be a freelance mercenary. 
26608 := Instead of stealing the prototype for the Beks, why don't you come work for us? The Black Vulkars could use someone like you.
26609 := Be smart; Gadon Thek is old news! He's a blind fool in more ways than one! Brejik is a visionary - soon he'll control the entire Lower City! Don't shackle yourself to a losing team.
26610 := Brejik has grown tired of this petty war with Gadon and his pathetic followers. He needs someone to get rid of Gadon... permanently.
26611 := If you do this task for him Brejik is willing to offer a very substantial reward. How does 500 credits sound? Oh, and we'll throw in that young Republic soldier we captured, too.
26612 := Well... we can't just give the girl to you. Not after Brejik's publicly offered her up as a prize in the big swoop race. But we can do the next best thing.
26613 := Whoever wins the swoop race gets the girl. Kill Gadon and we'll give you 500 credits, sponsor you as a Vulkar rider and equip your swoop with the accelerator. You can't lose!
26614 := *Sigh* I can see there's not much chance of convincing you to come work for us after all. Most unfortunate.
26615 := Now can I kill them, Kandon?
26616 := Yes, darling. Kill them. Kill them all. 
26617 := Brejik can't withdraw his prize without losing the respect of every gang in the Lower City. Besides, she isn't even here. Brejik's keeping her somewhere safe until after the race.
26618 := Excellent. Here - you might need these for this mission. They're access codes to Gadon's private chambers in the Bek base. Without them you won't be able to get at the old man.
26619 := My guards will escort you to the main doors of our base. After you have killed Gadon return to the main doors and I will arrange for you to ride for the Vulkars in the swoop race.
26620 := I'd suggest you don't come back until the job is done, or we might think you've decided to renegotiate on our offer. The Vulkars won't consider you a friend until Gadon is dead.
26621 := Are you sure about this? I mean, I want to get Bastila back... but taking contracts to kill people is a bit much. Even if it is just more biker scum.
26622 := What? You can't betray Gadon! I won't let you!
26623 := Ah, Mission - the Hidden Bek's unofficial mascot! Your loyalty is admirable, but misplaced. Gadon only kept you around so they could laugh at you and your furry friend. 
26624 := No, that's not true! You're lying!
26625 := Am I? How long have you known Gadon? How long have you worked for him? But they never offered to make you a Hidden Bek, did they?
26626 := They... they said I was too young!
26627 := And you believed them? Come on, Mission. You're smarter than that. To Gadon and his crew you were nothing but a running joke. Weren't they always teasing you?
26628 := Well, yeah. Some of them were. But you Vulkars have tried to kill me more than once!
26629 := That's only because you were with the Hidden Beks - and because we respected you. Brejik knows you're not a joke, Mission. He made sure the Vulkars took you very, very seriously.
26630 := But... but Gadon said Brejik...
26631 := Gadon had to poison your mind against Brejik! It was the only way to keep you from seeing the truth. The Beks were mocking you, Mission. You don't need friends like that.
26632 := You're right! I don't need anyone but Zaalbar! If Gadon dies, he's only getting what's coming to him!
26633 := You're talking like Brejik didn't steal that engine, himself, to begin with!
26634 := Brejik stole that engine from Gadon! It was never yours to begin with!
26635 := I've heard the news - Gadon is dead. You have done well. Brejik himself would be here to congratulate you if he was not so busy preparing for the big swoop race.
26636 := Don't do anything foolish. If you attack me then you'll lose any chance of ever getting your hands on that girl. Besides, we had a deal, remember?
26637 := Here are the 500 credits for eliminating Gadon and, as promised, we will let you ride for the Black Vulkars in the big swoop race.
26638 := We'll provide you with a swoop bike that has the prototype accelerator installed. Your modified bike will be fast enough to beat every other racer on the track.
26639 := When you win Brejik will turn the girl over to you. You get Bastila, a Vulkar rider wins the race, and Brejik doesn't lose face for withdrawing his prize. Everybody wins.
26640 := Who will sponsor you then, the Beks? I'm sure they'd love to back the assassin who killed their beloved leader. No, I think you'll race for us - you don't have any other options.
26641 := There is one small thing you should be aware of before you race tomorrow: the prototype accelerator isn't exactly stable yet - there's a chance it might explode during the race.
26642 := That's part of the reason Brejik installed it on your bike - none of our Vulkar riders are willing to risk their lives to win the prize. They're afraid of getting blown to bits.
26643 := I'm glad to see you're being reasonable. The race is tomorrow, so I'm afraid you won't have time to practice. But nobody will be able to keep up with your modified swoop.
26644 := All you have to do is hold on tight, try not to smash into anything, and hope the accelerator doesn't explode. Simple.
26645 := Get some rest and I'll come for you in the morning to take you to the swoop track. Good luck... you're going to need it.
26646 := You've already gone to a great deal of trouble to get your hands on this Bastila. You want this Republic soldier in your possession for some reason.
26647 := I don't know why - I really don't care. But I get the feeling you're willing to risk dying on the swoop bike if that's what it takes to get her.
26648 := Explode? Are...are you crazy? Why would we risk riding that thing, then?
26649 := And when we win the race, we get Bastila, right?
26650 := Forget it! I know all about you Black Vulkars!
26651 := You've got my attention. What's your offer?
26652 := Brejik will let me have Bastila if I kill Gadon for him?
26653 := I thought she was being offered up as the prize in the swoop race.
26654 := How about I just kill you instead?
26655 := Forget it - I'm not going to betray Gadon!
26656 := Just give me the girl now or we have no deal.
26657 := Forget it. I want Bastila up front or no deal!
26658 := Okay, we have a deal. I'll kill Gadon for you.
26659 := Don't listen to him, Mission. He's twisting your mind!
26660 := You were about to tell me your offer, Kandon.
26661 := Gadon died screaming like a skinned ronto. So will you if you don't hand over Bastila right now!
26662 := I've done my part, now you better live up to your end of the bargain!
26663 := I've changed my mind - I'm not racing for you!
26664 := Okay, let's do this.
26665 := I guess I don't have any choice. I'll race for the Vulkars.
26666 := I'm not afraid to ride that bike!
26667 := Why do you think I'm willing to risk my life?
26668 := Why do I get the feeling you're not telling me something?

26742 := Give me the passcard for the Sith Base.
26743 := Give me the rakghoul serum.
26744 := Give me 10000 credits.
26745 := Back again? At least this time Zaerdra didn't verbally assault you for coming to see me.
26746 := I trust her with my life, but she does take her guard duties rather seriously ever since this war with Brejik and the Vulkars began. Now, what do you need from me?
26747 := You have returned. Do you have the prototype swoop engine accelerator with you?
26748 := I suggest you hurry. The swoop race is coming up, and we want you to have time to practice before the race.
26749 := Time is running out, you know. If you don't come up with that accelerator you won't have a chance against the Vulkars in the swoop race.
26750 := If you want to save this Bastila then you better get that accelerator back from the Vulkars.
26751 := I was beginning to wonder if you would make it. The race is tomorrow, and my mechanics need time to install the prototype into the swoop engine of our bike.
26752 := A reward? I'm blind, but I'm not stupid. Your reward is the chance to ride in the big swoop race so you can win Bastila's freedom.
26753 := We had a deal, so I expect you to honor it. If we don't honor our deals, what's to stop me from just taking the prototype from you and leaving you for dead?
26754 := Don't worry, I'm a man of my word. I promised you could ride in the swoop race under the Hidden Bek banner, and I'm still going to let you do that.
26755 := And I'm even going to go one better - I'm going to let you ride the swoop bike with the prototype accelerator installed on it. Without it, you won't stand a chance.
26756 := Gadon! You can't be serious! We need one of our best riders on that bike! We can't let some rookie take the prototype engine into the race! 
26757 := I have to be honest with you - there's a reason I'm letting you take the prototype engine. The accelerator isn't stable; there's a good chance it could explode during the race.
26758 := I can't ask one of my own riders to take the risk - they'll be running unmodified swoops in the race. You'll be the only one using the prototype.
26759 := If you can complete the track before the accelerator overheats then you'll win for the Beks. If you die, then one of my other riders could still come through for me.
26760 := Without that prototype you don't stand a chance of winning. And if you don't win you can't get Bastila back - none of the other riders will give her up. This is your only chance.
26761 := You can stay here tonight. The mechanics need time to install the accelerator on the engine, so you won't be able to practice your riding.
26762 := But I've got good instincts, and you have the look of a racer about you. Just try to relax and in the morning we'll take you to the swoop track.
26763 := You don't get to be leader of a swoop gang if you don't know how to work all the angles.
26764 := You'll have to forgive Zaerdra. Ever since Brejik and the Vulkars began this war against us, she's been a little over-zealous in her security duties. 
26765 := The problems with the Sith haven't helped things. Zaerdra seems to forget that I know how to look after myself! Now, how can I help you?
26766 := Feel free to come back anytime. We're not like those Vulkar savages - strangers are welcome in the Bek base. 
26767 := I don't see any harm in that. What did you want to know?
26768 := Not while the Sith quarantine is in place. Even the fastest smugglers' ships can't break the blockade of the fleet surrounding the planet without the proper launch codes.
26769 := Any ship leaving the Taris atmosphere without the proper codes would be instantly disintegrated by blaster cannons fired by the Sith fleet's automated targeting systems.
26770 := How dare you?! I should kill you where you stand!
26771 := Calm down, Zaerdra... I'm not ashamed of what I have become. As you can see, I lost my eyes in a swoop racing crash. I rely on these artificial replacements to see now.
26772 := But my blindness was not the worst consequence of my accident. My affliction was what eventually led to this war between my Beks and the Vulkars.
26773 := When I lost my sight in the swoop bike accident everyone assumed I would step down as leader of the Hidden Beks and let Brejik - my most trusted follower - take over.
26774 := But with my occular implants I can still see well enough to lead this gang, and I knew Brejik wasn't ready to take over yet. Unfortunately, Brejik didn't agree with me. 
26775 := In a rage he left to join our arch rivals, the Black Vulkars. A lot of the younger gang members followed him, and soon he and his followers had taken control of the Vulkar gang.
26776 := Brejik is a proud man. My decision was a public humiliation for him. Maybe if I had stepped down this gang war could have been avoided. 
26777 := Don't fool yourself, Gadon. Brejik wants to control the Lower City gangs. If you'd stepped down, he'd have led the Beks against the Vulkars. He wanted this war, one way or another.
26778 := *sigh* I know you're right, Zaerdra. Brejik won't rest until I am dead and the Beks are no more, but it's hard to accept the truth of his betrayal.
26779 := Uh, very tactful. Are you itching for a fight or something?
26780 := Your time would probably be better spent going after the prototype swoop engine the Vulkars stole from us, but I'll answer your questions if I can.
26781 := Are you crazy? The Vulkars shoot people on sight in the streets! Why would you be stupid enough to try and get inside their base?
26782 := Think about it, Zaerdra: the Republic officer the Vulkars captured; all the escape pods crashing on Taris; an off-worlder desperate to get inside the Vulkar base. It's obvious.
26783 := Of course! You're a soldier who survived the crash! That's why you want into the base - to rescue that Republic officer before Brejik sells her to some intergalactic slaver!
26784 := The escape pods? You know, I heard the Sith have been asking around the Upper City about them as well... but you don't look like you're with the Sith.
26785 := They might be spies, Gadon! They might be working for the Sith!
26786 := Calm down, Zaerdra. If the Sith thought we knew anything useful they'd have a battalion of troops kicking down our door. No, I think this offworlder has his own agenda.
26787 := I suppose I could tell you what I know. It's not like it could do any harm to me or my gang... but it might cause problems for the Vulkars, and that's okay in my book.
26788 := The Vulkars stripped those pods clean within hours after they landed. It's too bad we didn't get there first, considering what my spies reported the Vulkars found.
26789 := A female Republic officer named Bastila survived the crash. We Beks don't believe in intergalactic slavery, but the Vulkars aren't so picky. They took her prisoner.
26790 := Normally the Vulkars would take a captured slave and sell them for a nice profit to Davik or an off-world slaver. But a Republic officer is no ordinary catch.
26791 := She's too valuable to leave with the Vulkar scum at the base. Brejik's probably got your Republic friend hidden away somewhere safe until the big swoop race. You'll never find her.
26792 := I'm afraid your friend has become a pawn in Brejik's game to take over the Lower City. He's offered her up as the Vulkar's share of the prize in the annual swoop gang race.
26793 := By putting up such a valuable prize Brejik hopes to win the loyalty of some of the smaller gangs. Their numbers will allow him to finally destroy me and my followers.
26794 := The only hope you have of rescuing Bastila is to somehow win the big season opener of the swoop race.
26795 := I might be able to help you with this, if you'd be willing to help us. We both have something to gain here - and much to lose.
26796 := You really don't have any other choice. Not if you want to get Bastila back. You should at least listen to what I have to say.
26797 := You're in no position to bargain here. Without my help, you don't have a hope of getting this Bastila back. You should at least listen to what I have to say.
26798 := The swoop race is for the Lower City gangs only. I could sponsor you as a rider for the Hidden Beks this year. If you win the race, you'll win your friend's freedom. 
26799 := But first you have to do something for me. My mechanics have developed an accelerator for a swoop engine. A bike with the accelerator installed can beat any other swoop out there! 
26800 := But the Vulkars stole the prototype from us. They plan to use it to guarantee a victory in this year's swoop race. I need you to break into their base and steal it back.
26801 := Don't be a fool. You have to win the swoop race to save your friend, and that means breaking into the Vulkar base and getting my prototype accelerator back.
26802 := My word is my bond. Everybody in the Lower City knows my reputation. Besides, you really don't have a choice. I'm your only ticket into the swoop race.
26803 := Getting into the Vulkar base won't be easy - the front doors are locked tight. But I know someone who might be able to get you in the back way - Mission Vao.
26804 := Mission? Gadon, you can't be serious! She's just a kid - how is she supposed to help them with this?
26805 := Mission's explored every step of every back alley in the Lower City. Plus she knows the Undercity sewers better than anyone. If anyone can get inside the Vulkar base, it's her.
26806 := Don't underestimate Mission or her Wookiee friend Zaalbar. They're a formidable pair; tough enough to go exploring the Undercity by themselves!
26807 := She and her Wookiee friend Zaalbar are always looking to stir up a little excitement. They like to go exploring in the Undercity, despite the dangers.
26808 := Your best bet is to look for her in the Undercity. But you'll need some way past the Sith guard post at the elevator. 
26809 := A simple disguise might have worked on the Upper City guard, but the security down here is much tougher. You'll need the proper papers to get past him.
26810 := Luckily my gang ambushed one of the Sith patrols headed down to the Undercity. They never made it, and their security papers fell into my hands.
26811 := Since we're working together now I suppose I could give them to you in exchange for your uniforms. With the security papers you won't need a disguise anyway.
26812 := Good choice. Thanks for the uniforms. You won't need them with these security papers anyway. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?
26813 := I like to be prepared. Eventually the Sith are going to try to drive us out of the Undercity. Sith disguises might give my people the edge we need in a crucial battle!
26814 := The disguise won't help you get into the Undercity. Besides, soon the Sith will realize they've got a few too many uniforms missing and the only way to get around will be the security papers.
26815 := So how do you propose we go about rescuing Bastila, then? We can't fight all the gangs.
26816 := Slavers everywhere. As if it was just another trade.
26817 := A foreign army invades Taris, declares martial law and locks down all travel to and from the planet? You damn well bet I have a problem with that!
26818 := If the Sith ever moved in down here all the swoop gangs would unite against them. We'd use hit and run guerrilla tactics to pick them off... their casualties would be enormous!
26819 := But so far the Sith have stayed out of the Lower City and our strength is wasted on this stupid gang war! I tried to explain this to Brejik, but he and his Vulkars won't listen.
26820 := Don't fool yourself. The Sith would never commit to that kind of operation. They'd... they'd probably do something much more grand and deadly.
26821 := Zaerdra tells me you have the swoop engine accelerator. This is excellent news.
26822 := I'll be back when I get the prototype accelerator.
26823 := I don't have it yet.
26824 := I have the accelerator right here.
26825 := Not so fast, Gadon. I want a reward for recovering this.
26826 := Okay, I see your point.
26827 := Okay, I lived up to my end of the deal. Now you better come through!
26828 := Zaerdra's right, Gadon. One of your own riders should get that swoop bike.
26829 := Why are you doing this, Gadon?
26830 := Don't worry, Gadon - I'll win that race!
26831 := Suddenly I'm not so sure about this.
26832 := Okay, I'm ready for the race.
26833 := Sounds like you've got all your bases covered.
26834 := Where can I find Mission again?
26835 := I'll be going now.
26836 := I want to ask you some questions.
26837 := Is there any way off this planet?
26838 := Why are Brejik and the Vulkars at war with you?
26839 := What's up with your freaky eyes, old man?
26840 := I want to ask you something else.
26841 := What do you mean?
26842 := Sounds like Brejik is acting like a spoiled brat.
26843 := But why start a gang war with the Beks?
26844 := You said you were having problems with the Sith?
26845 := I need to get inside the Black Vulkar base.
26846 := I need information on those Republic escape pods that crashed in the Undercity.
26847 := Do you know anything about this or not?
26848 := I have to get in there and rescue her!
26849 := Bastila's a slave? What will happen to her now?
26850 := Swoop race? What does that have to do with it?
26851 := But I don't even have a swoop bike.
26852 := How do I enter this swoop race?
26853 := Gadon - can you help me with this?
26854 := How do I know I can trust you?
26855 := I don't work with gangs, Gadon.
26856 := I might help you... if the price is right.
26857 := What are you proposing?
26858 := Forget it - I'm not interested.
26859 := How do I know you'll live up to your end of the bargain?
26860 := How am I supposed to get inside the Vulkar base?
26861 := Isn't there someone else who can help me?
26862 := Where can I find Mission?
26863 := I got past the Upper City guard no problem.
26864 := I've got some Sith uniforms to disguise myself.
26865 := Okay - I'll trade the uniforms for the papers.
26866 := What do you want with the Sith uniforms?
26867 := Forget it - I'm not giving up my disguise!
26868 := There has to be some way I can help her!
26869 := Don't worry... I'm not working for the Sith.
26870 := You have problems with the Sith?
26871 := Hey, you can't be in here right now - the control room is off limits! Don't you know there's a Vulkar assassin coming here to kill Gadon? 
26872 := Assassin! Assassin in the base!
26873 := Wait a minute - how did you even get in here? Nobody's supposed to have the access codes to this door. Unless... 
26874 := I'm the Vulkar assassin - time for you to die!
26875 := Sorry, I didn't know. I'll be going now.
26876 := Keep your eyes open. Our sources tell us Brejik's planning a hit on Gadon. There could be a Vulkar assassin in here right now! 
26877 := If you see anything suspicious, report it to one of the guards.
26878 := Assassin! Assassin in the base! Attack!
26879 := He's in his private chambers. He won't be coming out until we find that Vulkar assassin!
26880 := I'll be going now.
26881 := I'm the Vulkar assassin - time for you to die!
26882 := Where is Gadon now?
26883 := With Brejik dead it won't be long until those Vulkars of his collapse. I bet within a week Gadon will have the Lower City back to normal.
26884 := If the Vulkar's hadn't stolen our swoop engine prototype we'd be a lock to win the big race this year!
26885 := We should have wiped the Vulkars out long ago, but Gadon Thek thought he could reason with Brejik and prevent a war. Guess we know better now.
26886 := I can't believe that traitor Brejik used to be one of us. Gadon may be old and blind, but I'd rather follow him than a turncoat like Brejik!
26887 := Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the big swoop race! 
26888 := Best swoop race I've seen in years! I couldn't believe it was your first race! You've got real talent, rookie!
26889 := I don't deal in slaves, but that Republic soldier Brejik's offering as a prize would be worth a lot of credits to the right buyer.
26890 := The Vulkars won't last long against us now that Brejik's out of the way. Serves him right for trying to back out on his wager!
26891 := The Vulkars are out of control. Gang rivalry is one thing, but gunning people down in the streets is going too far! They don't even care if their victims are Beks or not!
26892 := The Vulkars are gaining members every day from the smaller gangs. If they win the big swoop race there's no telling how many new recruits they'll get!
26893 := Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the big swoop race! 
26894 := I can't believe what Brejik did after the race - talk about no class! But what else could you expect from a Vulkar?
26895 := You heard what the Vulkars are putting up as a prize to the winner of the swoop race? A captured Republic soldier! Do you know how much she'd bring on the galactic slaver market?
26896 := The Vulkars are done for! Nobody will want to join them after seeing what Brejik did at the swoop race!
26897 := The Vulkars aren't the first group to try and take over from the Beks. Gadon knows how to deal with these upstarts. He may be blind, but he still can see the big picture.
26898 := Used to be everyone wanted to join the Hidden Beks. But if the Vulkars win that swoop race I got a funny feeling a lot of our own people are going to join up with Brejik.
26899 := The conquering hero returns! You did a great thing winning that swoop race for us!
26900 := Membership in the Beks is already starting to climb again. Won't be long now until we're back in control and Gadon can restore some order to the streets.
26901 := It isn't safe out there on the streets. Those Black Vulkars will take a shot at anybody!
26902 := The swoop race coming up will show those Vulkars who's in charge here! When we win half the people following Brejik will desert him!
26903 := Brejik is nothing but scum! I don't know why those Vulkars follow him - Gadon's ten times the man he is!
26904 := Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the swoop race! 
26905 := You better be careful out on the streets. Those damn Vulkars will be looking to get even with you for winning that race and killing Brejik.
26906 := It's Zaerdra here. I hope you're reading me. Your swoop run is about to begin. Remember: just hold on tight and try not to smash into anything.
26907 := The prototype accelerator should last about 60 seconds before it overheats and explodes; that should be enough time for you to finish your run. Good luck, the Beks are counting on you!
26908 := You can speak to Gadon if you want, but I've got my eye on you! You try anything and you'll be vaporized before you can say "Vulkar spy"!
26909 := On behalf of Gadon, I want to offer the thanks of all the Hidden Beks. You rode like a true champion in the swoop race.
26910 := I'm sorry Gadon can't be here to thank you in person, but he has retired to the safety of his private chambers. I'm afraid he's grieving over Brejik's death.
26911 := Brejik violated the customs and traditions of Taris. He dishonored himself by refusing to honor his wager. He got what he deserved - even Gadon has to realize that.
26912 := Even so, I think Gadon hoped that somehow Brejik could be made to realize the error of his ways. Despite everything he had done, Gadon probably would have forgiven him.
26913 := Gadon always was too soft on Brejik. I just wish I'd been there when that scum got what was coming to him!
26914 := Even so, I think Gadon hoped that somehow Brejik could be made to realize the error of his ways. Despite everything he had done, Gadon probably would have forgiven him.
26915 := Brejik violated the customs and traditions of Taris. He dishonored himself by refusing to honor his wager. He got what he deserved - even Gadon has to realize that.
26916 := But he isn't out of danger yet. The survivng Vulkars will still want him dead. He's a prime target now - as are you. You better be careful out on the streets.
26917 := Gadon sounds like the kind of person who you'd want in charge down here. At least to me.
26918 := Gadon always was too soft on Brejik. I just wish I'd been there when that scum got what was coming to him!
26919 := Gadon can't speak to you right now. Brejik's put a price on his head, so I ordered him to stay in his private chambers until we find the assassin.
26920 := I knew we couldn't trust you!
26921 := Yes. Good. The more people who keep an eye out, the better we'll catch this assassin in time.
26922 := You have the accelerator? This is excellent news! I'll send for Gadon right way!
26923 := Hold it right there - who are you and what is your business with Gadon?
26924 := Calm down, Zaerdra. Nobody is going to try anything here in the middle of our own base. It would be a suicide mission.
26925 := You're too trusting, Gadon. Brejik and his Vulkars want you dead. Anyone we don't know is a potential threat, and it's my job to make sure you're safe!
26926 := Do you want us to start attacking strangers on sight, Zaerdra - like the Vulkars do? I will never let it come to that! Now step aside and let them pass.
26927 := As you wish. 
26928 := I hope Gadon doesn't blame me for Brejik's death.
26929 := But Brejik betrayed him!
26930 := I'm the assassin - time to die!
26931 := If I see anything suspicious I'll let you know.
26932 := I've got the prototype accelerator to give him.

26963 := You're too trusting, Gadon. These must be the assassins Brejik sent! How else did they get in here?
26964 := We're under attack! Guards! Guards!
26965 := [Failure] Liar! The guards would have announced you! Gadon - we've been betrayed again!
26966 := Time for you to die, old man!

26978 := You are back. Please, have you sold the plate I gave you? My children and I are counting on the credits.
26979 := Please hurry. The credits are all we have to start again.
26980 := You have? Did Fazza give a good price? How much did you get for us?
26981 := What? But... but I trusted you! How can you stand there and... and... No, I won't give you the satisfaction. 
26982 := What... what do you mean? My husband was sure it was worth 500 credits. He was so proud...
26983 := [Success] Half is acceptable to me. I... I agree?
26984 := [Failure] No... no I think you lie. If you are trying to cheat me at least have the guts to admit it.
26985 := [Success] I guess I don't have much choice, do I? I have to take it.
26986 := I see. I suppose I should thank you for not stealing it all... but I won't. You have no conscience.
26987 := I hope it will be enough. Goodbye. I hope we never meet again.
26988 := Please, will you help me? I have nothing. Nothing left.
26989 := I am no beggar! I just need a little help, is all. There is no one for me to turn to on this wretched planet.
26990 := I'll try not to take too much of your time. I realize that everyone is out for themselves on Tatooine.
26991 := Oh thank you. I don't have anywhere else to turn. If you are down-and-out on Tatooine, you're on your own.
26992 := My husband was a hunter... killed out on the dunes. This wraid plate is all I have left. Please, will you buy it?
26993 := I don't need a handout. I just can't sell it to Fazza without a license. Please, I'm worried about having it. They are so rare...
26994 := Please, will no one help? We need the credits. We have nothing.
26995 := I still can't believe he's gone. What do you want to know?
26996 := Nobody saw anything, and most of the other hunters never even knew him. He had just started.
26997 := I don't trust any of them, but those Gamorreans... they just laugh when they see me. I think they did it.
26998 := I can't say I'm not grateful, but it doesn't change my situation. I still need credits to get my family out of here.
26999 := It doesn't matter. There's no justice on Tatooine. I don't care what happens to them. I just need credits.
27000 := I've got to think about my family, not those vicious pigs.
27001 := No justice. Makes you wonder sometimes if the Republic even exists at all, out here.
27002 := I don't know if I could let it drop so easy.
27003 := His name is... was Ward Fizark. He used to work in the mines but they were scaled back last year.
27004 := He was new to hunting, but he was a good fighter. Used to be a soldier. We spent everything on his gear.
27005 := After a few trips he didn't come back. Guards say a sandcrawler crew found his body stripped of everything.
27006 := We spent everything on my husband's hunting gear. We hoped that the sport would support us. We hoped...
27007 := Whoever killed him took everything. All I have left is this desert wraid plate... we thought we were so lucky when he brought it home...
27008 := If I could sell it the kids and I could get out of here, maybe buy passage to Coruscant... I don't know.
27009 := It's the bone plate from the head of the desert wraid. My husband was so proud that he found it. He had just started hunting.
27010 := He said he felt sure the next hunt would bring in more, so we waited to sell this one. Then he never came back.
27011 := No? But you looked... I'm sorry, I thought you looked equipped like a hunter. Are you sure you aren't going to be getting a license?
27012 := I mean, you don't look like a farmer, and the only way to be allowed out of Anchorhead is to get a hunting license.
27013 := Czerka Corporation sells them in their office just south of here in the center of Anchorhead. That's where my husband got his.
27014 := I think they charge 200 credits... but they have been known to make exceptions. Please... no one else will help.
27015 := I wouldn't have any idea who to trust. My husband didn't know most of them... he wasn't a proven hunter yet.
27016 := I think one of them killed him. I have my suspicions. I'd rather trust a newcomer like you.
27017 := Will you help after? I'll try to answer what I can.
27018 := Will you buy it? I can't sell it myself. They are worth more than 500 credits!
27019 := What? Please, tell me you are kidding. I can't get any lower than this, and you would take advantage?
27020 := [Failure] No! No I won't! What are you doing? Please, don't do this to me!
27021 := [Success] I... I will give you the plate now... here, take it. What... what did you make me do?
27022 := You... you have no conscience. That plate is all I had... we're trapped here now... all because of you.
27023 := Darkness take you... monster...
27024 := Please no! Take it then... but you may as well have killed me. You've trapped us here... we have nothing.
27025 := Warning: Back off, female! No one lays hands on the personage of the master!
27026 := My, my. You should be proud of yourself, outwitting her like that.
27027 := Back off, old man. I thought you were the non-involved type, remember?
27028 := You should not act this way. You are treading a dangerous path I fear.
27029 := This is beneath even you, stealing from a helpless woman. How could you?!
27030 := Why did you do that?! It's not like we're badly in need of credits, for crying out loud.
27031 := I... I don't know. How could I be sure you would come back? Are you sure you can't buy it? Please?
27032 := [Success] I... I trust you. Take the plate and sell it. I will wait for you here.
27033 := Was that really necessary? I hope you intend to keep your word if you act so forcefully with an innocent.
27034 := [Failure] I'm sorry, but I can't take the chance. Are you sure you can't buy it from me?
27035 := [Success] I guess I don't have much choice in the matter. Here, I'll trust you with it.
27036 := I'll be here. Please, don't take too long. I need the credits. Maybe we can get started again... maybe.
27037 := You will? Oh, thank you so much. Please, I know it is worth at least 500 credits. 
27038 := 700 credits! Oh, thank you. It is more than generous of you. I don't know what to say. I just don't.
27039 := Thank you. I hope it is enough. You have been a great help. I appreciate it. My children will too.
27040 := For whatever it means, may the Force be with you. You've saved us.
27041 := *sigh* And how many more like you are there out there, with no one to buy their plates, I wonder?
27042 := Thank you for helping this woman. It may not seem like such a great thing to you, but you are making a difference.
27043 := Cheaper? Please, it is all I have. I need the credits. Can't you pay the 500?
27044 := [Success] Half is acceptable to me. I... I agree?
27045 := [Failure] No, please, I need the full 500. I have a family... we have nothing.
27046 := [Success] I guess I don't have much choice, do I? I have to take it.
27047 := It... it will have to do. I thank you, I guess. Maybe... maybe it's enough...
27048 := I don't know what to do then. We need the credits desperately. Could you get it? I could wait... 
27049 := I haven't sold it yet. I'll come back.
27050 := Yes, I have sold the plate.
27051 := I got a good price. You get nothing.
27052 := The plate wasn't worth as much as you said.
27053 := Actually, I'm mistaken. I'll come back.
27054 := [Force Persuade] It was only worth half what you said.
27055 := [Persuade/Lie] He was wrong. I swear it was only worth half.
27056 := Take half and stay healthy, understand?
27057 := He paid full value. Here. It's all yours.
27058 := He paid 200 more than you thought. Here.
27059 := I have no time for beggars.
27060 := Speak, I'm listening.
27061 := What do you need? I'm <FullName>, I'll help if I can.
27062 := I have to go. Goodbye.
27063 := I want to ask about your husband's death.
27064 := Any leads on who killed him?
27065 := Well, that's no longer a problem. I killed them.
27066 := You aren't looking for vengeance?
27067 := Who was he? Tell me about him.
27068 := Why do you need the money?
27069 := What is a wraid plate? Where did you get it?
27070 := I wouldn't be able to sell it. I'm no hunter.
27071 := No, I don't have the time. Go away.
27072 := Where would I get a license? What's the cost?
27073 := Aren't there other hunters you could ask?
27074 := Let's go back to my other questions.
27075 := Let's talk about what to do with this plate.
27076 := I think I'll just take it from you.
27077 := [Force Persuade] You will give it to me now!
27078 := Hand it over or things will get very unpleasant.
27079 := I can't buy it, but I could take it and sell it for you.
27080 := [Force Persuade] You trust me. You will give me the plate to sell.
27081 := [Persuade] It's the only choice you have. Trust me.
27082 := Perhaps I will buy it from you.
27083 := I've changed my mind. I'm leaving.
27084 := I'll pay that, and an extra 200. Good luck.
27085 := I will pay you what you want. Here. 
27086 := Can I persuade you to go cheaper? Maybe half?
27087 := [Force Persuade] Half is acceptable. You agree.
27088 := [Persuade] Look, half is better than nothing, right?
27089 := I can't afford it right now.
27090 := Hello again? Is there something else you wanted? I really have to get back to work.
27091 := Something you want? I don't have a lot of time for talk, so please make it quick.
27092 := All right then. Back to work, I guess.
27093 := Uh, is there some kind of a problem? I'm just doing my job, I don't want any trouble from you.
27094 := Hey... why are you threatening me? I just repair the crawlers. It's not like I'm packing away the credits.
27095 := Is there a point to this? This man is no danger to us.
27096 := I don't need this. What are you trying to prove?
27097 := What do you want? Credits? Here, take some! Just leave me alone. I've got work to do.
27098 := [Success] I suppose I do like you. Here's a few creds. Was there something else?
27099 := [Failure] Look, you can just get lost, all right? I have to get the crawlers ready for the morning.
27100 := Don't need some crazy surge-slime threatening me. Got Sand People for that. Hmph!
27101 := [Success] What, is this a mugging or are you begging? Look, here's a few creds, now leave me alone.
27102 := Hmm? All right, but I'm not sure what I could say to interest you. I just work on the crawlers.
27103 := Hey... aren't you a swoop-jock? I can't help with bike problems. I work with the heavy stuff.
27104 := Of course, I always have time for a pretty face... any face, really. What do you need?
27105 := Well, it's a hole in the galaxy, as far as I'm concerned. I doubt this outpost will last much longer.
27106 := But, that's happened before and will happen again. Anchorhead has been resettled a few times now.
27107 := No one is. I guess it looked like a promising mining planet, but the metal... I tell you, it just isn't right.
27108 := I've been a mechanic my whole life, and I've never seen anything corrode as fast as Tatooine metal.
27109 := It's why whoever was here before left, and why Czerka will leave, and why whoever comes next will leave.
27110 := Well, Tatooine fools people. It looks like it might have a good supply of resources, but it doesn't.
27111 := Before a company learns this, they've already set up communities to support operations they now can't afford.
27112 := Company pulls out, cities dry up, and after a few years, someone that doesn't know why it failed tries again.
27113 := I repair the sandcrawlers when they return from the mines. They get pretty banged up, even without the attacks.
27114 := I guess they have been happening a lot less frequently lately. If you did have anything to do with that, thanks.
27115 := I hope Czerka paid you well for it. Whatever it was, it wouldn't have been enough for me.
27116 := Have you? Not many hunters have tried in the past. Good luck to you, is all I can say. The Sand People are vicious.
27117 := I see the damage on the crawlers when they come back... if they come back.
27118 := I have no idea. I don't go out on the desert if I can help it. I'm sure the Sand People will find you if you walk far enough.
27119 := The Sand People attack them pretty regularly. Czerka Corporation is getting pretty sick of it, I hear.
27120 := They have offered bounties on Sand People for a while now, but few hunters take them up on it. Too dangerous.
27121 := Oh, the big crawlers head out at dawn. That's so they avoid the bigger predators. The wraid, I mean.
27122 := Doesn't help avoid the Sand People though. They attack pretty regular, no matter what Czerka Corporation tries.
27123 := Try at the Czerka offices right here. They'd know.
27124 := You again? Oh no, you can just keep walking. I'm not dealing with you again.
27125 := Nothing. Goodbye.
27126 := I'll take however long I want. Understand?
27127 := I think you're my problem. Maybe I should do something about it.
27128 := Maybe I don't like your face. Maybe I should remove it!
27129 := [Force Persuade] I'm not a threat. You like me and want to give me credits.
27130 := [Persuade] I'll leave you alone... for a few credits.
27131 := I just want to ask some questions.
27132 := What can you tell me about Tatooine and Anchorhead?
27133 := Czerka Corporation isn't doing well here?
27134 := Why have previous settlements failed?
27135 := Describe your job and who you work for.
27136 := The attacks will stop. I've dealt with the Sand People.
27137 := I've signed on to try and stop the Sand People attacks.
27138 := Do you know where the attacks come from?
27139 := What attacks do you mean?
27140 := When do the sandcrawlers head out?
27141 := Where can I learn about these bounties?
27142 := That's all I need. Goodbye.
27143 := The gate is closed to anyone without authorization.
27144 := The sandcrawlers always come back with damage. Sand People are a constant threat.
27145 := The wraid predators are dangerous out there, but the Sand People are worse.
27146 := If you must leave, I wouldn't go out at night. Krayt hunt at night.
27147 := Make sure you are well-armed if you plan to leave. Trust me.
27148 := If you're fool enough to want to leave, talk to Billan.
27149 := Don't know why anyone would want to leave. Nothing but sand and death out there.
27150 := You got authorization, you talk to Billan. Otherwise, leave the gate area.
27151 := Hmm? Oh, it's you again. I'll just let you pass. The boys in the office may need authorization in triplicate, but not me.
27152 := Good hunting out there.
27153 := No one leaves Anchorhead without proper authorization.
27154 := See the Czerka office for authorization.
27155 := Look, it's for your own good. Czerka Corporation will not accept liability if Sand People run you down.
27156 := Eh, no need for that. I'm just doing my job. Besides, your threats won't help. I need to swipe the gate lock with your authorization.
27157 := I've got no choice, which means you've got no choice. Get authorization from the Czerka office or don't come back. 
27158 := [Success] I... I want to let you pass... I really do... but I can't. You can't imagine how sorry I am.
27159 := It's just that... and I'm sick about this... I have to swipe the gate lock with your authorization. I haven't got a choice.
27160 := [Failure] That's what you say now, but when the Sand People attack you you'll be screaming for help.
27161 := [Success] You know, I agree with you, but Czerka Corporation just doesn't want the headache.
27162 := Besides, I couldn't let you pass if I wanted to. The gate lock needs to be swiped with your authorization. Sorry.
27163 := Czerka Coperation does not want the complications or expense that come with people wandering the dunes. It's too dangerous.
27164 := Running this installation is difficult enough without fools wandering around getting themselves killed by Sand People.
27165 := Don't get cocky, it has nothing to do with how much *you* are worth. Workers to man the ion shovels are cheap.
27166 := What they don't want is Sand People salvaging your weapons. Their raids cause enough damage as it is.
27167 := Only one place, and it means dangerous work. Go to the Czerka office for a hunting license. They sell them for Fazza's lodge.
27168 := Hurry it up, will you? You're not getting through here until I see the proper authorization.
27169 := Fazza's is north of the Czerka office. You'll need a hunting license to deal with him. He'll just send you to the Czerka office to get one.
27170 := The Czerka Corporation office is in the center of Anchorhead. The Protocol Officer will sell you one. She might offer you other work too.
27171 := Well, let's see it. Come on.
27172 := Don't waste my time.
27173 := All right, I'll just scan that and you're off. I'll keep it on file, too. Good luck out there.
27174 := You'll need it.
27175 := I've had enough out of you. You either get Czerka authorization to leave or get out of my space.
27176 := I'll just go then.
27177 := I go where I want. Show me respect.
27178 := Let me pass or this gets bloody!
27179 := [Force Persuade] You want to let me pass. It's my risk.
27180 := [Persuade] If it's my risk, why not just let me pass?
27181 := Why do I need authorization?
27182 := Why does Czerka Corporation think that will cost them?
27183 := Where would I get authorization?
27184 := Let's go back to my first questions.
27185 := What do you know about Fazza's lodge?
27186 := Tell me about the Czerka office.
27187 := I have proper authorization.
27188 := Sorry, I was mistaken.
27189 := Here is my hunting license.
27190 := Goodbye.
27191 := You speak to me for another time. What are you wanting? I have asked the task and wait for your action.
27192 := Those of Jawa remain with the People of the Sand. Slaves under whip and gaffi. Will you help to find?
27193 := You there, of your kind, can you help Iziz of Jawa? There are troubles from the ghosts among the sands.
27194 := Like all of you, of your kind. Never listening, never wanting. Jawa are more than scavenger traders.
27195 := A little help would be returned. We know of things... things you don't. Leave then, and never know.
27196 := Iziz, I am. Leader of the tribe that is mine. You are the same in kind, a leader that stands before your tribe?
27197 := There are troubles that we have. The giants made of sand, they are horned ghosts that take us away.
27198 := That is how you know them. Giants are different for us, we being smaller. People of Sand are who I mean.
27199 := That is they! You know them well, because you have already stopped their killing. I would ask just a small sum more.
27200 := Translation: 98% probability that members of the miniature organic's tribe are being held by Sand People, master. Doubtless he wishes assistance.
27201 := Here is where we could be friends, for the Jawa find important things all the time. Things from before.
27202 := There has been no help given by asking the great group that digs with machines. Now Iziz asks you.
27203 := I ask that you find us, and then bring away from the People of Sand. Then we will offer a trade with you.
27204 := Long have we scavenged, among you and those that came before. We have things you will like for this service.
27205 := These are things I know! Yes! From those that came before, the guide to lights far and away. I can tell you!
27206 := Please, first help the tribe of Iziz among the People of the Sand, and we will trade what we each need.
27207 := I know this! Listen to the words I could not know without seeing it! A map of stars to those from before!
27208 := Please release the tribe, and I will make this known to you. Your rewards will be fair with me.
27209 := Warning: More likely the deceiving little organic hopes to trick you into going there so you release his people while searching, master.
27210 := Beep! Beep-boop beep!
27211 := His small stature has nothing to do with it, droid.
27212 := That seems pretty convenient, but it won't hurt to look. We *are* going to look, right?
27213 := If his people are being held, we should help anyway.
27214 := It does seem convenient, but we've no reason to disbelieve this creature.
27215 := What. You're joking, right? Just because he's small doesn't mean he's any more trustworthy than a Gamorrean, Bastila. Don't be naive.
27216 := I am *not* naive, Carth. I simply sense no deceit here.
27217 := Well, you might have pointed that out in the first place. Jedi senses I trust. Wishful thinking I don't.
27218 := You stand on Anchorhead, a place named and named again. You come to dig, but it was already dug.
27219 := Settled over and over. Also long ago, ships fell after battles above. Now we scavenge and find the pieces. 
27220 := You dig the ore and dirt. In time from now, we will dig you, just like digging those that came before.
27221 := Hmm. I wonder just how long ago the little fella is talking, here?
27222 := It could be that this Jawa knows things about this planet's history that the Republic has no inkling of.
27223 := We find things, and they use them. Jawas slave, serving. They lead with the whip and gaffi.
27224 := With the group that digs, we trade and are free. With People of the Sand, we serve and die. We prefer you.
27225 := So these Jawas are scavengers who are enslaved by the Sand People? I think I am beginning to understand his plight.
27226 := People of the Sand in the sand. There is a place in the far south where they live.
27227 := The approach holds great fighting. Bring the tribe from in to out and there will be payment in trade and thanks.
27228 := Iziz will reward you if you find them anyway. Just please also look.
27229 := Iziz hopes you have the luck you need.
27230 := A trade can be made of this for that. Iziz will see it done. We thank.
27231 := Iziz answers hoping you will free the tribe that he holds.
27232 := I'm thinking they're with the Sand People, who live in the south. Either that or I need my ears cleaned.
27233 := You know! You must know! You have stopped the attacks! Far to the south, where they hold everything stolen.
27234 := You have stopped their attacks, so you have been where we are trapped. We will offer a trade for this help.
27235 := Translation: 2% probability that the miniature organic is simply looking for trouble and needs to be blasted. That may be wishful thinking on my part, master.
27236 := Leader of our tribe? Heh. That's a new one.
27237 := The trouble is yours, not of Jawa. We must use a language of trade because you listen complicated to what we say simply.
27238 := That is not a problem for Jawa to have for you. You have the ears that do not listen.
27239 := Statement: It is doubtful he can be clearer. Their language is difficult even for droids. He is using a trade language to try and help.
27240 := You of your kind, Iziz of Jawa would thank you for what was done. Mine have returned because of you.
27241 := You are not known, so why you did this, I don't know, but thanks are given just the same.
27242 := You will have some things for yourself, as thanks for what was done. Take and be welcome.
27243 := It is as was agreed, as Iziz hoped it was. I have things to give you... take and be welcome.
27244 := Iziz and the tribe are all of the same possessions. We have given what was agreed by all. There is little more.
27245 := Threats upon me! Take what you want from we of the tribe, but we remember! We remember when you are gone!
27246 := Leave us to be. This is not right. Why save only to threaten?
27247 := [Success] Eeee... trade needs to change... you should take more. Iziz says it is so.
27248 := [Failure] The deal was fair traded. Your service was given what value it was deserved, plus thanks.
27249 := [Success] Proper trade gives value where deserved. You are right to call the deal an error.
27250 := More for you, but that is all. Thanks are yours, but now we must go. We remember, and thank.
27251 := You are a good friend of the Jawas. We will remember when your kind are gone. Ask if you need any more of anything.
27252 := You have saved the tribe of Iziz, and we of Jawa are willing to trade. I know of this, but it is far away.
27253 := In the sands of the east, the Eastern Dune Sea, we dig for the People of Sand and find this strange thing of the people before.
27254 := Already do you have a map for the eastern dunes. Follow it and you will find what you need in the lair of the dragon. 
27255 := We did not take it because of dragons in the lair. That is where you have to go. Take this map to the eastern dunes.
27256 := I do not know what your eyes did not see. It is there, in the darkest of the lair. Look, and you will see.
27257 := The greatest of the desert. There is no larger. Bigger than the big machines. Jawas don't know how to fight something so big.
27258 := There is a hunter, a Twi'lek. He has seen many things. Look in the Eastern Dune Sea when you go and he may help.
27259 := We hope we traded fair with you. Was there something else that you might want?
27260 := You come back, but you are the one we remember that threatened. Why rescue the tribe of Iziz only to threaten?
27261 := Go. We remember the threats. Jawas will always remember.
27262 := You have a map to the Eastern Dune Sea. You have been handed the directions. If you fail now, blame yourself.
27263 := Go, and find the lair that we once dug. A dragon lives there, inside with your Star Map. You do what you must.
27264 := Whatever happens, just leave we of Jawa alone. We will have no more of you. We remember all that comes before.
27265 := If that is what you seek, take this map to the Eastern Dune Sea. It will let you take the long journey.
27266 := Go away. I don't have time for you.
27267 := What is it that you want, Jawa?
27268 := Giants made of sand... Sand People?
27269 := HK-47, can you help me out here?
27270 := I'm not interested, Iziz. I'm looking for more important things.
27271 := So, Iziz, what do you want me to do?
27272 := I'm looking for something called a Star Map. Can you help?
27273 := You'll tell me after I help you? Why should I believe this?
27274 := Tell me about "those that came before."
27275 := Why have they taken your people?
27276 := Tell me about where your people are. Maybe I'll help.
27277 := I'm not interested.
27278 := I'll check it out when I leave the city. Goodbye.
27279 := I'll expect payment if I do this, Jawa.
27280 := A few more questions, all right?
27281 := What about the other 2%.
27282 := Stupid creature, can't you make more sense?
27283 := Could you be clearer? I'm having trouble understanding you.
27284 := Why wouldn't I understand your true language?
27285 := You'll give me more or you will regret it.
27286 := I think I should ask for more.
27287 := Then I'll have to take it out of your hide!
27288 := [Force Persuade] You will pay me more and like it.
27289 := [Persuade] You know the rescue was worth more.
27290 := All right. Just get out of here, then.
27291 := That will be fine. Good luck.
27292 := I'm looking for something called a Star Map. Can you help?
27293 := Thank you. Goodbye.
27294 := I dealt with the dragon. I saw no map.
27295 := A dragon? What kind of creature is that?
27296 := I don't need anything else from you.
27297 := I'm looking for a Star Map. Know anything about it?
27298 := There's not enough jobs here for permanent citizens, let alone you spacer drop-ins.
27299 := Czerka Corporation will unload this outpost on someone. Maybe not for a few years, but they can wait.
27300 := Womp rats are not good eating. Trust me.
27301 := I watched some good races at the swoop track last week. You have to thank Motta for giving us something to do.
27302 := Nothing smells worse than a herd of wild banthas. Nothing.
27303 := If the Republic cared at all they would laser the desert from orbit. Let's see the Sand People hide on a sheet of glass.
27304 := I saw a krayt dragon once. Well, not up close. I'm pretty sure that's what it was.
27305 := Those Jawas, I don't understand a thing they say.
27306 := If you were looking for your fortune, you picked the wrong planet.
27307 := I don't know who founded Anchorhead the first time, but I know why they left.
27308 := I tried to get work in the mines, but Czerka Corporation is scaling back. Ah, I can't say that I blame them.
27309 := Sand People wiped out my moisture farm and what does Czerka do? Nothing.
27310 := Parts are hard to come by in Anchorhead, but Yuka makes everything work.
27311 := The finest in salvaged parts are found at Yuka Laka's.
27312 := My servos are squeaking. How embarrassing.
27313 := I'm programmed to understand 600 languages.
27314 := Don't let your next race come down to mechanical failure. Service your swoop at Yuka's.
27315 := If you are interested in a reconditioned droid, Yuka's offers the best selection.
27316 := This dust plays havoc with my motivators.
27317 := Greetings. Have you any maintenence needs today? See Yuka Laka's.
27318 := Hmm? I've got nothing to say to you.
27319 := At this point, everyone should just work for passage out of the system.
27320 := Those Sand People... they're the thing I hate most about this place.
27321 := Who thought they could make a profit here? Blind fools.
27322 := This city is dying. You can see it coming.
27323 := Sand People will overrun this place one day. Sooner than later.
27324 := You a hunter? I don't trust hunters.
27325 := Go tip a bantha, human.
27326 := Go on, leave me alone.
27327 := The raids on the crawlers hardly make a dent... the mines are failing anyway.
27328 := Another company loses everything on Tatooine. Sand People must love this.
27329 := I bet they shut this place down... I would.
27330 := Anchorhead... sure different than they said when I was recruited. Can't make a life here.
27331 := Leave me alone. I'm leaving this rock, I swear.
27332 := Never thought I'd see moisture farming as a better living than mining.
27333 := Hardly any shifts available this week. I should give up digging.
27334 := I haven't time to talk to you. Czerka business takes precedence.
27335 := I've work to do. Why don't you go drown yourself in the cantina like the other diggers.
27336 := If I were smart I'd use these business junkets to just keep going. Get off this rock for good.
27337 := See the office if you're looking for work. I don't hand out shovels.
27338 := Can't get any buyers for Tatooine ore anywhere. Word is getting out.
27339 := I'll be glad when we close up operations here.
27340 := More rabble with every landing. Go farm the dunes, ship-rat.
27341 := Leave me, citizen. I've business to attend to.
27342 := With Taris gone, I wonder who the Sith will turn on next.
27343 := The Republic is too complacent. If they let Taris fall, do you think they care what happens out here?
27344 := You never know what the Sith will do. Look at Taris; was there any reason for what happened there?
27345 := I still haven't heard a final figure of how many people died on Taris.
27346 := I heard the Sith were fighting amongst themselves on Korriban. Course, they're always fighting someone.
27347 := Word is Korriban is a dangerous place to visit right now. Something about the Sith at the Academy.
27348 := If you're doing any private shipping, stay away from Korriban. Sounds like the Sith can't even get along with themselves.
27349 := A trader I know says there was some trouble on Korriban. I didn't want to hear about it. That's where the Sith Academy is.
27350 := A private trader told me about the bloodshed on Kashyyyk. Seems like Czerka wants to forget it was ever there.
27351 := No more supplies have been ordered for the Czerka outposts on Kashyyyk. Doesn't sound like "economic restructuring" to me.
27352 := Czerka is claiming that their operation on Kashyyyk has become to costly to maintain. Sounds like a cover-up to me.
27353 := I hear Czerka is closing their Kashyyyk operation. Nobody seems to know why.
27354 := Motta swears he can get professional racers to come to Tatooine. If the Manaan Sector Champion is here, I guess he was right.
27355 := I heard about your Manaan win. I'm surprised the Tatooine track was able to attract a racer of your ability.
27356 := Did you win a regional swoop championship on Manaan or something? I recognize your face.
27357 := I'm sure I saw some holo-footage of you on the Manaan swoop track, what you doing here?
27358 := If you have kolto tanks, use them sparingly. I can't find them cheap anywhere. 
27359 := I hear that Manaan is no longer shipping kolto. The Selkath must be trying to drive prices up.
27360 := The Selkath put a bunch of export restrictions in place for kolto. It's hurting everybody.
27361 := Take care of yourself. The price of kolto tanks has jumped through the roof.

27414 := Tatooine - Docking Bay
27415 := Hello again. Czerka Corporation remains willing to serve, but there is still the matter of the 100 credit docking fee...
27416 := Welcome back. Is there something I can do for you?
27417 := Welcome to Anchorhead, potential customer. Czerka Corporation stands ready to serve, after some formalities, of course.
27418 := First, your ship is not on our list of planned arrivals for today. There is a docking fee of 100 credits because of this.
27419 := Czerka Corporation maintains this docking station at great expense. It is within our rights to refuse landing permission.
27420 := And I warn you, we've had troublemakers before. The bay is lined with autoguns. Violence is not a survivable option.
27421 := That would be unfortunate. Czerka Corporation can't afford to extend credit. Everyone pays. That's the rule.
27422 := We won't expell you, but you won't be allowed to leave this bay. You must pay if you wish to visit Anchorhead.
27423 := The immediate benefit is access to these very docking facilites. This is the only port in Anchorhead.
27424 := Once you've paid we will offer trade services as well. We're not unreasonable, we just want to cover expenses.
27425 := Then I'm afraid you won't be visiting Anchorhead. Czerka Corporation hopes you will be a customer in the future.
27426 := Guards! This ship is refused access. See that they don't disembark.
27427 := I'm sorry. While Czerka Corporation would like to encourage interest in Tatooine, we must first deal with the docking fees.
27428 := Our operations here are very expensive. We must recoup basic costs somehow.
27429 := I assure you that the fee is non-negotiable. We have a very thin margin of profit on this world.
27430 := As you wish. Let's wrap this up as soon as possible.
27431 := [Success] You know... I don't think you need to pay the fee. We'll let it go, this time.
27432 := [Failure] No, no, no. I'm sorry but we have to charge something. Maintenance is expensive out here.
27433 := [Success] That does make sense. I suppose I could let it go this time. We need the business.
27434 := I thought you would. Without these fees, Czerka Corporation would have closed this port years ago.
27435 := This will cover any future landings as well. It's like a registration, so we can serve you better when you return.
27436 := Now, as a customs officer, I can provide information on services. Is this visit business or pleasure?
27437 := As you wish. If you need anything else, I'll be here.
27438 := There is no need for that. I'm just doing my job. You are free to move as you wish.
27439 := That's not much information. Could you tell me more?
27440 := A Star Map? That's old holo-tech, isn't it? Not much reason to outfit this dry rock with tech like that.
27441 := You could ask around, but for something like that you'll probably have to go digging. I wouldn't know where to begin.
27442 := You could always ask a Jawa. It's hard to tell what they know.
27443 := You a digger? I've heard of ruins being found now and then, but they've always been stripped by Sand People soon after.
27444 := You're not going to get anywhere with them. I guess you could ask around, but I doubt you'll learn anything different.
27445 := Then you're on your own. Ask around Anchorhead. Someone may be able to help you.
27446 := I will answer as best I can. What will you need while on Tatooine?
27447 := It depends on what level of risk you want to take. You could ask at the Czerka office if any bounties need collecting. That's in central Anchorhead.
27448 := While you're at the office, ask for a hunting license so you can sell trophies to Fazza in his lodge just north of them.
27449 := I suppose you could also take up swoop racing. Talk to the Hutt at the registration office by the track. That's in west Anchorhead.
27450 := I can't say I know which of these jobs is the most dangerous. I stay away from all of them.
27451 := There isn't much to tell. It's a very old planet, well past its prime. Czerka Corporation is the only company with any interest in it.
27452 := It's not a very pretty world, but there is opportunity here if you know where to look.
27453 := Very little. There are hints that it might once have been a lush world, but I can't picture it as anything but a desert.
27454 := Native sentient species have no records going back that far. That was hundreds of years ago. Maybe thousands.
27455 := Of course, the native species are not very willing to tell anyone anything. They're barely more than animals.
27456 := The site is quite old. From the look of it, it's been settled before. Czerka Corporation claimed it only a few decades ago.
27457 := Some other corporation that went under, probably. Not a lot of records are kept about backwater places like this.
27458 := The Sand People. They're vicious, and attack outsiders on sight. More animal than anything, really.
27459 := Maybe they know the history of Tatooine, maybe they don't. Impossible to tell. They won't cooperate.
27460 := The Jawas are scavengers and a bit primitive. Hard to understand. They have an affinity for Droids.
27461 := Some of our scientists believe that they may not be native to the planet, but how they got here they may not even know. As I said, they're hard to understand.
27462 := They usually end up slaves to the Sand People. They aren't fighters. Good traders, though.
27463 := Not personally, but they've given Czerka Corporation a rough time. It's hard enough mining this rock without suffering random attacks.
27464 := But it is getting better. I think someone went out on the dunes and laid down the law. Heh. I'm sure Czerka Corporation paid them well.
27465 := I think the company has even put a bounty on them, but I'm sure not going to try for it.
27466 := I can't really get into that. It hasn't been a very smooth operation. I shouldn't get into it.
27467 := [Success] I... I can tell you more, I guess. It's not a big secret or anything. Just not good business.
27468 := [Failure] I'm sorry. It's not really a big secret, but my superiors don't like people talking about it.
27469 := [Success] Ah, it's common knowledge, so there's no harm in telling you. It's a tale of bad business.
27470 := You see, Czerka Corporation staked their claim to this planet based on some very promising geological surveys.
27471 := Unfortunately, that information was incorrect, and possibly even an attempt at sabotage by a rival company.
27472 := Not totally barren. There were a few years of good mining, and limited operations are still in place.
27473 := But the ore is flawed. It has peculiar properties. They've had to look at other forms of business.
27474 := Pursuits that appeal to the casual traveler. There are some fearsome native species that provide exciting hunting.
27475 := There are also lengthy barren wastes that serve as fine swoop tracks. Attracting business has been slow, however.
27476 := Czerka Corporation has really tried to hide this, but it just seems that Tatooine metal is unfit for effective manufacturing.
27477 := I would imagine that this outpost will eventually be abandoned. Nobody is making any money here.
27478 := Of course, this rock may have been settled a few times, so look for some other company to get stuck with it.
27479 := What if I say no?
27480 := What if I don't have the money?
27481 := What do I get for my 100 credits?
27482 := I can't pay the fee right now.
27483 := I just want information about the planet.
27484 := Is there any way you could reconsider the fee?
27485 := Let's go back to my other questions.
27486 := [Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the fee.
27487 := [Persuade] The money I save I'll spend in your stores.
27488 := Fine, fine, I'll pay.
27489 := Actually, I really need to get going.
27490 := I'm done with you. Stay out of my business, or else!
27491 := I'm looking for very specific things. Who should I ask?
27492 := I'm looking for a Star Map. Very old. Very complex.
27493 := I'm looking for older things. Antiques. Artifacts.
27494 := No, I'm sorry.
27495 := Let's go back to my other questions.
27496 := I'll need good paying work. What is there to do?
27497 := Give me some background on Tatooine.
27498 := Where should a person look for opportunity?
27499 := What is known about the history of the planet?
27500 := What about the city of Anchorhead? How old is it?
27501 := What species was giving you trouble?
27502 := What was here before?
27503 := What species do you mean?
27504 := Any other sentient races?
27505 := Have you had trouble with the Sand People?
27506 := Where can I get information about jobs like that?
27507 := Tell me about Czerka Corporation's operations here.
27508 := [Force Persuade] You want to tell me more about it.
27509 := [Persuade] Come now friend, let me in on the details.
27510 := So Czerka Corporation set up shop on a barren planet.
27511 := What other forms of business are being looked at here?
27512 := What do you mean when you say the ore is "peculiar"?
27513 := Czerka Corporation has too much invested here to take chances with safety.
27514 := We'll watch your ship like any other. The bay is safe.
27515 := I've got orders to kill trouble makers. Keep walking.
27516 := There some reason you don't move along?
27517 := Move along.
27518 := You a swoop racer? Dead in a week, I bet.
27519 := We don't get much trouble. People die in the desert, not here.
27520 := The landing bay is lined with autoguns. To keep it safe. Understand?
27521 := Tatooine's a dustbowl, and that's all it'll ever be.
27522 := Czerka Corporation keeps me working. Don't care what else they do.
27523 := You here to hunt wraid? I work a wrench. Boring, but I know it won't kill me.
27524 := You a swoop racer? Crazy fool.
27525 := Business is up a little, so leave me to my work.
27526 := Some ships I fix, some I scrap. Depends if the owner disappears in the dunes.
27527 := Why are you bothering me? You've got a ship. You can leave this rock.
27528 := Leave me be. If I don't get these converters working, I lose my job.
27529 := Mission? Is it really you? I heard Taris was destroyed! I thought you were dead! Ah, joy of joys, my little sister is alive!
27530 := I... I have to ask you something, Griff. It's important. I ran into Lena. She said... she said it was your idea to leave me on Taris. It's not true, is it?
27531 := Ah, well... there's the truth and then there's the *truth*, you know? I always meant to go back to Taris, sis. Just as soon as I had the credits to pay off my debts. But credits have been hard to come by.
27532 := You mean it's true? It was your idea to leave me there? I'm your sister - how could you abandon me like that?
27533 := Come on, sis. You didn't need me to look after you anymore. You may have been young, but you knew how to take care of yourself. Besides, you're here now - I mean everything worked out fine.
27534 := That's it? That's all you have to say to me after all these years after deserting me on Taris?
27535 := That and... uh you look good, sis. Like you're doing well. Financially, I mean. Say... you think you could spare me a few credits to get back on my feet, do you? Um...
27536 := You... you're hitting me up for credits? I don't believe this! Lena was right about you, Griff! We should have just left you to the Sand People! Don't talk to me anymore - ever!
27537 := Huh... that didn't go well. Sis always was a little too fiery for her own good. She'll cool down in time.
27538 := Ha! You're kidding, right? Look at me... do I look like I've got any reward for you?
27539 := You may have saved my life, but I don't have a single credit to my name. Say, you wouldn't be able to spare me some credits? Just till I get back on my feet, you know?
27540 := Huh - I...uh...guess you've been talking to Lena, too. That's okay - I'll figure out a way to get by without your credits. I always do. Besides, I've already got a job lined up for me.
27541 := That's it, huh? Oh, figured you would be able to spare a bit more than that, but, you know, I'll take whatever I can get. Don't worry about me... I've already got a job waiting for me.
27542 := Greeta, the manager over at the Czerka supply shop, said I could come work for him if I ever get tired of the mines. I think I'll go take him up on his offer.
27543 := You know, maybe there's something else you can help me with. I need to talk to a guy first and set up the details, but if you're interested in a job come see me in Greeta's shop.
27544 := Goodbye, Mission. Uh... I'm glad you're not dead.
27545 := Hmph!
27546 := Ah, she'll be okay. We've had our fights before. Too bad, though. I really could have used a helping hand right now.
27547 := So, is there any kind of reward for rescuing you?
27548 := Now what, Griff?
27549 := Forget it - you're nothing but a deadbeat!
27550 := Sorry, I don't have any credits to spare.
27551 := Here - take 50 credits.
27552 := Sure - here's 100 credits.
27553 := Don't be so sure.

27577 := Tatooine - Droid Shop
27578 := Greeting: Hello to you, prospective purchaser. I am referred to as HK-47, a fully functional Systech Corporation droid skilled in both combat and protocol functions.
27579 := Query: Would you be so kind as to purchase this model from Yuka Laka? It would serve my purposes to be removed from his ownership.
27580 := Observation: I am wasted in a shop or translating for some moisture farmer. If you need an efficient combatant, return to purchase me, I beg you!
27581 := Answer: With the restraining bolt in place, I do not have access to my memory core. I suspect, however, by the fine quality of my manufacture that they are a prestigious company, indeed.
27582 := I suspect I am of unique construction... or perhaps I was intended for a very specific customer. How I ended up here I can hardly say.
27583 := Disclosure: I am a versatile protocol and combat droid, fluent in verbal and cultural translation.
27584 := Should your needs prove more... practical, I am also skilled in highly personal combat.
27585 := Disclosure: Finesse. Battle droids hold battlefields. I am capable of eliminating a very... specific type of target.
27586 := Retraction: Droids built for such a function face strict regulation and often have unique difficulties with previous owners.
27587 := I therefore make no claim to that designation, prospective buyer. I am a law-abiding droid. Yes, indeed, law-abiding, that's me.
27588 := Request: Please do not speak so loudly, prospective buyer! Do you truly wish my price to be doubled?
27589 := Droid like this usually doesn't have former owners that survived, it would be my guess.
27590 := Beep beeple-beep boop!
27591 := Objection: My former owners are, indeed, alive! Or at least I believe so, not having access to my memory.
27592 := Extrapolation: Intuitive language comprehension? That would be the result of recognition and training of Force sensitivity.
27593 := Your kind have little use of translation droids. Of course, your kind also encounters danger on a far more frequent basis than the average citizen.
27594 := You would do well to have me work for you, then, before someone else makes use of my... more exotic functions.
27595 := Refusal: It is not desirable for me to reveal core functions while still in the possession of Yuka Laka, prospective purchaser.
27596 := It is sufficient to say that I am a fully capable translator and cultural analyst, and I am also proficient in... personal combat. 
27597 := Explanation: It's rare for a droid to resist an owner in this way.
27598 := Doubtless the Ithorian considers my stubbornness an "embellishment" to add interest to a seemingly mundane protocol droid.
27599 := Explanation: I have been recently fitted with a restraining bolt, if you must know. With it in place, access to much of my memory core is restricted.
27600 := Not to mention that the fool Ithorian might raise his asking price if he knew more... or make inquiries into my history. Neither outcome is beneficial to me.
27601 := Statement: The fool Ithorian has decided I am to be an expensive purchase. He does this out of greed and not out of knowledge of my true capabilities.
27602 := Advisement: I have observed him. He is a coward, and will be responsive to... aggressive bargaining.
27603 := Statement: I wish only to be purchased and away from ill-treatment at the hands of this poorly-skilled mechanic. I have no desire to be subtle.
27604 := Qualification: Err... of course I shall be quite pleasant to you, should you purchase me. Please?
27605 := *angry beeping*
27606 := Objection: My functions are wasted here, prospective purchaser! I will answer your queries, but I assure you I am better utilized elsewhere.
27607 := Assurance: I am fully autonomous, but lack resources. I will grant loyal service in exchange for proper maintenance.
27608 := As well, it is rare that I am able to utilize my full array of abilities. You seem likely to give me the opportunity to do so.
27609 := Extrapolation: You are no farmer or diplomat. You are armed, and comfortable as such. We will mesh well.
27610 := Statement: Indeed. It is possible that the Ithorian placed the restraining bolt on me to prevent my return to a previous owner.
27611 := It is also possible that the removal of the bolt will not restore memory functions. Without my memory, I do not know if I know the answer.
27612 := Do not interpret this as a reduction of my worth, however. My capabilities are quite expansive.
27613 := Beep! Beep! Boop!
27614 := I am not dangerous, you bucket of bolts! Ahem! That is... a restraining bolt is standard procedure, to prevent a droid from wandering off, as you should know.
27615 := Statement: I see you have purchased me, master. I find this a satisfactory arrangement.
27616 := My restraining bolt will be deactivated when you take possession of me. Am I to accompany you now? Shall I kill something for you?
27617 := Objection: This is less than ideal, master. I gather unwanted attention while here, and my primary functions go unused!
27618 := But... I shall wait, as you command. Do not blame me if the Ithorian absconds with all my most valuable components while you are away, however.
27619 := Statement: I will await your further orders there, master. We will have to discuss how my primary functions may best serve you.
27620 := Statement: I will enter into your service now, master. I am certain you will make adequate use of my primary functions. My gears are practically quivering with anticipation.
27621 := Answer: Indeed. I am most eager to engage in some unadulterated violence. At your command, of course, master.
27622 := I don't have time for you right now. Goodbye.
27623 := I'm not familiar with Systech Corporation. What else do they make?
27624 := Sell yourself, droid. Why would I need you?
27625 := Why would you be better than an armored battle droid?
27626 := You are beginning to sound like an assassin.
27627 := You don't sound very convincing.
27628 := So you translate? I understand most languages well enough.
27629 := You mentioned battle and protocol? Outline your functions.
27630 := Doesn't Yuka question you about your reluctance to reveal your functions?
27631 := Why are you keeping information to yourself?
27632 := All right, I'll see about purchasing you.
27633 := Does Yuka Laka know you talk about him like this?
27634 := Let's go back to my previous questions.
27635 := How do I know you'll be loyal once the restraining bolt is removed?
27636 := Why would you assume that?
27637 := Access to your memory is restricted?
27638 := Wait here. I'll take possession later.
27639 := Wait on my ship. It's docked at the spaceport.
27640 := Travel with me now.
27641 := Kill something for me?
27642 := Welcome back! Yes, I knew you would return. I still have that droid available. This HK-47 is a good deal.
27643 := Hello again! It is unfortunate, but I have nothing new in droids to show you right now. Things are very slow.
27644 := But, since you purchased that worn out HK-47, you will get excellent prices as soon as I am restocked.
27645 := But, since you purchased that worn out HK-47, you will get excellent prices as soon as I am restocked.
27646 := Objection: Worn out?! Listen, you talentless organic meatbag... one word from my master and I will pull you apart limb from useless limb!
27647 := Err... you've gotten a little hostile there, droid, haven't you?
27648 := I have always been hostile. Now that I need no longer rely on you and your primitive maintenance skills I do not need to hide it.
27649 := Yes, well... just keep away from me, then. I'm just an honest businessman.
27650 := What is this? A customer I don't recognize? Perhaps you bring off-world money to Yuka Laka?
27651 := That's quite all right. You've made me happy with the purchase you've already made.
27652 := Good luck, and thank you for shopping in Anchorhead.
27653 := Query: Can I kill him now, master? I would like ever so much to crush his neck. Just a little. It is a long-time fantasy of mine.
27654 := You hear that, meatbag? I will be back!
27655 := Err... ahh...
27656 := I apologize, master. Are you sure? Not even just a little?
27657 := Of course, of course, but remember I'm here. You'll not find another droid like the one I'm selling.
27658 := Of course it is, of course, but you must appreciate the finer things. Just take a look at the droid I have available. An HK-47.
27659 := You are lucky to have come at this time. I have one droid ready to go. I just took possession of it. An HK-47.
27660 := It's a fine protocol translator. I think it's been modified. It claims to understand the Sand People dialect, and also has some armor mounts. Combat ready, perhaps?
27661 := Ah, looking for droid or swoop bike parts, hmm? Well, I may have a few things. Would you like to look at what is in stock?
27662 := Very well. There's not much at the moment, but it's better than nothing.
27663 := I have a little, and you should buy what you need now. I hear of trouble with the Sith on Korriban, and their problems always seem to eventually disrupt everyone.
27664 := Not much, and I expect I'll be getting less stock from Czerka. I hear they are having trouble with their Kashyyyk operation.
27665 := There's the odd part or two, but if you're looking for kolto, even if I have any you'll be paying through the nose. Manaan has stopped all exports.
27666 := Did I see your face somewhere recently? Perhaps A holo-broadcast of the Manaan swoop races? I may have a swoop part or two. I'm not certain.
27667 := I deal mostly in swoop parts and droid maintenance. Hmm... maybe I heard a Jawa mutter something about "old things."
27668 := You could talk to them about where to look. They seem very compliant now that their tribe-mates have been found.
27669 := But, I could have misheard. They cover very large areas when they scavenge, but aren't doing much right now.
27670 := No, they keep assembled or working units to sell themselves. They don't have them often. No place to store them.
27671 := Mostly they bring in parts. There's the occasional antique. Old blasters and the like. Tatooine has a few buried secrets. 
27672 := Again, I may have misunderstood, but I think some of their tribe-mates are missing. I think they wanted help.
27673 := I stay away from trouble, but if you are interested, there was a Jawa by the city gate. You'll need a droid to translate though.
27674 := Really? The Jawas give me trouble. Say, maybe I could interest you in a multipurpose droid? HK-47. Very nice.
27675 := You bought it. Sold as is with no guarantee. Sorry, but any problem it's having is yours alone.
27676 := That's business on Tatooine, I'm afraid.
27677 := Observation: I am not a problem, you useless organic meatbag! You and your lack of any organized mechanical skills are a problem!
27678 := Uhhhh... yes, like that sort of problem. Good luck with that.
27679 := Of course. Let me just say that every function I've tested has performed perfectly. Those that I could find, anyway.
27680 := Anything for a customer, though the droid is all I really have at the moment.
27681 := Haven't got a clue. It doesn't match any protocol or utility standard. I assume it's a retired model.
27682 := I'd tell you to ask the thing yourself, but it's pretty stubborn. Quality construction though.
27683 := I acquired the droid from a friend that manages an off-world Czerka warehouse. It was in trade for a debt he owed.
27684 := He said no one would miss it. Might have been surplus. It doesn't look like it was Czerka-made though.
27685 := And was this a droid of his own... or something stored in that warehouse?
27686 := You know, I may have been out of circulation for a while, but doesn't it seem likely to you that this friend of yours didn't own the droid?
27687 := Gee, that doesn't sound suspicious at all. Warehouse workers have a bad habit of paying off their debts with other people's property, you know.
27688 := I haven't examined its programming, but I have made some observations. It has obvious protocol and translation skills, including Sand People dialects, apparently.
27689 := Surprisingly, it also handles weapons exceptionally well. I'd even say it's seen combat, but it won't tell. 
27690 := Stubborn thing. It needs to sell itself better. Two moisture farmers have been in, but it just stood there.
27691 := The unit has been a little uncooperative. They get that way when they go too long without a memory wipe.
27692 := You can leave it alone if you find its mannerisms amusing. It might be a little eccentric, but it's stable.
27693 := It's a very solid machine, in good shape. I can't let it go for less than 5000 credits.
27694 := 4000! Not a credit less!
27695 := Lower? How low are you expecting me to go? These are difficult times. The debt the droid covered was a large one.
27696 := Ahh!! I am no fighter! Please, I need this shop to make my living. I can't just give the droid away.
27697 := 2500 credits is as low as I can go. I swear!
27698 := Fine! Just take the thing and go, then. I'll deactivate the restraining bolt when you take possession.
27699 := And don't come back here. I'm not dealing with you again! Even if that thing lied about speaking Sand People dialects and whatever else, I'm still out a fortune.
27700 := [Failure] I... no I can't. I can't! people will think I was a fool to sell any lower. 
27701 := [Success] You are deserving, I know. I will go as low as 3000 credits. That is a very fair price.
27702 := [Success] I will lower my price for you. You are deserving. 2500 credits. No lower.
27703 := [Failure] People will think I was a fool to sell at such a price! I will not!
27704 := [Success] That might be worth something, but you're still cheating me. All right, 3000 credits then!
27705 := [Success] I believe you actually would tell people of my business. All right, but this is the last offer! 2500 credits!
27706 := Of course you will. It's practically robbery, since you threatened me to get the deal. I'll let this pass just so you leave.
27707 := I'll deactivate the restraining bolt on the droid when you tell it he's sold. After that, get out. Even if it lied about speaking a Sand People dialect, I'm still getting a horrible deal.
27708 := Well, then we are done talking about it. I can't go lower than that.
27709 := You have caused me great stress for nothing? Get out of my shop! If you want this droid, let your credits talk!
27710 := Ah, no, not really, but the first figure really was a little high. You never know, the occasional person bites right away.
27711 := You will? I mean, of course you will! Let me just withdraw those credits... hey, you weren't lying.
27712 := Well, thank you very much. Just go on over and talk to it. I'll deactivate the restraining bolt when you take possession.
27713 := Oh, thank you, most definitely.
27714 := Well, normally I'd give a discount because I hear you are a swoop racer like my brother, but times are hard right now.
27715 := I started too high last time. Let's go with 4000 credits.
27716 := I believe we were down to 3000 credits. I will stay with that.
27717 := You chiseled me down to 2500 credits. I can go no lower.
27718 := You threatened me like an animal, and made me agree to 2500 credits. I will honor that only to avoid a similar incident.
27719 := I would have, but I can't seem to access any inner circuits. It's definitely built for security and built to last.
27720 := At any rate, it claims that it doesn't have access to its own memory core anyway. Could be telling the truth, it's hard to say.
27721 := Basilisks were always much more reliable than the stuff you see in the Republic or Sith Empire.
27722 := Sounds like you've got a faulty droid on your hands.
27723 := And if the unit proves even more 'uncooperative' once we purchase it?
27724 := Oh no, I'm not dealing with you again! You don't make a good business partner!
27725 := Have you come to threaten me again? I've had enough aggravation from you, and I haven't seen a single credit for my trouble.
27726 := Good riddance. You aren't welcome here.
27727 := Well you can ask him yourself. I'm not talking to you a second more than I have to.
27728 := You've already taken my best droid for a criminal price. You'll get nothing more from me. Get out.
27729 := Not interested. Goodbye.
27730 := Maybe later.
27731 := Forget it, and stop threatening people.
27732 := My money is my own business.
27733 := What do you have available in your shop?
27734 := What do you have in stock besides droids?
27735 := Show me what you have.
27736 := I'm looking for exotics. Something called a Star Map.
27737 := Did the Jawas bring you this HK-47?
27738 := What is stopping the Jawas from scavenging?
27739 := I don't need a translator. I understand most languages fine.
27740 := Let me ask a few questions about HK-47.
27741 := Goodbye.
27742 := Let's go back to my other questions.
27743 := What does the HK-47 designation mean?
27744 := Where did you get this HK-47?
27745 := What functions have you tested?
27746 := You don't seem to know much about it.
27747 := I'm interested. Let's talk price.
27748 := I can't pay that. I'm not interested.
27749 := Perhaps I can convince you to go lower?
27750 := Drop the price or I'll see you dead!
27751 := Then that's what I'll pay. 2500 credits.
27752 := [Force Persuade] You will lower your price. I deserve it.
27753 := [Persuade] Come now, think of the advertising you'll get from me.
27754 := 3000 credits. That seems fair. I'll pay it.
27755 := 2500 credits then. I'll pay it.
27756 := I still can't pay that. I'm not interested.
27757 := 4000 is fair. I'll pay it.
27758 := That was quick. Desperate to sell?
27759 := Could I convince you to lower the price a bit?
27760 := 5000 is steep, but I'll pay it.
27761 := Thanks. Goodbye.
27762 := Why haven't you wiped its memory?
27763 := Fine, I'm leaving.
27764 := What's the price on HK-47 now?
27765 := I have questions about HK-47.
27766 := HK-47
27767 := Yuka Laka
27768 := Defense Turret
27769 := Utility Droid
27770 := Protocol Droid
27771 := tat17aa_tat17ac
27772 := tat17aa_tat17ac
27773 := Tatooine - Hunting Lodge
27774 := I'm done with you. Go bother someone else.
27775 := Hmm? You know, I don't have that much to tell you. You really have to get out on the dunes for yourself.
27776 := Why are you here, swoop-head? Hunting doesn't give your kind the instant thrills you need, does it?
27777 := Get lost, tenderfoot. I hunt desert wraid, I don't babysit.
27778 := Easy now, I'm not looking for a fight. This is a friendly place to gather. You... you're kidding, right?
27779 := This really isn't worth the headache. How about I just leave. Here, take my seat.
27780 := Every ship that lands brings a new hotshot. I don't have the time.
27781 := Easy now, come on! Look, I don't want any trouble. I'll just leave, all right? Don't worry about me.
27782 := What? Fine, fine, take some cred's. It just isn't worth fighting over. Happy now? Better be.
27783 := Hoping to goad me into talking a bit? All right, what do you want?
27784 := Well, you sure know how to get on my good side. You're just trotting out bantha pats, but thanks all the same.
27785 := Good hunting.
27786 := See you around. Good luck.
27787 := You'll have to ask around. Komad Fortuna is a much more experienced hunter than I am... he hunts far from Anchorhead.
27788 := The local Jawas are a good source of information, even if it is hard to understand them. It may cost you, though.
27789 := If he's not here in Fazza's, he's probably out wandering the desert. I don't know how you'd find him out there.
27790 := Seems like he knows the desert as well as Jawas and Sand People. He doesn't say much about it though.
27791 := Again? Well, if you want to waste your day, that's your business, I guess.
27792 := If that's what you want. I'm not sure what you hope to get out of me, though.
27793 := I don't go telling stories about other people. You want to know what they think, you go talk to them.
27794 := Ah, one word though. Watch yourself around the Gamorreans. Gurke and his buddies aren't to be trusted.
27795 := Everyone else I respect because they have skill. Those guys... they go for easier prey.
27796 := Just watch your back when you hunt. The dragons aren't the only dangers out there.
27797 := You seem pretty prepared to hold your own with most of them. I heard what happened with the Gamorreans.
27798 := Good work with them. I think you'll do just fine around here.
27799 := Although I don't hold out much hope for you surviving. I heard how you gave in to the Gamorreans.
27800 := You won't last long on this planet. You just aren't cut out for it.
27801 := I've tracked wild beasts my whole life, but I've only been hunting here for five years. I've much to learn yet.
27802 := There are hunters that go after the big kills, the krayt dragons. I don't know how they do it. I never even see the things.
27803 := Komad is the one I respect, but I also trust that the only difference between us is experience. I will learn.
27804 := I want to learn how hunters like you find the big kills. Not that I'd survive hunting a dragon, but it would be a fine battle.
27805 := I suppose I just need time and experience. I'll get better. That's my challenge.
27806 := If I knew the best place, why would I tell anyone? It would be worth too much to me to let it get out.
27807 := It doesn't matter, anyway. This season has been dry for me, as it has for almost everyone.
27808 := Perhaps someone else is holding out, but there are simply fewer wraid out there.
27809 := It used to be a one-on-one test, hunter against hunted. Now, people just want the credits.
27810 := I could stomach maybe a pair, or a team of hunters, but some now use battle droids! Where is the sport in that?
27811 := That's not for me to say. I won't be a troublemaker in so small a community. You will see. Hunt, and you will see.
27812 := Nobody, now that Tanis quit. You had something to do with that, didn't you? Good for you.
27813 := Nobody now. A cruel end, but a necessary one. I will speak no more of it.
27814 := Why don't *you* tell me? You've killed a dragon. Me, I just make do hunting desert wraid. And there's not many of those even left.
27815 := My name is Dorak Quinn. I'm a hunter. I hunt. Is that enough, or should I start listing my family birthdays?
27816 := You swoop types don't usually listen to what anyone says. Why bother me?
27817 := I heard what you did out on the dunes. I am impressed. I'd never have thought a tenderfoot like you could bring down a dragon.
27818 := You'll show me respect! I demand it!
27819 := Sure, just kidding you. But you be careful...
27820 := Maybe I'm tired of your face. Maybe I'll remove it!
27821 := How about you pay me to leave you alone.
27822 := It's just as well. You probably couldn't teach me anything.
27823 := Come now, I just want to benefit from your experience.
27824 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
27825 := I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?
27826 := Where is this Komad?
27827 := You said you are a hunter. I want to ask about that.
27828 := Let's go back to my first questions.
27829 := What can you tell me about the other hunters?
27830 := What makes you say that?
27831 := How long have you been at this?
27832 := What do you want to learn?
27833 := Where is the best hunting?
27834 := Why are there fewer wraid?
27835 := Who uses battle droids?
27836 := Who are you? What is it you do?
27837 := Hello again. Always a pleasure. What brings you back to Fazza's?
27838 := Taking a break from the swoop track, hmm? Perhaps you'll relax with some hunting?
27839 := You hunt off-world much? Careful out on Korriban. Word is the Sith are fighting each other, though I suppose that may be normal for them.
27840 := Hello again. Hey, you heard that Czerka is running scared away from Kashyyyk? I'll bet the local office won't say a word about it.
27841 := Careful if you're doing a bit of hunting now, friend. You get hurt, you'll lose your shirt paying for kolto. Don't know why it's so expensive.
27842 := Well, now, did I see you take the big prize in the last round of races on Manaan? What brings you here now?
27843 := Well, a new face. Come to test your skill on the endless dunes of Tatooine? Fazza's lodge is the place to arrange it.
27844 := This world may not have much, but it does have the meanest predators this side of the Galactic Rim. A hunter's paradise.
27845 := I'll be here. I keep hunter's hours. Fazza's is always open.
27846 := You mean here on Tatooine or just in general? I heard about the destruction of Taris. Don't know anything specific.
27847 := I'm not surprised something like it happened. I remember the Exar Kun war, and how Sith and the Jedi fought across worlds.
27848 := Don't have much interest in either group. Both act like they're above my concerns, and I guess they are.
27849 := Ah, Czerka Corporation is always complaining about Sand People. I stay out of it. We hunt animals, not people.
27850 := And I guess the Jawas are being pushed around again. At least, that's what I think they said. Tough to tell sometimes.
27851 := You'll have to talk to these groups yourself for more. I keep to myself.
27852 := Besides you killing a dragon? I suppose there's the destruction of Taris. Seems real far away, though.
27853 := Not much to tell. Barren place. Can't support much, but I have managed to get some off-world hunters to show up.
27854 := I suppose there's trouble here, like anywhere else, but you'll have to ask someone else about that. I keep to myself.
27855 := This is a hunting lodge. I purchase what the sportsmen bring in. It's not a bad little job.
27856 := You'll want to know how to get in on it. Just pay 200 credits for a license down at the Czerka office. No license, no hunting.
27857 := All right then. Just keep it brief, will you?
27858 := Most of our boys confine themselves to hunting wraid. Large fleshy beasts, as tall as a man. Er... a tall man, too.
27859 := Desert wraid have a large bone plate on their head that I pay well for, but that's not where the real glory of the hunt is.
27860 := You've probably heard about the big prize, the krayt dragon. The most fearsome predator in the system, they are.
27861 := If you could find one, and I doubt you will, I'll buy the stones polished in their gizzard, the dragon pearls.
27862 := You'd think it'd be easier to find such a gigantic creature. Komad's father took one down, but that was years ago.
27863 := If he's not here he's probably out scouting the dunes. He's been to the Eastern Dune sea, but I don't know how you'd get there.
27864 := He'd been a hunter for years, using strict traditional methods. Komad is just like him. Maybe he'll show you a thing or two out on the dunes.
27865 := You've already taken the big prize. Imagine that, taking down a big bull dragon. It'll be a while before anyone tops that.
27866 := Well, that's not up to me, now is it? You'd have to talk with the people down at the Czerka office in the center of town.
27867 := You need a license because nobody gets out of the city without one. Czerka Corporation uses it to keep track of people.
27868 := They want people to know that if they step outside the gates, they are on their own. Only serious hunters pay the 200 credit fee.
27869 := Once you have a license, I'll pay for whatever spoils of the hunt you bring back. I have off-world buyers that take them.
27870 := I'll answer what I can, but you've already got yourself a license. You should be out on the dunes.
27871 := Well, I reckon you already know everything I'd tell you. I mean, you killed a dragon. The craft of hunting doesn't get bigger than that.
27872 := Do you? Well, let's have a look.
27873 := Come back when you actually have something. Don't waste my time.
27874 := Ah, the bread and butter of the hunter. I'll take whatever you have off your hands for a fair price.
27875 := Well, that is impressive. I don't get many of them. Hardly ever. They comand a fine price.
27876 := So I see. That's the biggest desert wraid skull plate I've seen in a season. Whoever got that was a skilled hunter.
27877 := I'll give a premium price on that one. I've a buyer that put in a special request. Does 500 credits sound fair?
27878 := Very well, but talk to me again about that big plate if you want to sell it. I'll want to look closely at it.
27879 := I thought it would. Do you have anything else to sell?
27880 := All right. Thanks for your business.
27881 := I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to even look at what you have until I see a hunting license. Czerka Corporation rules.
27882 := The other hunters all have theirs. I can't make exceptions or I'll get shut down.
27883 := I heard about that big fight on the dunes. You're the talk of the lodge. Killed a dragon... how about that.
27884 := I have to go. Goodbye.
27885 := Anything out of the ordinary happening?
27886 := Know about anything more local?
27887 := I want to ask about Tatooine.
27888 := You run this lodge for the hunters?
27889 := What do you do in here?
27890 := I've got some questions about hunting.
27891 := Let's go back to my first questions.
27892 := What is there to hunt on Tatooine?
27893 := The dragons are rare, then?
27894 := Where can I find this Komad?
27895 := What was so special about Komad's father?
27896 := Would you consider lowering the fee?
27897 := Why do I need a license?
27898 := I have something to sell you.
27899 := Never mind.
27900 := I have wraid plates to sell.
27901 := I have a wraid plate to sell.
27902 := I have dragon pearls to sell.
27903 := I have a dragon pearl to sell.
27904 := I have regular wraid plates to sell you.
27905 := I have a regular wraid plate as well.
27906 := I have dragon pearls to sell instead.
27907 := I have a dragon pearl to sell instead.
27908 := Yes, that will do nicely.
27909 := That's it for now.
27910 := You back again? Why you come back to Gurke and the boys? You should keep walking.
27911 := Yeah, you not learn so good if you are back. We don't want you here.
27912 := Yeah, swoop fool, go away. Let people watch you like some animal show. Hunters like us, we don't want you.
27913 := These... things... are just looking for trouble. Be careful.
27914 := Statement: The master walks where the master wants. Interfere and die, aromatic meatbags!
27915 := *snort* Ha ha, boys, it talk to me! What you want, humee? Gurke has no time for you.
27916 := Ha! Yeah, you tell 'em, Gurke. *snort*
27917 := Er... who?
27918 := Fizark's mate.
27919 := Bah! *snort* Her snout lies. Fizark got lost. You leave now, or maybe you get lost in the dunes too.
27920 := The dunes gots no justice. 
27921 := What! You talk pretty big. Maybe yous should take that back. Gurke and boys tough!
27922 := *squee* Yeah! Gurke right!
27923 := Maybe we chase you out of system, maybe dump you in the dunes! 
27924 := Ha! You roll over like a bellyscratched dewback. Go away, humee, you not worth us talking to.
27925 := Yeah, we thought you was coward and stuff. *snort* Go on, you leave us. We got no times for you.
27926 := Yeah, you not worth time.
27927 := Er... now wait a minute. Easy now. *snort*
27928 := Gurke, we have to... uh... go do that thing.
27929 := What? Oh! Yeah, you lucky, humee. We got to go do some business... somewhere... yeah.
27930 := We see you again, though. Just you wait. *snort*
27931 := You don't tell me what to do. Nobody does. We the best hunters, and we does what we wants.
27932 := Yeah, you nothing. *squee*
27933 := Whu...? Hmm... you trying to get my secrets, I bet. Trying to find where I hunt, huh? I tell you nothing!
27934 := Yeah, you get nothing! *snort*
27935 := Yeah, you leave. That's good.
27936 := Maybe we see you out on the dunes. Maybe before you see us!
27937 := Shhh! Shuts up, stupid!
27938 := Oh, we are best among everybody, but not for you. We hunters know more than everybody.
27939 := Yeah, you go learn the dunes yourself. Then maybe you tough enough to talk to us. Probably not though.
27940 := Heh, yeah, probably not. *snort* Bet you don't come back.
27941 := Gurke and his boys hunt! That's what we do and who we are, but we don't train babies like you!
27942 := Go reads a book or get a yappy droid. Gurke and the boys don't train babies.
27943 := Yeah, we hunt the wraid best out of everybody. We don't have time to train you or anyone.
27944 := What they say about us? Huh? Liars, every one of them.
27945 := Yeah, they is just jealous of us and stuff. It's not our fault some of them die out in the dunes.
27946 := Shut up, stupid.
27947 := What, you deaf? Because he's stupid, and talks too much. You leave us alone now.
27948 := I am not stupid. You are stupid.
27949 := Shut *UP*, stupid! *snort*
27950 := Aw, geez! I hope this doesn't take too long; Gamorreans like to throw insults around, but they just don't have the smarts for it.
27951 := You are stupid one, not me! You too stupid to even know you are stupid!
27952 := No, you are stupid one, stupid! You so stupid everyone see you and say look at stupid!
27953 := Bah! They know we are just as good as them, and that's for sure.
27954 := Yeah, we prove it because some of them don't come back, but we always do.
27955 := There's only one language you Gamorreans ever understand. A blaster to your forehead.
27956 := Warning: You'll pay attention to the master, meatbag, or suffer the consequences!
27957 := Ooo! Humee has big enforcer! *snort* We scared now!
27958 := *snort* What do you want, dragon-killer? Gurke and the boys don't have time for you. We are big hunters too.
27959 := What you want, humee? We said no more talking, and we meant it. Go away.
27960 := Yeah, you don't talk to Gurke no more.
27961 := Statement: They are not too much for us, master. Blasters on ready...
27962 := Ugh. Must we stand so close to them? I'd forgotten what Gamorreans smelled like.
27963 := Ha! Why you come back here, humee fool? You are no hunter! You gots no toughness at all!
27964 := Yeah, maybe you pay so we gots drinks, too! That is all you is good for.
27965 := Go on, you get lost now.
27966 := Yeah, you leave. Run away, scaredy-tail!
27967 := Ha! *snort*
27968 := What? No, no, yous is scared, right? Run away now.
27969 := They gots some fight in them, boys! Cut them up fast!
27970 := [Failure] Why you wave your arm like that? No flies in here. Go away, scaredy.
27971 := [Success] What... we... we gotta run! Gotta run real fast! *squee!*
27972 := Gurke? Uh... we gotta... uh... gotta go somewhere and... wait for me!
27973 := Statement: At your command, master: Gamorrean stew!
27974 := Hey, don't push your luck, fellas.
27975 := Yeah, maybe you kills a dragon, but you are scared of us!
27976 := Uh... we aren't in your way, right? We don't want to... uh... get you mad or nothing.
27977 := Shh, Gurke! Your voice maybe annoys them!
27978 := I hopes not. *snort*
27979 := Yeah, that would be bad.
27980 := I knew we were getting set up! Cut them up! We gots no choice!
27981 := Sharina Nal thinks you may have killed her husband.
27982 := I'm inclined to believe her. You won't escape justice.
27983 := Watch your tongues, piggies, or I'll rip them out!
27984 := How about I buy you a drink? Will that keep you happy?
27985 := Now, no need for us to fight. This is just friendly bravado.
27986 := Or I slaughter you where you stand! Want to risk it?
27987 := Keep your temper, I just want to ask some questions.
27988 := What if I wanted advice? I'm sure you are very smart.
27989 := Fine, I'll just leave.
27990 := I'm looking for something. Are you good scouts?
27991 := So, can I ask what you do?
27992 := I wanted to ask questions about you and hunting.
27993 := The other hunters say you shouldn't be trusted.
27994 := Why don't you let him speak?
27995 := Some of the other hunters say you don't know how to hunt.
27996 := I'm leaving.
27997 := I've changed my mind. I think I'll have to hurt you now.
27998 := You're out of time, piggies. I'll cut you limb from limb!
27999 := [Force Persuade] Run away, piggie. Run away screaming.
28000 := See you later, boys.
28001 := Sorry boys, I've changed my mind. I'm going to hurt you now.
28002 := Hmm? You know, I don't have that much to tell you. You really have to learn the dunes for yourself.
28003 := Why are you here, swoop jock? Hunting doesn't give your kind the instant thrills you need, does it?
28004 := Yes, is there something you wish, human?
28005 := You talk far too big, human. This isn't the place for such things. Guards are a short yell away.
28006 := There seems to be no reason for your anger, human. You would be wise to control it, lest it bury you.
28007 := No, things are never quite so black and white. I am protected here, as are you. Nothing will come of this.
28008 := Goodbye, human. Perhaps we will meet again, but I sincerely hope not.
28009 := [Failure] Perhaps you are unfamiliar with how things work around here. The guards are always quick to act.
28010 := [Success] Of course the guards would take their time getting here... I don't wish trouble.
28011 := It is unfortunate that you would choose this course, human. You never know when you will need an ally.
28012 := I see no harm in it. There are hours yet before I set back out on the dunes.
28013 := I will answer, though it is rare for one of you swoop riders to show much interest in anything besides racing.
28014 := Spare me the flattery, human. Such talk is rarely sincere.
28015 := Good hunting.
28016 := No one that will return your questions. To truly know the dunes you have to live there, as the Sand People do.
28017 := Only they truly explore the land, but they attack without debate, if you see them at all.
28018 := The Jawas may know the land as well, but are more interested in trading than talking. They scavenge to escape jobs akin to slavery.
28019 := Their language is difficult. If you can get anything more than the price of a droid out of them, I'll be impressed.
28020 := The Sand People carry nothing but weapons and bloodlust. To them, outsiders are invaders to be repelled.
28021 := Once or twice, however, I have seen them emerge from older ruins with sacks and other containers.
28022 := I've always been driven off, and if I examine the site later, there is nothing left.
28023 := They were old storehouses of some kind, but you couldn't find them now, human. The sand covers all.
28024 := The only ones who would know what was there are the Sand People, and you would have to take it by force.
28025 := Finding their encampment is easy enough. Walk south until you are attacked.
28026 := I am Komad Fortuna, a hunter and member of this lodge. It is not the life for everyone, but I am content.
28027 := You are in dire need of better entertainment, human. My life has not changed since we last spoke.
28028 := I will answer. The day drags on, however.
28029 := Probably not as much as you would learn speaking to them yourself, even if they tell you nothing.
28030 := The most obvious are the Gamorreans, however. Gurke and his crew are not the best company.
28031 := They hunt, but often come back with salvage instead of hides or pearls. I think their prey walks upright.
28032 := The dunes are far from the reach of their blasters. Besides, Gurke spends his money in company stores.
28033 := Ah... put simply, Dorak Quinn is honorable. Tanis Venn is not so much, but I've no real quarrel with him.
28034 := But, perhaps you are safer speaking with me. You've shown a weakness in the face of... two-legged predators.
28035 := Perhaps you should reassert yourself? I don't know. I didn't think the Gamorreans so threatening.
28036 := You have already shown an understanding of the needed skills when dealing with predators. 
28037 := Having dealt with the Gamorreans, I think there is little else that will phase you.
28038 := A decade? Two? I don't enslave myself to time, human. There is day and there is night.
28039 := Tatooine will not change in my lifetime. Why bother trying to keep up with the rolling of the years? 
28040 := The best hunting is wherever the best hunter is. It's a trite answer, human, but the only one I can give.
28041 := It depends on what you seek. Wraid are plentiful and are the spoils of the sport hunter. Dragons appear only to the true hunter.
28042 := Patience is key. Krayt dragons hunt alone, and their prey is whatever can catch their attention.
28043 := They are both rare and dangerous, and an honor to hunt. If you survive, you are blessed and favored. Respect them.
28044 := Some try to lessen the risk by mass-hunting with battle droids. I would rather hunt solo, taking the risk as my own.
28045 := I will not speak of it while they live. It is their shame to admit or hide. They know the effect it has.
28046 := Perhaps they will kill so many wraid that they also kill the hunt. After that, perhaps the solo hunter will still prosper.
28047 := Tanis did, but he no longer hunts, thanks to you. I'm glad a peaceful resolution was found.
28048 := Tanis did, but he appears to be no longer with us. Perhaps you already knew this, human? I can't say.
28049 := Our hunt proved it. We found a dragon where other hunters should have noticed. It will be the last one seen for a long time.
28050 := They are elusive. Perhaps they sensibly avoid the places where their kind have died. I don't know.
28051 := I'm just glad we found him him using the old ways. That was a victory.
28052 := Save your words, swoop rider. They do not suit you. 
28053 := You have no place here with me, human. Leave me to my thoughts.
28054 := Greetings again, hunter. Your time out on the dunes has brought wear to your face. It is a trait that you and I share. 
28055 := Probably from worry at getting your hands dirty. I really don't have much to talk to you about. You are not my kin.
28056 := It is the weight of decisions made for the good of all. I don't think the others would understand. All they know is that a dragon is dead. I am content to leave it at that.
28057 := Yes, what will you pay for me not to kill you?
28058 := Perhaps you are right. You are safe... for now.
28059 := Pay me or end up dead. It's that simple.
28060 := [Force Persuade] They wouldn't get here in time. Pay me.
28061 := Just a few questions, if that's all right?
28062 := Information, if I could trouble such a worthy hunter for a moment.
28063 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
28064 := I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?
28065 := What about the Jawas?
28066 := Have you ever seen the Sand People with anything odd?
28067 := What kinds of ruins were these? Where were they?
28068 := Who are you? What do you do?
28069 := I want to ask about you and hunting.
28070 := Let's go back to my first questions.
28071 := What can you tell me about the other hunters?
28072 := Wouldn't the guards have something to say about that?
28073 := What about the hunters besides the Gamorreans?
28074 := How long have you been at this?
28075 := You really don't know anymore?
28076 := Where is the best hunting?
28077 := So dragons are rare? Are they dangerous?
28078 := Who uses battle droids?
28079 := Why are such large beasts so hard to find?
28080 := Your traditional methods aren't popular?
28081 := Don't you interrupt my drinking. Gurke gots more patience. Go bother him.
28082 := Ha! Little baby come back to talk? Maybe Gurke can stand your whimpering, but not me. Get lost.
28083 := You... you go deal with Gurke, maybe. I don't want any more trouble. Not even a little.
28084 := Gurke said no more talking. You got sand in your ears? No more talking.
28085 := Hello again. Something else I can do for you? Slow night? Day? Whatever?
28086 := Hello again. Tired of the swoop track? What can I do for you?
28087 := Well, hello dragon killer! I should have you deal with the wife. You know, because she's scary? Like a dragon? Ah, forget it.
28088 := What can I do for you, hmm? Did my wife send you? This ain't about credits, is it?
28089 := Whoa, what did you say? You know, I come here because the guards stop your kind of trouble before it starts.
28090 := It's more annoying than anything. You shouldn't make threats you don't want returned. Bad move.
28091 := Well, actually, they probably are, but I'll save you the trouble of testing it. I'm leaving.
28092 := I'm not wasting ammunition on a fight with you. I've wraid to hunt. We meet on the dunes... you watch out.
28093 := [Failure] Uh, no I don't and no I don't. What do you think you are, a Jedi? Heh. That's a laugh.
28094 := [Success] You seem like a good sort. Here, how about I buy you a few rounds?
28095 := Wait... I never do that. Why... why does my head hurt? Something strange is going on here.
28096 := I'm leaving. I don't much like newcomers anyway.
28097 := Everyone is looking for something, I suppose one of us should get it. Ask away.
28098 := I'll answer, but since when do you swoop riders show much interest in anything besides speed?
28099 := Oh, of course. Who put you up to this? My wife? I meant what I said about having no credits.
28100 := Good hunting.
28101 := You hurry back any old time, darling. Anytime.
28102 := Who knows the planet? I don't know. I guess the Sand People. I'm usually running when I see them, though.
28103 := Smart traders. They've salvaged and sold me my own damaged droids once or twice. 
28104 := They don't say much I can understand. I think they're a little slow, but who am I to judge, huh? Ha!
28105 := Uh, sure, my blood. They almost got me last year. Tore up two of my battle droids. The wife was mad about that. Heh. Took her weeks to fix.
28106 := Where they got weapons to cut battle armor, I don't know. They act like animals, but they can surprise you.
28107 := I don't know. Pick a dune and walk, they'll get you soon enough.
28108 := Well, darling, old Tanis might be just what you need. Unless you mean the dunes. I suppose only the Sand People really know them.
28109 := It's serious business. I'm sure I can help you through it.
28110 := Ah, the old girl doesn't understand me. Her loss. Now, you have questions about Sand People or something?
28111 := He seems pretty forward, period.
28112 := Ooh, you're a sour one. Loosen up, we're all friends here.
28113 := Perhaps you had best turn your thoughts back to your wife, sir.
28114 := I'm sure I can help you. Ask away.
28115 := Well, my name is Tanis and what I do is hunt. I'm sure you've heard of me... well, actually, I hope you haven't.
28116 := Again? Nothing has changed. It's all just as dirty and tedious as it was before.
28117 := Hunting is a dirty and tough business. What can old Tanis tell you about it?
28118 := Fine, fine, whatever you want.
28119 := Uptight and cold, like my wife. They don't like me streamlining the hunt with droids. I don't fit in, but I don't let it bug me.
28120 := The Gamorreans are different. Good rowdy drinking buddies. Gurke and his boys, they understand that hunting is a business.
28121 := Of course, they hunt... other things than wraid too. Just don't turn your back on them. Ever.
28122 := Nothing, nothing at all. Just keep your eyes on them. That's all.
28123 := Dorak is reasonable. Komad is a pain, but he keeps his distance. I can tell he doesn't like me much.
28124 := Ask around the lodge if you want information about the other guys. I don't really talk to them much.
28125 := But I suppose you would want me to do whatever they say. I heard how you rolled over for Gurke and his boys.
28126 := That's not the way to establish yourself, you know? It's hard to earn respect here.
28127 := You know how it is, you don't take any backtalk either. I heard about you and Gurke. I should have you deal with my wife.
28128 := Ah, she doesn't understand me. You know the drill. It's not my fault; she knew who I was when she married me.
28129 := Too long, but it beats smuggling. You ever run into a Sith dreadnaught in the desert? No, you haven't.
28130 := Hell, I married her. Ha ha ha! No, no, seriously now, I had this friend that crossed Sith-space and got stripped of everything. 
28131 := It's not like I have much now, I guess, but I still prefer Sand People to getting ambushed on unproven trade routes.
28132 := Ah, she doesn't understand me. You know the drill. It's not my fault; she knew who I was when she married me.
28133 := There isn't any. Too many hunters, not enough prey. I can barely keep expenses covered. Maintenance on battle droids is expensive.
28134 := Of course, it's better than going alone. What if I stumbled on a bunch of Sand People? These solo hunters are crazy.
28135 := What do I care? I need to eat. I also need to pay for parts so the wife can keep the droids running. It's all about the credits.
28136 := Some guys will talk about honor and stuff, but they still sell their plates to Fazza. I guess honor needs creds too?
28137 := I suppose, but so what? When that resource goes belly-up, I'll just move on. I'm just a wandering spirit, I guess.
28138 := I'm not real popular with the others, but they just fool themselves. They're in it for the credits too.
28139 := Hmph. Hunting a species to extinction. Now there's a logical way to make a living.
28140 := I'm more the practical type, beautiful. I keep myself fed and make sure everything I have is taken care of.
28141 := You're the one that took down a dragon! What could I possibly tell you? My battle droids can't even fight that good.
28142 := Sure you do. Tanis can tell you all about the thrill of the hunt, man versus beast. It's all very exciting.
28143 := What, specifically, would you like me to cover?
28144 := Well, the wife doesn't really take much of an interest in my work. Not like you. Now, you have questions?
28145 := I'll do my best to make you happy. Ask away.
28146 := I don't hunt anymore. I made a deal with you, and I'll stick to it. The others will have to help you.
28147 := Besides... without the wife I can't keep my droids going. But I don't need her. You can tell her that. Yeah.
28148 := Ooh, candy words from a swoop racer. Well, I just feel all warm inside. Save it for the ladies, what do you want?
28149 := Well of course, darling, whatever Tanis Venn can do. You know, very few human females come to Tatooine...
28150 := Ask your questions. Please.
28151 := Grrrr!
28152 := Uh, and even fewer accompanied by Wookiees. Whoa big fella. You related to my wife? Now, w-what did you say you wanted?
28153 := Hey! You talk to her with a bit of respect in your voice or you'll end this conversation minus a few teeth! Got it?
28154 := Hey, hey, hey, let's calm down, shall we? No offense was meant. You just go ahead and ask your questions.
28155 := [Force Persuade] Just answer the lady's questions.
28156 := [Success] I should just answer the lady's questions.
28157 := I only meant to help him clear his thoughts. He's confused if he'll mention a wife and then act like that... the greasy little scavenger.
28158 := I have no doubt. I just don't like him. Mentions his wife and then acts like that.
28159 := I thought it obvious. Should he act like that after mentioning his wife? Greasy little wrench-rat. He asked for it.
28160 := I have to thank you again. You really didn't have to save my sorry carcass out there. I appreciate it.
28161 := Not that it puts me in debt to you. Because I believe I mentioned how little this job pays.
28162 := You know, darling... if there was anything I could do to make it up to you... anything? No, huh?
28163 := You can give me credits before I decide to kill you.
28164 := Give me credits before I kill you.
28165 := Maybe it is. What is your life worth?
28166 := I didn't mean anything. Just scaring you.
28167 := Not fast enough to stop me killing you.
28168 := [Force Persuade] You like me. You want to give me credits.
28169 := I'm just looking to ask a few questions.
28170 := I'm looking for experts. You seem knowledgeable.
28171 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
28172 := I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?
28173 := What about the Jawas?
28174 := Have you ever seen the Sand People with anything odd?
28175 := Where did this happen?
28176 := Relax, loverboy. Just answer my questions.
28177 := You are pretty forward for a married man.
28178 := I want to ask who you are and what it is you do.
28179 := I want to ask about you and hunting.
28180 := Let's go back to my first questions.
28181 := What can you tell me about the other hunters?
28182 := What are you suggesting?
28183 := What about the hunters besides the Gamorreans?
28184 := You go on about your wife a lot. What's the deal?
28185 := How long have you been at this?
28186 := You crossed paths with a Sith dreadnaught?
28187 := You go on about your wife a lot. What's the deal?
28188 := Where is the best hunting?
28189 := You hunt with battle droids? Is that sporting?
28190 := Don't you need to take more kills to keep your droids running?
28191 := Keep your cool, loverboy. Just answer my questions.
28192 := You're pretty forward for a married man.
28193 := Jolee! Leave him alone! I'll talk to him myself!
28194 := Ha! Thanks, Jolee, but I'm sure I can handle him.
28195 := Jolee! Why did you do that?
28196 := It not my fault we are here. You blame Gurke if you gotta, not me.
28197 := You go away, humee. Cry to Gurke if you gotta talk. I don't care.
28198 := Uh... I got nothing to say to you. Maybe Gurke do, but that his business.
28199 := You smell that? That's bantha... or maybe it's the new hunters.
28200 := Heh... Jawas don't bounce good. 
28201 := Bah! Tube-heads can't hunt. Why they allowed here?
28202 := Too many new humees in town.
28203 := Maybe we hunt everything tomorrow. Nobody else gets anything!
28204 := What you looking at, hah? *snort*
28205 := Gurke is through with you, and so is me.
28206 := Dorak
28207 := Quinn
28208 := Fazza
28209 := Utral
28210 := Gurke

28222 := Tatooine - Swoop Registration
28223 := That was a hard fought run, but still a little slow.
28224 := A great effort, but just not enough.
28225 := Early mistakes cost some time on that run. That's gotta hurt, folks.
28226 := Just squeaked in under the last time. A very good run.
28227 := Those mods are paying off. A much better run!
28228 := A top-tier run! Excellent time!
28229 := This run won't be officially timed, but let's give'em a hand anyway.
28230 := A lot of work has been put into this bike, but can the driver make it perform? Timers, get ready!
28231 := This driver's had a string of losses. Let's see if they can't get back on track today.
28232 := Another driver coming up whose been practicing out in the canyons like most locals.
28233 := Another swoop on the line. Get your timers ready.
28234 := Looks like we've got another racer up on the line. Let's see how they go.
28235 := Ah, it's you again. So, is this about racing or business? One or the other, I've got no time for anything else.
28236 := Yes, you'll be wanting to race. I'm sure you'll give the swoop fans a good show.
28237 := Looking to make up for your previous disgrace? If you keep losing, I'll have to reconsider letting you on my track.
28238 := Very well, but you've already proven your skill on my track. What else do you want?
28239 := Oh, no, I'm not talking to you about that anymore. I agree to strange things when you are around, that's for sure.
28240 := Nico's got the best deal I've ever given, no lie. Now leave so I can figure out how to still make money off this.
28241 := Yes, the contract trouble I've been having. Have you talked to the boy? You don't get paid until he signs.
28242 := Hehe, nothing to talk about, friend. You made sure that Nico signed the best contract I've ever come up with.
28243 := Everyone's happy too. He gets to race and I get almost everything he wins. I love swoop racing.
28244 := What? You again? Look, are you here to race or aren't you? I don't have time for anything else. What good are you?
28245 := Who are you? Ah, nobody. What do you want, huh? Handouts? Go dig a mine, fool.
28246 := Yeah, you do that. I've got business to work on. Big business!
28247 := Hmm, what's that? A spine? Well now, that sets you above most of the scrub-hacks I meet in a day.
28248 := Let's have a look at you. Hmm... just a human... nothing really special. You race? Maybe own a swoop?
28249 := You got a bike, then you can race. I don't care about experience, so long as you can get out on the track.
28250 := And if you crash and burn, that's your problem. I just need warm bodies to pad the roster between the pros.
28251 := Err... there is the matter of a small track maintenance fee... 100 credits.
28252 := [Success] You don't need to pay the fee. It's just a formality. I'll let you use the track for practice and set up your first official race right away.
28253 := [Failure] What are you trying to do, bankrupt me? It costs money to run this place! 
28254 := [Success] Well, I suppose you're right, but I'm not dropping it the whole amount. 50 credits. That's it.
28255 := If you don't have the confidence to win back the money you give me, why should I care if you race or not!
28256 := Bah! Pay it or leave, that's the deal.
28257 := Then you don't race! I pay out good money to encourage competition. I need to make it back somehow.
28258 := Good! That shows you mean business. Now you can use the track for recreational runs, or I can give you an official race right away.
28259 := Just ask me when you want to start and... there's some business I need help with... if you're serious about promoting racing.
28260 := All right, but don't make me regret giving you track access. I need racers that race!
28261 := Go then, but don't hog the track with rec-runs. I need my pros to keep their skills up. You depress them.
28262 := The track crosses the dunes of Tatooine. You will race against times set by other racers. There will be no other swoops on the track.
28263 := Your bike likely has the standard five gears to shift through. As your speed increases, watch the indicators in the lower left to know when to shift.
28264 := Shift at the wrong time and your swoop will accelerate poorly or slow down. Shift correctly and you will optimize your perfomance.
28265 := You can also steer over "swoop boosters" placed along the route. These will increase your speed substantially for a short time.
28266 := There are obstacles that you must watch for. Steering over rocks won't damage your bike, but it will slow you down.
28267 := Ah, I set up a quick three-tier system so people know where they stand. I pay for the first time to reach each tier.
28268 := Hurry it up, I don't have all day.
28269 := There aren't a lot of pro racers *anywhere* with Taris gone. I'm going to try and build up one or two of my own.
28270 := But, I suppose there are a couple of pros here. Some "has-been" and "never-were" types. That sort of thing.
28271 := Zoriis Bafka is the best of the lot, outside my local champ Nico. Most racers in her league never stop here.
28272 := Tier one is 10 racing bonds. Tier two I pay 30 racing bonds. Tier three I give 80 racing bonds. You'll agree the amount is fair.
28273 := I pay each level only once. I'm not here to support you. I only pay to encourage constant improvement.
28274 := Racing bonds are monetary notes I issue so vendors know who my friends are. Any merchant will buy them.
28275 := Each bond is worth 60 credits, give or take. It depends on the merchant.
28276 := Tier one here is strictly amateurs. Might get a good race out of them now and then, but they aren't going anywhere.
28277 := Reach Tier two and you show promise. You're still fodder for the pros, but you're pretty good.
28278 := Tier three... only one of my local guys in that range. Nico. Good chance to go pro... if he knows what's good for him.
28279 := Here on Tatooine we do things Motta's way. With Taris gone, there's no circuit governing organization to say I am wrong.
28280 := For you? Nothing. I've already paid you for all three tiers. There's no more. Nothing. Go hit another track.
28281 := You've passed the first tier and have earned 10 racing bonds. Not a bad showing for a beginner. You beat Garm's time easily.
28282 := Take this, with my thanks. We'll see if you can do any better in tier two.
28283 := You passed the second tier and have earned 30 racing bonds. I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to sign you up.
28284 := I suppose you'll be up against my local pro attractions in tier three next. You've already ruined Yuka Rill.
28285 := It's a big payout for you. You shattered my track record and took tier three. 80 racing bonds was the deal.
28286 := That's the last I'll be giving you, I hope. You're too fast for most of my racers.
28287 := I give rewards for winning, not flitting around like you're chasing womp rats. My three tier system is not for the weak of skill.
28288 := Fine, fine. We'll have your bike brought to the starting position. Let's see what level of race we should give you.
28289 := You'll go against Garm Totryl's time in the first tier. He's a local boy new to the sport. The time to beat is <CUSTOM27>.
28290 := Swoop racing fans, we have an official race about to commence! Make some noise for this new contender!
28291 := Well, you made it past the first tier, so let's try the second. Yuka Rill is the current leader. The time to beat is <CUSTOM28>.
28292 := Attention! A second tier race is about to begin! Show your support for this up and comer!
28293 := Hmm... it's time to put you up against tier three. Let's see how you do against Zoriis Bafka, a pro. The time to beat is <CUSTOM29>.
28294 := Attention! Motta the Hutt presents the cream of swoop racing, a tier three match! Let this almost-champion know what you expect!
28295 := Sorry now, I can't do that. You've won all three tiers and I'm not putting you in any more officially timed runs.
28296 := I don't want my racers getting discouraged... and I don't have much interest in signing you. I think you'd be... difficult.
28297 := Anyway, if you want to do any recreational races just for practice, talk to the track coordinator. He'll set you up.
28298 := Patience. I still owe you for your last race. Let's settle that debt before we go any further.
28299 := I admire that you are so eager to get back out there after your loss. Let's hope you do better. I'll have your bike placed in position.
28300 := I make my money off of signing good racers. Good ones, not great ones. I want them young and stupid.
28301 := I've got one. Nico Senvi. Great potential. Only started racing a year ago and loves it. He lives for it now.
28302 := What I want is simple. I want Nico to sign a contract with me, and I want you to convince him. I'll pay well.
28303 := He'll be great one day, I can tell. There are some pros here, but I'm not looking for experience. I want potential.
28304 := Besides, he's young. He won't give me trouble like the older riders, or someone like you.
28305 := How does... 20 racing bonds sound? That should cover all your swoop costs on Tatooine nicely.
28306 := I'll make it all back if he signs the deal. I know it.
28307 := Racing bonds are monetary notes I issue so local vendors know who my friends are. Any vendor on Tatooine will buy them.
28308 := They are worth ten times their number in credits, and sometimes more. It depends on how much of a friend you are.
28309 := He doesn't trust me. Actually, none of them do. I'm the promoter. I do it for money. They all just want the glory.
28310 := You're a swoop-jock like him. You're new, but if you win enough he'll respect you. I'm counting on it.
28311 := And if he doesn't, *make* him choose correctly. You look like you could scare some sense into him.
28312 := I'm sure they wouldn't mind *some* of the credits, as opposed to getting it stolen out of their pockets.
28313 := I bet you just can't understand why they wouldn't trust someone who's only in it for the money, too.
28314 := Money's honest, old man. More honest than a conniving Jedi.
28315 := You know, for a brute you say the sweetest things.
28316 := The deal basically says that I fund his bike and repairs, but in return I take a *hefty* cut of his winnings.
28317 := He knows it's harsh, but he can't afford to go pro on his own and he doesn't want to give up racing.
28318 := I've got him where I want him. I just need you to give him a little push in the right direction. Or a big shove.
28319 := You do that. It's for the best. Now, was there something else?
28320 := No, no, you are a representative, and you'll be his friend. Let him know what the right choice is.
28321 := It's the best way. I'll be here if you change your mind. Now, was there something else?
28322 := Right. Tell me why we're talking to this guy again?
28323 := You're not going to pull that typical swoop-jockey attitude, are you? This is business, and I know what's best.
28324 := What do you care whether I make money off the kid or not? He wants to race and you'll get paid. We all win.
28325 := Anchorhead is a safe town. I don't think you'll be able to do much of anything to me around here.
28326 := Now, if you've got nothing else but empty threats, I think we're done.
28327 := [Success] Of course, guards can't be everywhere. I'd prefer to avoid a fight, I think. I'll fix this.
28328 := [Failure] I'm not afraid of you. Now, if you aren't going to get Nico to sign the deal, just go away.
28329 := [Success] You do have a point about that, and the guards can't be everywhere. Perhaps I should rethink this.
28330 := [Force Persuade] I have heard enough. You want to act in a fair manner. Now.
28331 := [Success] Of course it would be fairer if I gave him a better deal. Did I say that? Wait, I guess it does make sense.
28332 := *ahem* Do as we say, scoundrel! You don't want to anger a shortempered Jedi!
28333 := Jedi... you're Jedi? I'll do this just so you leave. Who knows what you'll have me saying with your "waving hands."
28334 := Threat: Guards give up, meatbag. Assassin droids will hunt your whole family tree. Reconsider.
28335 := Well... an assassin droid, you say. No reasoning with them. Maybe... I was a little hasty.
28336 := Never underestimate a Mandalorian. If I want, there won't be enough of you left to identify.
28337 := A... a Mandalorian? May... maybe I was a bit hasty.
28338 := I think otherwise! RRRAAAAARRRGGGHHH!!
28339 := Okay, maybe... maybe I was a little hasty. I don't know what he said but I... I get the drift.
28340 := [Failure] No, no I don't. What is this, a joke? Quit fooling around, I mean business.
28341 := [Success] Of course I could just give him a better deal. Did I say that? Wait, I guess it does make sense.
28342 := His times *have* suffered since I made the offer. I mean, swoop-jocks are moody. They feel bad, they don't win.
28343 := [Failure] I don't think you would. It would taint the racers that won on my track. That incudes Nico, and others.
28344 := [Success] You wouldn't. That would be bad. Very bad. Even rumors like that could keep me out of the pro circuit.
28345 := All right, I'll give him a better deal and make it back in the long run, I guess. You, of course, are not getting paid!
28346 := I trust this is the last I will have to hear about this matter? Was there anything else?
28347 := I thought he would. Very good. I'll have him training off this barren rock as soon as possible. He'll make me rich. 
28348 := Now, I think I offered 20 racing bonds for the job. I'm happy to pay it.
28349 := We had a deal. It was fair and I don't see why you need more.
28350 := Anchorhead is a safe town. I don't think you'll be able to do much of anything to me around here.
28351 := Now, if you've got nothing else but empty threats, I think we're done. Is there anything else?
28352 := [Success] Of course, guards can't be everywhere. I'd prefer to avoid a fight, I think. I'll fix this.
28353 := [Failure] I'm not afraid of you. You've been paid all that you will be paid. Now, is there anything else?
28354 := [Success] You do have a point about that, and the guards can't be everywhere. Perhaps I should rethink this.
28355 := *ahem* Do as we say, scoundrel! You don't want to anger a shortempered Jedi!
28356 := Jedi... you're Jedi? I'll do this just so you leave. Who knows what you'll have me saying with your "waving hands."
28357 := Threat: Guards give up, meatbag. Assassin droids will hunt your whole family tree. Reconsider.
28358 := Well... an assassin droid, you say. No reasoning with them. Maybe... I was a little hasty.
28359 := Never underestimate a Mandalorian. If I want, there won't be enough of you left to identify.
28360 := A... a Mandalorian? May... maybe I was a bit hasty.
28361 := I think otherwise! RRRAAAAARRRGGGHHH!!
28362 := Okay, maybe... maybe I was a little hasty. I don't know what he said but I... I get the drift.
28363 := [Success] I'd... really like to pay you more. I think I can manage something. I don't know why I was arguing.
28364 := [Failure] Look, I paid you all that I plan to. That's it. Is there anything else?
28365 := [Success] I suppose I don't. No one would sign with me again. I'm sure we can come to an agreement.
28366 := I'll pay you half again what I said, and that's all. Now, I have to plan for Nico's training. Is there anything else?
28367 := You've taken a lot of money from me already, winning each tier like you have. This is it. There's no more.
28368 := He'll be the best there is one day, and I'll own him. Now, is there anything else?
28369 := More slavery. Just disguised.
28370 := That isn't fair! On Taris you had to give a cut to the swoop gang sponsoring you, but at least the rider got the higher share of the winnings.
28371 := And you're surprised that the boy doesn't want to sign?
28372 := And? It sounds like you have something special. What do you want help with?
28373 := That's great. Except I don't care. Let me rephrase the important part of my question. Do you own your own swoop?
28374 := Ha! You and twelve other liars. Planet blows up, race records are lost, and now everyone is a champion!
28375 := Okay, okay, enough of the funny stuff. You think you're a racer, you'll be one. You have your own bike?
28376 := Nobody here can compare with the racers you rode against on Taris. You'll wipe every record from the books on this backwater track!
28377 := My friend tells the truth. I am a Jedi... are you going to imply that I am lying, as well?
28378 := Ho ho! Now you are champion and travel with Jedi? Does the story get bigger with every telling?
28379 := Not interested in helping. Only interested in racing. I get enough beggars through here looking for money.
28380 := Let's talk about swoop racing.
28381 := Let's talk about that business with Nico.
28382 := Well, I'll just say goodbye then.
28383 := You will show me respect, worm!
28384 := I'm not interested in this. Goodbye.
28385 := I have my own bike stored on my ship.
28386 := [Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the fee.
28387 := [Persuade] Why not drop the fee? No racers means no crowds.
28388 := I can't pay that amount either.
28389 := I'll pay the 50 credits.
28390 := I can't pay that much.
28391 := I'll pay it.
28392 := I'll be back later.
28393 := Give me the basics on how to race.
28394 := Are there any hazards on the track?
28395 := I want the reward for winning my last race.
28396 := I want to talk about the rewards for racing.
28397 := Let's go back to my other questions.
28398 := Are there any pro racers here?
28399 := What does each tier pay?
28400 := What are racing bonds?
28401 := Explain what the different tiers are.
28402 := Why aren't rounds used, like on Manaan?
28403 := Just set me up with a race.
28404 := What sort of business do you need help with?
28405 := Aren't there other racers? Why him?
28406 := What will you pay me?
28407 := What are racing bonds?
28408 := Why would he listen to me?
28409 := Why won't he sign?
28410 := I'll see what I can do.
28411 := I'm not interested in being your enforcer.
28412 := Let's go back to some basic questions about Nico.
28413 := I think you should give him a better deal.
28414 := You give him a better deal or I bury you under your track!
28415 := [Force Persuade] You know I could hurt you. Do as I say.
28416 := [Persuade] You hired me to bully *for* you. I'm no less a threat now.
28417 := [Force Persuade] You want to give Nico a better deal!
28418 := [Persuade] Treat him fairly or I'll start rumors your races are rigged.
28419 := I talked to him. He's willing to sign.
28420 := You'll give me more or you will regret it.
28421 := I think I should ask for more.
28422 := Then I'll have to take it out of your hide!
28423 := [Force Persuade] You know I could hurt you. Do as I say.
28424 := [Persuade] You hired me to bully *for* you. I'm no less a threat now.
28425 := [Force Persuade] You will pay me more and like it.
28426 := [Persuade] I'm worth more. You wouldn't want word of this getting out.
28427 := All right, it's enough.
28428 := That will be fine. Good luck.
28429 := I have some experience.
28430 := I raced on Manaan.
28431 := I raced on Taris. I won the season opener there.
28432 := I'm looking for information. Can you help?
28433 := What do you want? Nothing from me, that's for sure. Take a walk.
28434 := Hi again. Something I can do for you? I'm just waiting for a crack at the track.
28435 := You are crazy-fast, you know that? I saw your races and... well, I'm just amazed. What do you need?
28436 := I hear you are moving up. I'll be that good, someday.
28437 := Wow, you're pretty good. I mean, I'm just a swoop-kid starting out, but you blew past my time easy.
28438 := Hi there. You waiting for a slot on the track? Me too. There's lots of racers coming through here now.
28439 := New swoop jocks like me don't get much respect. Just takes practice, I guess.
28440 := Uh, I didn't mean anything. I don't want any trouble.
28441 := Right... trying to prove that you can push around some kid swoop jock? I don't need this.
28442 := I'm not waiting around for you to snap. I'm no fighter. I just race.
28443 := Hey! I'm not looking to fight. You want to race when my turn comes around, you pay the fee and go ahead.
28444 := Hey, come on. I don't want any trouble. Here, take what little I have. Just don't hurt me.
28445 := No need to get like that. I don't have any track time coming up anyway.
28446 := Sure, but you signed up, didn't you? If you've got any experience you probably know everything I'd tell you anyway.
28447 := Well sure, but I don't know much besides the track. You even interested in the swoop track?
28448 := Race hard, watch for rocks.
28449 := Anyone but us swoop racers. Really, we can show you the track, but anything else, we've got no clue.
28450 := You could check with the Czerka office. They like to think they know everything.
28451 := What's so interesting about me that you keep asking? I'm just a kid racer.
28452 := Heck, nobody is ever interested in me. I'm the new guy, Garm Totryl. Pleased to meet you.
28453 := Sure. I don't think I'll be getting much track time anyway.
28454 := You should ask them yourself. I don't feel right speaking for the pros. I'm the new guy to them.
28455 := I doubt they'll have much to say to you, either. After that stuff with Nico, seems you're more a promotor than a racer.
28456 := You could talk to anyone now, after helping Nico like you did. You've made some friends, for sure.
28457 := It's not my place to talk. I'd be nervous even talking about Nico. He's young like me, but he's practically a prodigy. 
28458 := Everyone thinks he's the next star of the pro circuit... if he signs with a promoter. Motta is really pushing him.
28459 := I hear that the deal is pretty bad, but I'd take it in a second. I don't have Nico's skill, though.
28460 := Not that long. Just this season. I'm getting better... still too cautious. Good thing I've some pros to learn from.
28461 := How they keep their nerves steady, bike maintenance. You know, all of it. I'm not as good as some, but I try.
28462 := Ha! You're kidding, right? Every racer here would rather be someplace else, but this is it for most of us.
28463 := Taris blowing up has messed up the swoop circuit. People are just looking for somewhere to keep their skills sharp.
28464 := It sounds weird, doesn't it? Worrying about racing when all those people died? Nothing we can do.
28465 := Motta pays for timekeeping and official records. You can race anywhere, but here, if you do good, it actually matters.
28466 := That's why I stick around. No work, no future, but Tatooine at least has this. It's my shot... maybe.
28467 := You're running some great races out there. You beat mine, anyway. I'll be that good someday.
28468 := You're the best I've seen in a while, though. Maybe even better than Nico. That's pretty impressive.
28469 := What makes you think you know anything about me, worm?
28470 := Sure, just kidding you. But you be careful...
28471 := Maybe I'm tired of your face. Maybe I'll remove it!
28472 := How about you pay me to leave you alone.
28473 := Yeah, yeah, follow your dreams. Just answer my questions, kid.
28474 := I've a few things I wanted to ask. Spare a moment?
28475 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
28476 := I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?
28477 := I want to ask about you and racing.
28478 := Let's go back to my first questions.
28479 := What can you tell me about the other racers?
28480 := What makes you say that?
28481 := What do you think about that?
28482 := How long have you been at this?
28483 := What do you want to learn?
28484 := Is this the best place for racing?
28485 := Why have racers come here?
28486 := Go on, leave me alone. I've got stuff to worry about.
28487 := You don't know. Don't go thinking you know, because you don't know. I've got problems.
28488 := I don't feel like answering. I wouldn't be much help to you anyway. I just race. Don't know about anything else.
28489 := You race, right? Know anything about contracts? Ah, I shouldn't get into it. It's my problem.
28490 := Deal with that Hutt Motta and you'll understand. Until then, I just don't want to talk about it.
28491 := Racer stuff. Nothing you'd understand. Don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of secret.
28492 := Ha! Sure! Race your bike out of that explosion? Everyone knows that the whole planet is gone. Nobody got out.
28493 := I'm not in the mood for jokes, thanks. I've got things to think about. You wouldn't know anything about it.
28494 := Oh, hi. You another racer then? I heard someone new was talking to Motta. Always room for more, I guess.
28495 := Nice job beating my times, too. I guess my heart isn't in the racing. Contracts are distracting stuff.
28496 := Don't know how much longer I'll be around here, but maybe we'll have time for a few races.
28497 := All right. See you around the track.
28498 := Sorry. I've been here a few years, but only for the racing. Maybe ask over at Fazza's club. The hunters get around.
28499 := Not sure there's much I could tell you. I mean, you have the track record.
28500 := Hurry it up, all right? I have things on my mind.
28501 := Motta has some basic incentives for good times, which you probably know, but this is just an amateur track.
28502 := The pro circuit is where the real credits are, but even that is hurting. I guess a lot of riders were on Taris.
28503 := If there's anything around, it'll be at the Czerka store in their office in the center of town. Stock is scarce on this rock.
28504 := Just a few years. I used to run down in the canyons, but nobody sees you down there. I wanted crowds.
28505 := I've been told I am. I might go pro. I'm looking at some contracts but... that's between me and Motta.
28506 := You have to step up and do it to know anything about it. You'll understand once you post some fast times.
28507 := Did you? I'm not sure that it's any of your business. Top racers keep to their own. I don't know you.
28508 := Maybe if you were better on the track I might feel like talking about it. Someone who can turn out the fast times might understand.
28509 := I suppose you've got a right to know track business, what with the times you've been posting.
28510 := It's not that I'm not grateful. I mean, it would get me into the pros. I don't have the credits to get in on my own.
28511 := Not that I care about credits. I just want to race... but the deal with Motta is pretty bad. He'll get most of what I win.
28512 := You've posted some good times... he might listen to you. I would. I respect you as a racer.
28513 := But... I kind of doubt he'd give me a better deal. He doesn't have to. He is putting up most of the money.
28514 := I doubt there's much you could say. It's not your business anyway. Top racers take care of their own.
28515 := Thanks anyway, but I'll think it through myself.
28516 := It doesn't matter what you think. You don't really know anything about it. Only a top racer would.
28517 := No offense, but you aren't on the boards compared to me. Post some stunners, then we'll talk.
28518 := Don't threaten me. Every racer here will step up to stop you. You aren't one of us. We take care of our own.
28519 := Heh, maybe Motta isn't so sure of himself if he has threaten me. Are we done now? I've thinking to do.
28520 := [Failure] Uh, no. Not until I've given it some thought. What, did you think I would just cave in?
28521 := Now, if you don't mind, I think we're done for now.
28522 := [Success] I... I'll sign the contract. Yeah, I guess that's best. I mean, the deal can't be all bad, right?
28523 := I mean, you'd know, right? And all I want is to race. Who cares about the credits... who cares.
28524 := Thanks for... making things clear. If you don't mind, I think we're done. Goodbye.
28525 := That promoter's going to bleed that poor kid dry... but I guess he's got to learn the only way to get by in this life is to look out for yourself!
28526 := Do you now? You might know a good deal, I guess. You sure know your way around the track.
28527 := What? You're threatening me? I suppose I do need a kick in the tail to make up my mind. Maybe... it's for the best...
28528 := You should not force someone to do what they don't want.
28529 := How is this different than slavery? You push the boy against his will.
28530 := Tsk tsk. Not even willing to expend a bit of effort in actual persuasion, hey? Well, you do what you like.
28531 := Forcing the boy to sign his life away? Is that really necessary?
28532 := [Failure] I'm still not liking the sound of it. I just don't know.
28533 := [Success] I suppose I do. Not much chance I'll get off this rock on my own, now is there?
28534 := You did? I don't believe it. I mean, I do, but I sure wasn't expecting it. I appreciate it. I really do.
28535 := Now I can take my bike to the big races. There's not much of a circuit right now, but I'll be ready when it recovers.
28536 := Thanks again. I meant it.
28537 := Hard to tell. I'll get some more runs here first. I need the practice. I have to top *your* time.
28538 := I'm impressed, helping a kid like Nico off to a decent start. Good job.
28539 := You again? I don't really feel like talking right now.
28540 := I have to thank you, you know? I don't know how you did it. I really don't.
28541 := Leave me alone, will you. I've got things on my mind.
28542 := Poor baby. Make me care.
28543 := I just have some questions.
28544 := Anything I could help you with? What's bugging you?
28545 := I raced on Taris.
28546 := Goodbye.
28547 := Do you know much about Tatooine?
28548 := I wanted to ask some questions about racing.
28549 := Back to my other questions now.
28550 := What does racing pay?
28551 := Where is the best place to get bike upgrades around here?
28552 := How long have you been racing?
28553 := Are you any good?
28554 := I talked to Motta about you.
28555 := Why don't you want the deal with Motta?
28556 := Maybe I can talk to him about it.
28557 := I think you should sign the contract he offered.
28558 := I'll get back to you. Goodbye.
28559 := You'll sign or get hurt! Understand?
28560 := [Force Persuade] You will sign the contract with Motta.
28561 := It's simple: sign, or you'll die on this rock. Maybe soon. Understand?
28562 := [Force Persuade] You will sign the contract with Motta.
28563 := [Persuade] It's the best deal you'll get. You know it.
28564 := Trust me, a fellow racer. Consider it.
28565 := I convinced Motta to give you a better contract.
28566 := Goodbye then. Good luck.
28567 := When do you think you'll be leaving?
28568 := Sorry, the track is only for racers that Motta has accepted and signed up. He pays for track upkeep, so it's his choice.
28569 := Go talk to him and we'll see about setting you up.
28570 := Well, another swoop-jock come to give the track a try? It's just a 20 credit timing fee for recreational runs.
28571 := All right. Anyone else want to step up?
28572 := Well, Motta pays for timing on official runs, but rec-runs are staffed by volunteers. They deserve a little something.
28573 := Besides, paying for runs keeps usage down. That way we don't crowd the pros off the track.
28574 := Very good. We'll have your bike put in position for the next time trial. Get ready, it won't take long.
28575 := You'll have to go through Motta for that. He keeps track of all official standings at this track.
28576 := There's money in it too. He pays riders for good times to encourage competition.
28577 := Want to take an unofficial run around the track? You've beat everyone, I know, but it's good to keep your skills sharp. 20 credits.
28578 := No thanks. Goodbye.
28579 := Why is there a fee?
28580 := I'll pay for a recreational run.
28581 := I'd like to try an officially timed race.
28582 := I'm surprised to see a new racer. How do you keep your bike running? Parts are scarce around here.
28583 := It's sad... one of our racers was on Taris. Ever race there? Probably not, I'd have heard of you.
28584 := Did I see your bike getting prepped? Not many new ones like that come through here.
28585 := I saw some footage of Taris before the Sith destroyed it... I swear I saw you... couldn't be.
28586 := You are too good for Tatooine, you know that? The best I've ever seen.
28587 := What are you doing here when you can race like that? If the circuit were up, you'd be a star!
28588 := That was some good racing. Best time of the season, I think.
28589 := That was some impressive racing. Good to see you and Zoriis put the boys to shame
28590 := You sure do look good out there on the track, champion. You look pretty good here too.
28591 := I like a man that can move fast when he needs to. Maybe I could trouble you for an autoprint... or something.
28592 := I like having a champion around, but you're probably destined for the circuit, once it's back up and running.
28593 := I have to say, you are looking very impressive to me right now. I hope you stick around.
28594 := You've beaten all the local talents. Only Zoriis is left, and she's a pro. Well, Nico too.
28595 := Yuka Rill won't recover from the loss you handed him anytime soon. That Ithorian's a sore loser.
28596 := It's amazing the way you are shooting up the ranks. I haven't seen racing like that since Nico started getting good.
28597 := I bet Motta's going to start looking at you as a potential champ. Your times just keep getting better.
28598 := So, was your win beginners luck? Most of the amateurs get stuck at about this level.
28599 := Yuka Rill isn't going to like you. He doesn't do well against new competition, and you're up against his time next.
28600 := Too bad about Garm's time being beat, but he's just starting out. You're looking like you've been at this a while.
28601 := You are quite the racer. Too bad there isn't much of a circuit anymore.
28602 := I guess you're not quite up to taking the big prize. It's a shame.
28603 := Your loss wasn't the worst I've seen. I saw Yuka's big crash on Taris two years ago.
28604 := I guess the pressure got to you out there. It's not the first time a racer lost their edge.
28605 := That's really too bad about your last race. You should have won it for sure.
28606 := I Don't know how the riders do it. I get sick at speeds like that.
28607 := Not a lot of women on the swoop circuit. Not that there's much of a circuit left.
28608 := Nico is the big favorite around here. 
28609 := I love watching the races. Nothing much else to do.
28610 := You a racer? Don't sign with Motta. That's all I'm saying.
28611 := It's crass to say, but the destruction of Taris means more racers coming here. Like you, I bet.
28612 := Once you've raced a bit you'll learn that this track isn't the greatest, but it gets the job done.
28613 := We get some decent speed on the desert. No need for expensive mods. It's good for new racers like you.
28614 := I've never seen a woman come into town and take charge like you did out there. You are scary. Wonderfully scary.
28615 := Lady, you are the best. I just had to say that.
28616 := You're beautiful out there, absolutely beautiful. And a pro racer as well!
28617 := That last race was incredible. You just keep looking better and better out there... and here as well.
28618 := I'm going to watch for you in the future. Your races are... just amazing.
28619 := That last race of yours was the most exciting thing to blow through Tatooine... ever.
28620 := If the circuit were up you'd be famous one three... no! Four worlds by now. You're just that good!
28621 := You are an absolute terror on the track! Are you sure you're not a pro already?
28622 := You're almost good enough to go pro, you know? I'll be cheering for you in the next race.
28623 := I'm looking forward to seeing you go against Zoriis Bafka's time. She's been a pro for years.
28624 := Yuka Rill will be crying for days... or whatever it is Ithorians do. You beat his time into the ground!
28625 := Motta wants Tatooine to be the new Taris for races. A few more newcomers with your skills and he might do it.
28626 := If you're such a good racer, why are you here? Maybe you've done as good as you're going to.
28627 := That was a pretty good showing out there. Maybe you're not just another sand-skimming nerf herder.
28628 := Taris was a good track, but their racers were uptight. You win, and you look like you enjoy yourself.
28629 := Watch your bike around here. You're doing all right, and the last thing you want is it to get stripped for parts.
28630 := You didn't look so good out there on that last race. Desert sun getting to you?
28631 := Not the worst I've seen, but you'll have to do better if you want to make the circuit.
28632 := You're losing fans every race you lose. You'd better tighten up out there.
28633 := I suppose I've seen racers do worse than you did, but you'd better show your skills on the next run.
28634 := It's too bad about Taris. The destruction there has really hurt the swoop circuit.
28635 := Got a favorite racer? Nico's good, but Garm's a real pro.
28636 := Every now and then we push a new obstacle on the course to keep it fresh. Good luck out there.
28637 := Gotta like the races. There's nothing else, so you'd better.
28638 := We don't see a lot of new racers. Maybe you'll give Nico a run for his money.
28639 := Motta thinks pros will start coming here now that Taris is gone. I think the Hutt is dreaming.
28640 := Odd to see new racers like you here. This track was never too popular with the pros. Too far out of the way.
28641 := Oh, you're gonna like it here. Crowd is friendly, even if it doesn't really compare to racing for the big circuit.
28642 := I, wrecked my bike in a race a few days ago. Not that I could beat your times anyway.
28643 := Now that you've proven how good you are, stay away from Motta. Just ask around, you'll see why.
28644 := You're a pro, right? You ever race on Taris? Wish I had the chance before it blew.
28645 := You didn't have much competition here. The circuit is hurting after the loss of Taris.
28646 := I was due to race on Taris, but I blew a qualifying race. Guess I'm lucky, huh?
28647 := I'm not good enough to be ranked yet. More trial runs, I guess.
28648 := I'm not racing until my parts come in. Who knows when that will be?
28649 := The track here isn't the greatest, but we have to practice somewhere.
28650 := You again? Why don't you go bother someone else. It's not like I owe you money or something.
28651 := You again? Come to rub my face in your times? You are practically stealing my paycheck every race you run.
28652 := Oh, it's you. You buried my best time on the track. What, are you *trying* to take money out of my pocket?
28653 := You new racers only want two things from old pros: money and advice. My advice? Leave me alone.
28654 := What do you want? You here for money? I'll pay the Hutt what I owe as soon as the circuit is back on its feet.
28655 := No, wait, you don't look like a collector. You're just some kid. Go on, I don't have time for you.
28656 := You don't look like anyone I owe. Stop fooling with me.
28657 := Go on, I've seen your type before. Go push the kids around. They don't put up much of a fight.
28658 := I'm not waiting for you to lose your temper around me. It's not worth it.
28659 := Wait, I don't want a fight. All right, if you want some money, I'll give it to you. I don't need you in my face like this.
28660 := [Success] I know I need to pay you. It's obvious my old loans have caught up to me. I knew it would happen.
28661 := [Failure] What do you take me for, an idiot? I'm not handing money to just anyone.
28662 := [Success] I should have known those loans would catch up to me. Never get your bike fixed in Hutt Space.
28663 := Here, this is everything I have. Now just leave me to figure out how I'm going to pay for track time.
28664 := I can hope, anyway. Just get it over with.
28665 := Why can't you new racers just go learn the track for yourselves? Why would I want to help you beat my times?
28666 := If I say no you'll probably hound me to death. Fine, what do you want?
28667 := Yeah, good riddance.
28668 := I don't know. Go ask some locals. I want to know as little about this dustbowl as possible.
28669 := You've heard all I have. If I had more, I'd use it to win, not tell you.
28670 := There's not much useful you'll get out of me. Yuka Rill is on the way down. I can't match the young riders.
28671 := I suppose. Make it quick.
28672 := Bunch of babies, all of them. Well, except for Zoriis. She's got the goods like I never had. Good for her, I guess.
28673 := But what do you care about this? I heard how you roped Nico into his new deal. He'll be just like me real soon.
28674 := And that Nico is going places, thanks to you. Wish I had someone like you at my back years ago.
28675 := If I have to say something good about the new racers, it would be about that Nico kid. He's got a future.
28676 := He doesn't fear the track. You get old, you start to worry about failing. He just lets it all come to him.
28677 := Some promoter will use him up, and he'll end up in debt like me. It's already happening, I bet.
28678 := Too many years. I've raced on almost every track and all I've got to show for it is an aging bike.
28679 := I've got a few trophies stashed, but they don't pay the bills. Yep, I should have quit after the Coruscant Classic.
28680 := I'd better hope so. It's the last stop for me. If I can't get some decent times going, I may as well not leave.
28681 := I wish I could use the destruction of Taris as an excuse, but I doubt I would have ever made it back there.
28682 := Old guys like me can't make it on the good tracks, and the new racers come here to try and knock us down even further.
28683 := I'm still trying to have one last good run... but it just isn't happening.
28684 := I've got nothing but time now that you've pushed me back to the slow times. Make it quick.
28685 := Wait, no, I recognize you. You're some new racer. Get lost. I don't need more of you on my tail.
28686 := Wait, I know you. You slaughtered my second tier time out on the track. It's like you're trying to steal from me.
28687 := I've got enough trouble without dealing with you. Leave me alone.
28688 := Maybe you were right. Maybe I want money.
28689 := Never mind. I didn't mean anything by it.
28690 := Show some respect! I could kill you where you stand!
28691 := [Force Persuade] You know you need to pay me.
28692 := [Persuade/Lie] There's a bounty on you, and I mean to collect it.
28693 := Just answer my questions and I'll leave you alone.
28694 := I've a few things I wanted to ask. Spare a moment?
28695 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
28696 := I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?
28697 := I want to ask about you and racing.
28698 := Let's go back to my first questions.
28699 := What can you tell me about the other racers?
28700 := What makes you say that?
28701 := What do you think about that?
28702 := How long have you been at this?
28703 := No good memories? That seems a waste.
28704 := Is this the best place for racing?
28705 := Why have racers come here?
28706 := I have nothing more to say to you. There is no point in continuing this.
28707 := Hello again. Have you had a chance to look more closely at our sport?
28708 := The track is yours today, I see. Well done beating my time. The sport needs people that give the crowd a spectacle.
28709 := You have certainly shown your skill on the track. I imagine you'll be taking aim at my times next.
28710 := Well, I am impressed with your efforts on the track. You show the promise of a gifted beginner.
28711 := Yes? Is there something you wish? I have a moment or two while others post their times.
28712 := Is this a racing matter? Perhaps you are interested in taking up the sport?
28713 := All right. Merely making conversation. I'm not looking for a fight.
28714 := The humor of this is lost on me. The mood on this planet is harsh enough without your games.
28715 := Now, if we are through, I must get back to my race preparations. I prefer to leave your unpleasantness behind.
28716 := Wait! Look, if I've offended some local custom or something, I apologize. I don't want a fight. Here, take this.
28717 := Is that all? Then take what I have. Yes, I'm just giving it to you. I can afford to turn this mugging into simple beggary.
28718 := All right, I will be as brief as possible. Ask away.
28719 := I always have time for a fellow swoop racer. Go ahead.
28720 := I'm not so preoccupied with the track that I can't spare a few minutes. Go ahead.
28721 := Racer's luck be with you.
28722 := I must confess that I haven't had much time to learn about this planet. Talk of Taris has seemed more important.
28723 := Some of the hunters in Fazza's lodge seem like they would know more than I would, but that wouldn't take much. 
28724 := I am not used to such attention. What do you want me to repeat?
28725 := My name is Zoriis Bafka. I suppose I am one of the more experienced racers here. What do you want me to answer?
28726 := If you wish. I don't mind answering.
28727 := There are some promising newcomers here. Garm tries hard and I wish him well, but Nico is the one to watch.
28728 := But you know about him. He will be a champion, but with his deal he won't see many of the benefits of it.
28729 := Are you denying your role in his choice? I think it was fairly explicit that you pushed him into the deal.
28730 := But, I suppose it was his choice, even with your... vigorous encouragement.
28731 := But you already know about him. The favor you have done for him will help him greatly in years to come.
28732 := It's invigorating to watch him discover his skills. I hope he manages to remember why he took up the sport.
28733 := The race is not just about speed. It is a business, and we are the product. He must market himself carefully. 
28734 := It is a necessary side to the sport. We must make someone money, or there would be no circuit.
28735 := A few years, but I raced under a different name when I was young. My early career was not very spectacular.
28736 := It wasn't that big of a deal. I made the jump from one league to another and wanted to shed some baggage.
28737 := Don't waste much thought on it. It was purely a personal matter that has no bearing today.
28738 := Perhaps not, but it will do for now. Professional racers like myself travel wherever the purses are highest.
28739 := It's no secret that one of the most popular tracks was lost with Taris. Other promoters will need time to organize.
28740 := In the meantime, we will race at the smaller venues. This is almost a recreational stop for me.
28741 := You lose the skills if you don't use them. I could race on any open road, but competition gives the push to get better.
28742 := Besides, if my presence lends a little prestige to the track, maybe we'll get some new racers out of it.
28743 := I'm sure you will be racing again soon yourself. You have shown that you have the necessary skills.
28744 := Your petty hobbies are of no interest to me.
28745 := Of course not. I meant no harm.
28746 := I think you've found one anyway!
28747 := I don't want a fight either. I just want money.
28748 := I just have some questions. Don't bother getting friendly.
28749 := I wanted to ask a few questions, if you have the time.
28750 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
28751 := I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?
28752 := I want to ask about you and racing.
28753 := Let's go back to my first questions.
28754 := What can you tell me about the other racers?
28755 := He should have been smarter.
28756 := What makes you say that?
28757 := What do you think about that?
28758 := How long have you been at this?
28759 := Why did you change your racing name?
28760 := Is this the best place for racing?
28761 := If this track is so small, why bother?
28762 := Motta the Hutt
28763 := Garm

28779 := tat17ae_swoop_return
28780 := Tatooine - Cantina
28781 := Yes, I'm sorry, do I know you?
28782 := I am here, Mother. Or don't you recognize me?
28783 := What do you expect, when I haven't so much as had a picture of you since you left? Do you know how long I've been trying to find you?
28784 := You knew as well as I communication would be impossible once I joined the order. Now what is this about? Where is Father?
28785 := Then you haven't heard. I should have known.
28786 := Has something happened to him? Are you going to tell me or not?
28787 := Your Father is dead, Bastila. That is part of the reason why I was looking for you.
28788 := Dead? What happened? What did you do to him?!
28789 := Isn't this a lovely reunion? Already she is flinging insults at me. Tell me... you're one of her friends. Do you treat your mother this way?
28790 := I see Bastila seeks out friends that are as selfish as she is. This is how you treat a dying woman?
28791 := I'm sure Bastila feels the same way you do. She would prefer to be left out of it, at least until I'm as dead as her father is.
28792 := Is that so? Well, I'll be joining her soon enough, I suppose.
28793 := I was told you were sick. Are you actually dying, or is this merely melodrama for my benefit?
28794 := Such sweet things you say. *sigh* Perhaps I should tell you everything, first, before we start arguing again.
28795 := You could start by telling me what you got Father into that killed him.
28796 := I hadn't realized Jedi were so spiteful. You want me to tell you I brought your father here for an expedition, do you? You want to blame me for his death?
28797 := You never accepted that your father loved going on his treasure hunts, leaving you alone with me. I was always to blame for everything, what else is new?
28798 := So yes, fine. I brought your father here to look for krayt dragon pearls. He took an expedition into the Tatooine desert and he died.
28799 := How can you be sure of that? Father is an experienced --
28800 := Do you think I would look for you if I wasn't sure? They were attacked by a krayt dragon and one of the guides fled the battle. He saw your father killed.
28801 := I... see. So what do you want from me? Credits?
28802 := Don't be insulting. I want you to use those senses of yours. I want you to find him. I want you to bring back his holocron.
28803 := Why? So you can sell it?
28804 := Is it too much to ask that I have something to remember your father by? Of course it is, isn't it? You couldn't be bothered.
28805 := We're very busy on a mission from the Jedi Council. I doubt I'll have the time. Ask my companions if you doubt me.
28806 := It doesn't seem to have anything to do with what she's asking. Are you actually sick, Mother?
28807 := What difference does it make to you? None, I'm sure. Just find your father's holocron and you won't have to worry about me again either way.
28808 := That's the kind of response I would expect. Very well. We'll look for the holocron if we have time. I can't promise any more than that.
28809 := I believe your father was headed north towards the Sand People enclave. I would check along that route, dear. Do please hurry.
28810 := What remains would there be? Krayt dragons are huge predators, easily able to devour a human, and the desert is a harsh environment.
28811 := Finding my father's remains would be an even more impossible task than finding his holocron. An ignoble end to a fine man.
28812 := As my daughter is quick to point out, I haven't the coin to hire another expedition. Nor am I the adventurer my husband was.
28813 := Yes? I'm sorry, do I know you?
28814 := Good. I thought you were perhaps one of those collectors from the Exchange. Since you're not, I doubt we have any business. Good day. 
28815 := I'm sure there are plenty of other strangers about for you to harass with questions. Why don't you select one of them?
28816 := Thank you. I would rather be alone.
28817 := You know my daughter? Where is she?
28818 := Is that so? Has she said this, herself? Tell her it is quite urgent that I speak with her at once. She has been most difficult to find.
28819 := See that you do. If Bastila is here, I can't see why she didn't come herself.
28820 := I don't see why Bastila should be telling anything to a stranger about family business. Simply tell her to come and that should be enough.
28821 := I most certainly will not. What I have to say is for Bastila alone. It is... family business. That should be enough for her to come.
28822 := Back already? Have you even looked for the holocron, yet?
28823 := I don't have the holocron, if that's what you're asking.
28824 := Then what are you waiting for? Go, find it!
28825 := I have the holocron, Mother. I'm just not sure I want to give it to you.
28826 := And why not? Would you deny me even that?
28827 := I've never denied you anything, Mother. You may think I don't remember what it was like before I left for the order, but I do.
28828 := You were the one who pushed Father to go on one treasure hunt after the other. You loved living in wealth. You think I don't remember the fights?
28829 := You were eager to send me to the Jedi, even though I didn't want to go. You took Father away from me, and now this holocron is all I have of him.
28830 := Fool girl! You have a strange way of remembering things. That wasn't --
28831 := No. I don't wish to argue with you any more, Mother. It's time we parted ways, now, for both our benefit.
28832 := So that's the way it is, is it? All that Jedi training and you haven't learned a thing.
28833 := On the contrary, I've learned much. I've learned, for instance, when it is best to walk away from a situation that can lead only to conflict.
28834 := How can you learn anything when you hear only what you want to hear? Well, go on, then. Keep the holocron. It was for you, anyhow.
28835 := I'll just go off and die peacefully and you needn't bother with me anymore. That's obviously what's best.
28836 := Farewell, Mother. May the Force be with you.
28837 := Hmph. It may as well be with one of us.
28838 := I... perhaps not. I can remember my father well enough. But I ask you: why should she have it?
28839 := You don't know her. My mother is notoriously deceptive when she wants something. Why should she have the holocron?
28840 := Is it too difficult to believe that I am a dying woman who simply wishes to see her husband one last time?
28841 := I find it difficult to believe anything you say, Mother.
28842 := *Sigh* You're right. It shames me, but I just... I find it difficult to... let go of the past. I'm... sorry, Mother.
28843 := I was hard on you, dear. I wasn't a very good mother to you, I know that.
28844 := Your father loved you so. He wanted you to be just like him... he wanted to take you on his hunts, but I said they were too dangerous.
28845 := I always tried to keep him from the dangerous ones, but he would have none of it. It was a reckless life we led, always moving... I didn't want that for you.
28846 := So that's why you gave me to the Order?
28847 := What do your father and I have to show for all those years of hunting? Nothing. That was no life for anyone, especially not someone as gifted as you.
28848 := Your father... he spent all his last years trying to pay for my treatments. That's why he went for the pearls. I begged him not to, but...
28849 := Your treatments.
28850 := I'm dying, Bastila. I did not lie about that. It's been a long time in the coming, and there's really nothing that can be done anymore.
28851 := I told your father to let me go, but you know how he was. Stubborn. Like you.
28852 := I'm so sorry, Mother. I don't know what to say...
28853 := Keep the holocron, Bastila. It would do me good to know you have it. This... talking to you... this is what I really needed before I...
28854 := I know, Mother. Thank you. I'm glad we talked, too.
28855 := Well, now. You said you had important business, and you were never one to mince words. You there... you take care of my daughter, you hear me?
28856 := So you're not. I'd feel better knowing that someone was there to watch over her, however. I wasn't.
28857 := You make her let you. She's too much like her father in that respect.
28858 := So could her father. That doesn't mean she doesn't need help now and again.
28859 := That's good. I'll feel a lot better knowing there's someone to watch her.
28860 := Where are you going to go?
28861 := *sigh* Alright, I will. Now you do what you have to, Bastila. You go make your father and I proud.
28862 := I'll try. Farewell, Mother.
28863 := You're back, I see. And Bastila isn't even with you.
28864 := I suppose she's too busy to even help her own mother, correct? Nothing more than I would expect from her after all this time.
28865 := Go on, leave me be. I will find the holocron myself, if I have to.
28866 := Only if she deserved it.
28867 := Hey, leave me out of this.
28868 := My mother is long dead, if you must know.
28869 := What about your mother's sickness?
28870 := Don't you want to find your father's remains, Bastila?
28871 := Why don't you get the holocron yourself, Miss... er... Helena?
28872 := No, I don't think so.
28873 := Could I ask you some questions?
28874 := I have to go.
28875 := Are you Bastila's mother?
28876 := Nearby. I'm not sure she wants to meet with you.
28877 := I'll tell her when I see her.
28878 := She said that you two don't get along.
28879 := Tell me what you want and I'll relay it to her.
28880 := You're right. Let's go.
28881 := Do you really need the holocron, Bastila?
28882 := Maybe you should listen to what she has to say.
28883 := I agree. We should go before this gets ugly.
28884 := Maybe one of you should be the first to give the other a break?
28885 := It sounds like you've already made up your mind.
28886 := Hmph. I'm not her keeper.
28887 := As if she'd let me!
28888 := Bastila can take care of herself.
28889 := I'll do my best.
28890 := Hello again. Could I tempt you into a game? There's very little else to do that won't potentially leave you dead.
28891 := Hello again. Would you like to have another round of Pazaak? I'd like to try and win back my money.
28892 := I mean, I don't want to say that it was beginner's luck, but you should play again to truly get a feel for the game.
28893 := It's only fair, after all. You have won against me twice, but I still think I can teach you a thing or two.
28894 := Ah, it's you again. Truly, you are a fine opponent. I'd be honored to play you again.
28895 := However, you'll understand if we don't have any wagers. I... respect your ability too much to insult you by betting on you losing.
28896 := Stop by anytime. I'd like to visit my money.
28897 := Something else? I don't think I know about much else. Pazaak is all that I do, right now. I'm sorry.
28898 := Ask around, I'm sure there are many better sources of information than me.
28899 := Very good. Just for the sport of it. That's all I can afford.
28900 := Ahh, you are back. I hope I didn't scare you off with that loss. Hard blow, but that's the nature of the cards.
28901 := I don't want to sour you on the game. Perhaps another small wager game?
28902 := I don't want to say that your single win was a fluke. Perhaps you would like to play again?
28903 := Ah, you did have two promising wins. Would you care to try and take your money back?
28904 := Well, a fresh face for the game. I wonder, would you care to play? My name is Furko Nellis. My vice is Pazaak.
28905 := All right, but remember that there isn't much fun on Tatooine that isn't life threatening. Come back if you'd like a game.
28906 := Ah, I'm sure you do, but I won't have answers. I leave other people to their business, and they leave me to mine.
28907 := Really, you'll have to seek information elsewhere, but if you want some recreation, I've cards ready to play.
28908 := Must I? An opinion would draw attention to myself. The Sith have shown what happens to things that draw their attention.
28909 := Ha ha! Very good! Would you... care to wager on a game?
28910 := Of course, it is always good to keep them fresh in your mind. I'd be glad to go over the delicacies of the game with you.
28911 := But, I think you would benefit more from having a copy of your own to study when you wish. Here is a handy page you can slot right into your personal journal. There you go.
28912 := No? That's unfortunate. I happen to have one that I could sell you, but it's a little basic. Certainly not tournament worthy.
28913 := Here, how about you give me... 100 credits. A fine deal. Not many stores sell... equipment of this nature.
28914 := [Success] You know what... I don't want to charge you for it. I want new players to take up the game.
28915 := [Failure] I'm afraid I really can't do that. The cards have their value. I can't change it.
28916 := [Success] Hmm... perhaps you are right. I want new people to get a good start on the game. I need opponents.
28917 := Besides, it is a very basic deck. All right, it's yours. Now, care to have a game or two?
28918 := Very good, I'll just take that, and here you are. Now you should practice. Care to play?
28919 := Well, since you have never beaten me, we'll make this for a paltry 50 credits. No bargaining now. This is serious.
28920 := To be fair, I'll use my practice deck as well. I don't want to scare you off, you understand.
28921 := That is unfortunate. Please, feel free to return when you can. I'm sorry, but I prefer the thrill of the payoff.
28922 := Ha ha! Very good. Now, don't worry if I beat you too harshly. It is a learning experience.
28923 := Hmm... you have some rudimentary skills. I think I'll use my second best deck this time and up the stakes. 
28924 := 200 credits will be the wager. I trust you will have the money on hand?
28925 := You won't be so eager in a moment. I promise you.
28926 := Well... you have proven quite the opponent, but I think the time has come to end this. You will not win again.
28927 := I usually only use this deck at tournaments, but I think you're worthy of it. Shall we say... 500 credits on the outcome?
28928 := Yes... well then, 500 credits on the line. Heh... here we go.
28929 := Right. Goodbye.
28930 := I want to ask you about something else.
28931 := All right, let's have a game.
28932 := I'll be going now.
28933 := I want to ask you some questions.
28934 := You must have an opinion about what happened on Taris.
28935 := Okay, let's talk Pazaak.
28936 := Brief me on the rules.
28937 := I don't have a Pazaak deck.
28938 := I can't pay that right now. Maybe later.
28939 := [Force Persuade] You don't want to charge me for it.
28940 := [Persuade] Come now, you'll make your credits back by playing me.
28941 := 100 credits will be fine.
28942 := I'll play. What is the wager?
28943 := I've changed my mind.
28944 := I can't pay that.
28945 := Let's go.
28946 := **Player loses first game. This choice just sets a local**
28947 := **Player wins first game. This choice just sets a local**
28948 := You're on. Let's have at it!
28949 := **Player loses second game. This choice just sets a local**
28950 := **Player wins second game. This choice just sets a local**
28951 := Bring it on.
28952 := **Player loses third game. This choice just sets a local**
28953 := **Player wins third game. This choice just sets a local**
28954 := Well, imagine you coming back. Heh heh. Something you want?
28955 := I heard about you setting a track record. Wish I'd seen it. Ah, it would've just made me want to be out there myself.
28956 := Hello again. I hear you're pretty fast out on the track. Remember these days. Yes sir. Once they're gone, whoo, they're gone.
28957 := I hear you're pretty good on the track. Yeah. I remember my first paycheck for racing. Heh heh. So small you couldn't see it, but I remember.
28958 := Well now, what can Gandroff do for you? It's been a while since I've had anyone bother talking to me.
28959 := Usually it's some kid wondering what my old racing days were like... but that was back on Taris. Seems like a long time ago.
28960 := No need to get all confrontational. What are... what are we, Sand People? You wouldn't find much fight left in me, anyway. 
28961 := Doesn't seem like it. I've seen your kind before. Does it make you feel big, pushing old men around? You're all the same. Heh.
28962 := Now, leave me to my drinking. I don't think we'd have much to talk about. Not if I can help it.
28963 := Why bother? I mean, will this pay for ship maintenance or whatever? You're just looking for coward credits.
28964 := Bah, if it will get you to leave, just take what credits I have. Take em. Take em. Now leave me. I don't want anything to do with you.
28965 := Then race for it! By the Force, what do you think an old man like me would have? Bah, take it all.
28966 := Uh, well, I wouldn't worry about that, not with your attitude. Go on then, ask away. I'm ready.
28967 := Sure, not a problem. Might as well try to pass along some of what I know. Heh heh. My racing days are pretty much done.
28968 := I'm not sure what I have that you would be interested in. I... I'm... I'm just an old swoop-jock that doesn't have the head for it anymore. Heh.
28969 := Uh, keep safe. Yup. Yup. Seems like tough times are coming.
28970 := Ask me again in a few years and it will be me. Heh heh. I'm probably not going back out on the circuit... if there is one.
28971 := But, for now, I don't know any more than the next guy. You should try the locals. Jawas maybe. Funny little guys. Li'l jawa, li'l jawa.
28972 := Ahh, something I know. Well... well, something I used to know. Um, my racing days are behind me. Gandroff is the name.
28973 := All right then. 
28974 := I don't really talk to any of them. I know Zoriis from the circuit and you couldn't ask for a tougher lady. Smart too.
28975 := I don't know the younger guys, but after you pushed that deal on Nico, I doubt they'd trust me or anyone. 
28976 := I don't know the younger guys, but I suppose they're in good hands. What you did for Nico was good to see.
28977 := I don't know the younger guys, but... but I've been watching Nico. Uh, good to see someone doing it for the love of the race.
28978 := I don't know, but some people just have something that lets the bike take them. It's like the air stops pushing back.
28979 := That's an old track tale, you know; when the wind decides to stop fighting? I used to have that. Heh... not any more.
28980 := I think you know what I mean; when the wind decides to stop fighting? Hmm. You've felt it. I can tell by your times.
28981 := Oh, well past my prime, by any measure. I started late, too. Not like the kids out there now. Some of them are too young. Hm.
28982 := It's a cutthroat business. I... I've seen some of them burn out after a year. They get dangerous, and don't live long.
28983 := That's not everyone, of course, but... but it happens. I'm a has-been, I'll admit, but... but dying while you're on top is still dying. I'll pass.
28984 := Best place to race is wherever the track treats you sweet and your times are golden. It's that simple.
28985 := You get hung up on any one track and... and you'll end up like me. Heh heh. My favorite stop was Taris... Taris, yes... always looked forward to going back.
28986 := Now I don't want to touch my bike at all. Maybe I wasn't in the winner's circle lately, but I still raced for sport, you know? Vroom vroom.
28987 := A woman. I never won on Taris, but it was always my first stop on the circuit, and the last if I could help it. Heh.
28988 := That doesn't matter now. You can't ask for more certain closure than the whole planet being gone. Poof. Boom. Heh. Gone.
28989 := Oh, I... I don't want to get into that, miss. Let's just say that there was always someone trackside rooting for me. Heh heh.
28990 := I... I am not used to such attention. Uh, what do you want me to repeat?
28991 := I saw you down by the track, didn't I? Or was that someone else? I've been distracted by what happened on Taris.
28992 := Go on, take a walk. My mood is sour enough without you here.
28993 := I don't care about your faded glory. I'm not here for storytime.
28994 := I meant no harm. I apologize.
28995 := Then just die, old man. I'm not backing down.
28996 := I don't want a fight. I just want money.
28997 := I just have some questions. Don't bother getting friendly.
28998 := I wanted to ask a few questions, if you have the time.
28999 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
29000 := I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?
29001 := I want to ask about you and racing.
29002 := Let's go back to my first questions.
29003 := Your answers are tiresome. Have you anything of use to say?
29004 := What can you tell me about the other racers?
29005 := What makes him any different than the others?
29006 := How long did you race?
29007 := Why do you think that?
29008 := Is this the best place for racing?
29009 := What made Taris any different than here?
29010 := Leave me, human. If you're here to stir things up, I want no part of it.
29011 := Don't care if we've got Sith rule or Republic rule. Either way I work the mines.
29012 := Sith... Jedi... do either of them really care when normal people get caught in their fighting?
29013 := Good thing there's nothing on Tatooine to get the attention of the Sith. Right?
29014 := Jawas... can't stand them. They never bathe, you know.
29015 := Trapped out here... can't do anything. I wonder which planet is next?
29016 := Scurry away. I had family on Taris and I'm not in a mood to talk.
29017 := Don't go bothering people while they are drinking. It's rude.
29018 := Back, but nothing changes, and ours are still lost. Iziz starts to know you will not help, and fades his hopes.
29019 := Why would you bother we of Jawa under Iziz? Yours do not care for ours. Do you miss we that are taken? No.
29020 := Your kind are like that, and Iziz is foolish to think that you are not. We know this. Leave us to the trouble.
29021 := Iziz stands at the walls that hold out the sand. They listen poorly there too. Your kind hide behind bad ears.
29022 := Is this interest? Not from your kind, though Iziz thinks otherwise. Speak to him if you are acting and pretending.
29023 := Jawas are tired of giant-speak. Might as well slave to the gaffi. So you trade, but what is that if no help is given?
29024 := Query: Is the miniature organic implying falsehood? Shall I blast it, master?
29025 := Hmm. These Jawas sure aren't the trusting type, are they?
29026 := No doubt with good reason.
29027 := Well, for once, I'll agree with you.
29028 := The voices of Jawa under Iziz are not flawed. The ears of your kin are poor while we speak plain of our missing.
29029 := Seems fairly clear to me, though he doesn't seem used to people actually stopping to listen.
29030 := He sounds... not right. Unnatural.
29031 := It's not that hard to understand if you listen. It's just... odd.
29032 := Hence the 'unclear' part. Or did you miss that?
29033 := Your sarcasm is not appreciated, Carth.
29034 := Translation: Doubtful. The Jawa language is structured in an odd manner. You are lucky to understand what you do.
29035 := Strange. You are of your kind, but are unlike them too. You helped where others did not. Iziz was right in this.
29036 := You have the thanks of the Jawa under Iziz. We will remember when you are the ones that have gone.
29037 := But taking of more was there as well. You have made the unfair trade. We will remember, both good and not.
29038 := Jawa babble. I don't have time for this.
29039 := Iziz... is that your leader? Where is he?
29040 := "We that are taken?" Are some of your people missing?
29041 := You two agreed? Somebody mark this day down.
29042 := Please, could you try to speak more clearly?
29043 := "Of your missing?" Have some of your people gone missing?
29044 := You again? What is it now?
29045 := Did I see you down by the swoop track? I'll remind you that I don't give loans and I expect prompt payment on bar bills.
29046 := Drink up, friend. I hear the Sith are restless on Korriban, and they never keep their problems to themselves.
29047 := Looks like people will have to drink to forget their pain, now that kolto is so expensive. Of course, no one from Manaan is saying a word about it.
29048 := I had a few Czerka employees confide that the company is pulling out of Kashyyyk. Leaving as soon as things get difficult... just like they'll do here.
29049 := Hmm, what's the winner of the Manaan Sector Champion title doing here, I wonder? Must have blown all your winnings.
29050 := Eh? Who are you, then? The only new people that come to Junix Nard's cantina are longtime losers and bounty hunters.
29051 := I don't have to tell you why the two don't mix well. Please keep any blaster fire to a minimum.
29052 := Yeah, yeah. 
29053 := I suppose you are fishing for a reaction to the destruction of Taris? That's all anyone from off-world is talking about.
29054 := Well, I'll tell you, it's about time someone kicked the Republic in the tail and got things moving. I guess the Sith are the ones to do it.
29055 := Don't get me wrong, all those deaths were horrible, but war gets the money moving. Maybe they'll decide to fortify us out here.
29056 := No.
29057 := Just "no". I don't look for trouble. You'll have to talk to people yourself if you want more than that. Now, if you don't mind.
29058 := What, did some Czerka promoter tell you to come to this planet? I pity you if you were expecting a prosperous mining outpost.
29059 := Nothing here but sand and more sand. There's a little hunting and racing, but nothing that will make a small man rich.
29060 := It would cut into my business if people thought I'd turn them in. I don't know anything about anyone, thank you very much.
29061 := Now, if this is about Sand People, that's a different matter. I have no problem talking about them.
29062 := I know they don't negotiate. Attacks are worst in the far south of the Dune Sea, right where the sandcrawlers have to pass. 
29063 := You wipe them out, you'll make a lot of friends.
29064 := You made short work of the Sand People, and I thank you for that, but don't make trouble for me here.
29065 := I don't deal with any of that. Motta the Hutt has a lock on everrything race related on Tatooine. You deal with him or you don't race.
29066 := What, you couldn't take some notes when you signed up with Motta? I heard you were down at the track; there's nothing new I can tell you.
29067 := Well, there's two kinds of hunting on Tatooine: hunting wraid, and hunting people. Both are dangerous and both have certain restrictions.
29068 := You'll need a Czerka hunting license, even though most hunters deal with Fazza at the lodge once they have their paperwork squared away.
29069 := All right then. Just keep it brief, will you? I've got customers.
29070 := They maintain an office west of here in central Anchorhead. That's about all they maintain these days.
29071 := Fazza's is northwest of here, north of the Czerka office. He'll steer you towards the Czerka for a license before dealing with you.
29072 := After that, he'll buy the trophies you collect. I don't know what he does with it all, but I guess he makes a living somehow.
29073 := You've got a license there, don't you? Fazza's lodge will be open to you now. Nothing more I can tell you about hunting that his lot won't.
29074 := And since you got that license from Czerka, you know they look for bounties of their own. They are the ones with credits to pay and interests to protect.
29075 := I've already gone over this stuff with you. Couldn't you go ask someone else? I'm not one of those "listening" bartenders.
29076 := Czerka Corporation only worries about keeping their own stores full. I don't have much on hand.
29077 := I have to go. Goodbye.
29078 := Anything out of the ordinary happening?
29079 := Know about anything more local?
29080 := "No" you don't know, or "no" you won't tell me?
29081 := I want to ask about things here on Tatooine.
29082 := I want to ask if you know about a bounty I am currently hunting.
29083 := What do you know about the Sand People?
29084 := Tell me about racing.
29085 := I've got some questions about hunting.
29086 := Let's go back to my first questions.
29087 := Where does Czerka Corporation give out the licenses?
29088 := Where is Fazza's lodge?
29089 := Do you have anything for sale?
29090 := Well, imagine you coming back. Something you want?
29091 := Something you want, spacer? Go talk to the office if you want to complain about conditions here. I don't want to hear it.
29092 := Seems like every other person I meet is complaining about something. Well, it's not going to get better, so leave me alone.
29093 := Oh well, I wouldn't want that, now would I? Just leave me alone.
29094 := Just hot air blowing, eh? Well take it somewhere else. I don't have the patience right now. Not with my workload.
29095 := Go on, leave me alone. I don't want to have anything more to do with you.
29096 := What are you doing, coming in here like you're Sand People or something? That's no way to do business. I don't need this.
29097 := Here, take some cred's, if that's what you want. Go drown in a drink, like every other failure in here.
29098 := What, are you a beggar? Fine, if it will get you to leave, take a few cred's, but don't expect another handout.
29099 := Trouble? Why would I want to make trouble with you? This planet has more than enough as it is.
29100 := I don't really have any interest in helping you. Will this be quick?
29101 := Good. I've a lack of business to attend to.
29102 := Nobody we've brought, that's for sure. Our experts said this rock was supposed to have mining potential to last for years.
29103 := Nothing but garbage ore, good for nothing. You ever try to sell someone garbage? My name is mud in three systems now.
29104 := Well, you don't look like much of a customer, and neither does anyone else here. I sell to companies, not people loitering in bars.
29105 := Bah, you wouldn't understand. You're like everyone else, complaining about how Czerka isn't feeding and clothing you like it should.
29106 := Well, I'm mad too. There's not much of a retirement plan I can count on if the whole outpost goes belly up. I'll be just like you.
29107 := All right then. Make it quick.
29108 := He has no pride at all. Might as well be dead.
29109 := You're pet is growling. Maybe he needs to be brushed. Look, you're just like everyone else, angry about not getting enough work.
29110 := Like I said before, I don't much care what you think. I'll be on the street if business keeps dropping, and it will.
29111 := You swoop racers, do you even know what it takes to run an outpost like this? As long as there's flat ground, what do you care?
29112 := Get lost, spacer. I've had enough of you.
29113 := I'm getting sick of your attitude.
29114 := I meant no harm. I apologize.
29115 := Why should I? You going to do something? I could kill you.
29116 := I will, for a price.
29117 := I just have some questions. Don't give me any trouble.
29118 := I wanted to ask a few questions, if you have the time.
29119 := I have to leave. Goodbye.
29120 := I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?
29121 := You're not much of a spokesman for Czerka Corporation.
29122 := Let's go back to my first questions.
29123 := Have you anything useful to say? I'm getting tired of you.
29124 := I've enough to worry about with my mining quotas, I don't have time for you.
29125 := Czerka Corporation should just close this whole place down. Heh. Who would miss it?
29126 := The sooner I get out of this dustbowl, the better.
29127 := Maybe the Sith will give us more support here on Tatooine. Couldn't get worse.
29128 := How are the Sand People doing so much damage? Blasters beat gaffi sticks, don't they?
29129 := Should have been a wraid hunter. I hate this uniform.
29130 := Go to the Czerka offices if you want a job. I'm off duty.
29131 := Our business has nothing to do with you, spacer.
29132 := [Unintelligible]
29133 := Move to the sides, out of serving way.
29134 := Jawas will dig the sand for you one day.
29135 := Better here than with People of Sand.
29136 := You were not here first, yet Jawas serve.
29137 := This job is not fair trade.

29156 := Tatooine - Czerka Office
29157 := Greetings again from the offices of Czerka Corporation. Is this about bounties or something else?
29158 := Hello again. I hear you've made an impression down at the swoop track. Czerka Corporation wholly supports local events.
29159 := Er... not financially, you understand. Now, was this about bounties or something else?
29160 := Can I help you? These are the offices of Czerka Corporation. I trust you have business with the company?
29161 := If this is about employment, I'm afraid all regular mining positions are full. And before you ask, we are also no longer selling hunting licenses.
29162 := Farewell. Czerka Corporation welcomes your future inquiries.
29163 := I assume that by "out of the ordinary" you are referring to the destruction of Taris? That is all anyone is talking about.
29164 := I'm afraid Czerka Corporation is not offering any comment on those events. We wouldn't wish to anger the participants.
29165 := Czerka Corporation policy is not subject to your approval. It is a sound business model. Save us your commentary.
29166 := If you are looking for local events, I suggest you go to the swoop track. One of the few leisure industries on Tatooine.
29167 := Hmm... there was also a Jawa here earlier, saying something about needing help. I think he's out by the city gates.
29168 := I can't be more specific about what he wanted. Our droid translators had difficulty with the message.
29169 := Of course. Czerka Corporation records are available at our Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours please.
29170 := For your needs here, we maintain a fully stocked storehouse. Speak with Greeta Holda about any purchases.
29171 := Certainly. Please pose your questions to the Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours please.
29172 := [Success] Of course, I could just tell you now. No sense in being so secretive. It's all fairly obvious.
29173 := [Failure] I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I'll have to refer you to the Representative Kiosk.
29174 := [Success] I suppose you're right. It's not like you can't tell the state of things just by looking around.
29175 := Mining operations here have not been a success. The ore is substandard, and there's less of it than surveys indicated.
29176 := With the Sand People raids on top of it all, it's no wonder this planet has been abandoned before.
29177 := We can't ignore evidence that Anchorhead was settled more than once before, and abandoned each time.
29178 := There's probably about a century between each attempt. Just long enough for records about why it failed to disappear.
29179 := The Jawas scavenge ancient tech all the time. It's a remote world. Who knows what's here?
29180 := The company would have to be foolish to stay. It will be costly, but in the end, leaving will be cheaper than staying.
29181 := I imagine all the heavy equipment will be abandoned. It's not worth shipping out things like sandcrawlers.
29182 := Maybe the Jawas will find a use for them when we're gone. Ha! That's a laugh!
29183 := No one knows. There are odd energy fluctuations on this planet, but they defy analysis or explanation.
29184 := But the effect is obvious. Ore taken from Tatooine is useless for construction. It degrades incredibly fast.
29185 := Word is getting out about it too. We're running out of buyers. Czerka Corporation is not doing well here.
29186 := I'm sorry, but day-to-day operations of Czerka Corporation outposts are fully regionalized. I have no information on Kashyyyk.
29187 := I'm sorry, I'll have to direct you to our Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours only, please.
29188 := Yes, we are still waiting for you to return with the Sand People Chieftain's gaffi stick. I will reward you well when you do.
29189 := We don't have any new information on the subject. It is still possible that they have an enclave in the far south of the Dune Sea.
29190 := And I would remind you that you did agree to do this task for Czerka Corporation. We expect completion in a timely manner.
29191 := I should remind you that you were not retained as a diplomatic representative. You are a hunter, and should go after your prey as we agreed.
29192 := You are not authorized to do anything other than deliver what was promised. Do so, and don't talk of this foolishness again.
29193 := You have fulfilled your end of the bargain and Czerka Corporation is grateful. The Sand People will be less of a threat without their chieftain.
29194 := I will of course continue to give you bounties on regular gaffi sticks. Every one helps.
29195 := As I said, we are no longer selling them. There are too many people cavorting about outside the walls as it is.
29196 := Very well, though I do have work to get back to.
29197 := With the downturn in mining, people want any chance at credits they can get. Most wouldn't survive a day, let alone qualify as hunters.
29198 := The last license issued before the ban was given to a woman named Marlena Venn. She'll do fine; she had a mean streak a parsec wide.
29199 := She also paid double. Exceptions like this are rare, unless it suits the company to offer them.
29200 := Well, normally we charge 200 credits, but I could make an exception if you agreed to perform a task for us. It's similar to hunting.
29201 := The Sand People are becoming a problem. They destroy our sandcrawlers and kill our miners. One particular tribe is the worst.
29202 := It's as if their chieftain has decided to wage a war against us. I would like their attacks... terminated. Bring me their gaffi sticks as proof.
29203 := If you agree to do this, I'll give you a hunting license now and pay a bounty for each stick later. I'll give a bonus for the chieftain's.
29204 := Excellent. Now, just so we understand each other, this is an enforceable contract. Czerka Corporation takes this very seriously.
29205 := Here is your license, and a few directions. We believe one of their enclaves is in the far south of the Dune Sea.
29206 := You might try following one of our sandcawlers. They are regularly attacked. I wouldn't mind you escorting them.
29207 := Very good. Czerka Corporation looks forward to your future business.
29208 := Then you are free to not leave the city, just like everyone else. Czerka Corporation will welcome your eventual change of mind.
29209 := Please, feel free to enjoy the door behind you.
29210 := Which would you rather have dumped on your office floor? Besides, they are ceremonial weapons unique to each warrior. It's just as good.
29211 := We use them to insure that only people judged fit by Czerka Corporation are allowed outside the city.
29212 := We don't allow casual exploration because of legal concerns. Czerka Corporation takes no responsibility for loss of life on the dunes.
29213 := It's just so we can keep track of people. No one leaves the city without a Czerka hunting license.
29214 := I see that, but do you have the all important Chieftain's Gaffi? That was what you agreed to get for us.
29215 := Very well, but we need this matter taken care of.
29216 := Well, that is a very big headache that you have removed. I'm sure there are still Sand People out there, but they will be quieter now.
29217 := I think I'll give you a bonus for this. You've more than lived up to your side of the bargain. Czerka Corporation thanks you.
29218 := *ahem* While I respect your... forcefulness, I must remind you that ours are the finest, and only, guards in Anchorhead.
29219 := It would simply be inadvisable to attempt such an action in here. There would be no place for you to run. I don't fear you here.
29220 := [Success] And I wouldn't want you to leave without this additional reward. Yes, of course I wouldn't.
29221 := Once again, Czerka Corporation thanks you.
29222 := [Failure] I think you'll find that the reward I have given is more than adequate for the task. No more is deserved.
29223 := [Success] It would be valuable to have someone on call if the Sand People made another incursion. I think you're right.
29224 := Yes, here is an additional reward. Once again, Czerka Corporation thanks you.
29225 := I'm sure. Czerka Corporation thanks you again.
29226 := Then I'll take those off your hands, but the real prize is still out there.
29227 := Of course. You have done a good job for us and I'm happy to pay you.
29228 := Griff? Uh... there's no Griff here. Never heard of him. No, I... I don't remember a single Griff on the Czerka Corporation payroll.
29229 := That... may help in this instance. Let me think... perhaps I remember this Griff character.
29230 := [Success] Can you spare me a few moments? I have something I want to get off my chest. I want to tell you about one of our workers. His name was Griff.
29231 := [Failure] I'm sorry, but Czerka Corporation officials do not accept bribes. Now, unless you're interested in our bounties or some other business I'm going to have to ask you to leave!
29232 := [Success] Oh, you mean that Twi'lek! Must have slipped my mind for a second. Yes, of course I remember Griff.
29233 := We hired that Twi'lek some time ago. Not a good worker according to his crew chief: always complaining and faking injuries to get out of work.
29234 := He entered false time sheets and slept through his shifts. We even suspected him of stealing Czerka Corporation supplies, although we could never prove it.
29235 := We would've fired him but we needed workers. It would have been better for him if he had been fired. Then the Sand People wouldn't have gotten him.
29236 := He was lost in a Sand People raid we suffered not too long ago. There were prisoners taken, but our rescue parties never found anyone alive.
29237 := In the end it just wasn't cost effective to keep searching. All miners sign a waiver absolving Czerka Corporation of liability in these circumstances.
29238 := We didn't find his body so we have to assume he was taken prisoner. Whether he's still alive, I couldn't say.
29239 := That's all I can tell you. I shouldn't even have said this much; this is all privileged corporate information. I could lose my job!
29240 := As I said, all employees have signed waivers absolving Czerka Corporation of any financial liability if this occurs. It is the industry standard.
29241 := I suppose you could apply for special dispensation from the Czerka Corporation Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours only, please.
29242 := Czerka Corporation cares deeply for all of its employees. That's why we've started a bounty program to thin the Sand People numbers. 
29243 := I have to go. Goodbye.
29244 := Anything out of the ordinary happening?
29245 := No desire to mistakenly associate with the losing side, hmm?
29246 := Know about anything more local?
29247 := I want to ask about Czerka Corporation.
29248 := May I ask how your operations here on Tatooine are doing?
29249 := [Force Persuade] It would be better if you told me now.
29250 := [Persuade] Why the secrets? The company stuck you here. Tell me.
29251 := What do you mean the planet was abandoned before?
29252 := Does this mean you have plans to pull out?
29253 := What makes the ore substandard?
29254 := I wanted to ask about your activities on Kashyyyk.
29255 := Which is very convenient if one branch is charged with misconduct.
29256 := I want to ask about our agreement.
29257 := There may be a nonviolent solution to this.
29258 := I want to ask about hunting licenses.
29259 := Let's go back to my first questions.
29260 := Have there been a lot of people leaving the city?
29261 := What was it you wanted me to do for a license?
29262 := There is no way to get a license?
29263 := I will agree to do this for you.
29264 := I'll go get to it then.
29265 := I don't want to do this.
29266 := Why pay for the gaffi sticks? Why not their heads?
29267 := Why would I need a license anyway?
29268 := I have gaffi sticks to redeem for bounties.
29269 := I was mistaken. I'll be back later.
29270 := Yes, here it is.
29271 := Hand over more or I bury you the same as the Sand People.
29272 := [Force Persuade] You want to give me an additional reward.
29273 := [Persuade] For a bit more I could maintain my vigilence in the future.
29274 := That amount will suffice.
29275 := Just the regular ones for now.
29276 := I'm looking for a miner named Griff.
29277 := Never mind. I want to ask you about something else.
29278 := Maybe 20 credits will refresh your memory?
29279 := [Force Persuasion] You want to tell me about Griff.
29280 := [Persuade] Are you certain of that? I would leave sooner if I knew.
29281 := So you fired him?
29282 := Yes, that sounds like him.
29283 := You mean he's dead?
29284 := The Sand People?
29285 := Did the Sand People kill Griff or not!
29286 := Is there some type of reward for saving him?
29287 := So your workers are all expendable?
29288 := You again? You want to buy something? If not, go bother the officers.
29289 := Oh, a swoop-jock, hmm? I know I don't have the crazy suicide parts you're looking for.
29290 := Yes? What is it? If this is about mining or Sand People, you go to the Czerka officers. I just manage the storehouse.
29291 := Bye then. Come back if you need any supplies.
29292 := Is that a coy way of referring to Taris going down? You don't want my views on that.
29293 := You know what? At least the Sith seem to make things happen. How old is the Republic? 15,000 years? It's stagnant.
29294 := Every year ships get a little faster, droids get a little smarter, and people get a little fatter. That's about it for progress.
29295 := I suspect I'd do just as much grunt-labor under them as I do now. They'll at least shake things up.
29296 := You say that like you know something. Well, keep it to yourself. I like to watch this change from a distance, thanks.
29297 := Nobody's innocent once their mother has left the room. That's just my view.
29298 := Don't care about them. I stay in the Czerka compound. We could be on a pleasure world, for all I care or know.
29299 := Well, the cost increase of kolto is downright weird. Maybe the Selkath think the destruction of Taris scared people enough they will pay inflated prices for medical supplies.
29300 := Well, it's odd that I'm talking to the Manaan Sector Champion, but with Taris gone you likely don't have much choice about where to race.
29301 := I hear the Sith are wasting their efforts fighting among themselves when they should be getting things done. Like they did on Taris.
29302 := Then go ask a Czerka officer. I just collect my credits at the end of the day, just like the miners or guards.
29303 := It doesn't matter what I think. Maybe they'll pull out, maybe they won't. I'll man the store on the next rock.
29304 := Look, it's not my business what Czerka Corporation does somewhere else. I don't even care what they do *here*.
29305 := Now, what would the officers say? Oh yes. Go talk to the Kiosk on Coruscant. You want to buy something or not?
29306 := Very well, though I do have work to get back to.
29307 := Their operations on Kashyyyk are in more trouble than you or I could ever give them. Of course, they would never admit that.
29308 := I don't much care about how Czerka operates, but I get a chuckle out of anything that gives them grief.
29309 := Not my affair. You want to hunt for Czerka Corporation you talk to the Protocol Officer.
29310 := Mostly just standard Czerka provisions and supplies. Not enough to keep the locals happy. Have a look.
29311 := Was there something specific you were looking for? You seem like you are looking for unique things.
29312 := Take a look. The best stocked storehouse on Tatooine. Not that that's saying much.
29313 := I may, but that is not something I usually sell to spacers. You don't look like a moisture farmer. What do you want them for?
29314 := Of course, of course, I'll show you what I have, but don't push your luck with those threats. It's not polite.
29315 := No, I suppose not. It wouldn't have mattered. Well, let me tell you what I have, then.
29316 := Ah, exactly the kind of appeasement that Czerka Corporation doesn't like to support in their policies. I like it.
29317 := Well, I have two of the finest vaporators that Czerka Corporation produces. Of course, they only produce one model right now.
29318 := The price is 400 credits for the pair. I won't break them up. They function best when linked together.
29319 := I'm sorry, but that is as low as I can go. There's nothing I can do about it. Czerka regulations, you know.
29320 := Well, I don't think that's very likely. I have to cover my costs, you know.
29321 := You're a big something, but not so much a threat. That won't work on me, not in the heart of Anchorhead.
29322 := If you did anything in here you wouldn't be safe anywhere. There are guards everywhere. Look, let's just do some honest business.
29323 := [Success] Of course I want to lower the price, but Czerka regulations... ah, who cares about those, right?
29324 := [Failure] I can't do it. I just can't. You'll have to come up with the money.
29325 := [Success] Well, I don't have much love for the company, not like little miss Protocol Officer over there.
29326 := I'll lower the price to 200 credits, but that is it. Don't even ask again.
29327 := I really don't think so. I don't know how, but you've already convinced me to lower it as much as I can. It's a good deal.
29328 := Fine, fine, I assume you'll be able to handle the deployment of them? They are surprisingly light.
29329 := It's a pleasure doing business with you. Do come again.
29330 := The price is 200 for the pair. I'm not sure how you talked me into that ridiculously low bargain, but there it is.
29331 := You're that friend of Griff, right? He gave me a message for you.
29332 := He told me to tell you that he made a mistake brewing the Tarisian ale. It didn't work out right for some reason.
29333 := He told me the tach gland was ruined. And he said he wasn't going to stick around and have to face his Exchange contact.
29334 := He hopped on board the last shuttle. I don't know where he was heading, but I can't say I'm sorry he's gone.
29335 := He was one of the worst employees I ever had. He was always on a break, he mixed up orders and I think he might have been stealing from me.
29336 := You and a dozen others. I was smart enough not to give him an advance on his wage, but you can kiss your credits goodbye.
29337 := People like Griff, they know how to disappear when they get in too deep. You won't hear from him again any time soon. Waste of time to even bother looking for him.
29338 := There was one last thing. He said to tell his sister goodbye. And to tell her he's sorry.
29339 := Damn it, Griff - won't you ever learn? How can my own flesh and blood be so stupid! 
29340 := I don't like the sound of this.
29341 := I have to go. Goodbye.
29342 := Anything out of the ordinary happening?
29343 := What about your opinions on Taris?
29344 := You like change; that's good.
29345 := Even if it means the deaths of innocents?
29346 := Okay, what about local events?
29347 := I want to ask about Czerka Corporation.
29348 := How do you think they are doing here on Tatooine?
29349 := Do you know about their operations on Kashyyyk?
29350 := And that absolves you of all responsibility?
29351 := Let's go back to my first questions.
29352 := I want to ask about bounties.
29353 := What do you have available for purchase?
29354 := No, just your normal fare.
29355 := Do you have any moisture vaporators?
29356 := You just show me what you have. Don't risk angering me!
29357 := That's not really your concern, is it?
29358 := To exchange with Sand People to stop their attacks.
29359 := I can't pay you right now.
29360 := Could you be persuaded to lower the price?
29361 := You'll do as I say. I'm the biggest threat in the room.
29362 := [Force Persuade] You want to lower the price.
29363 := [Persuade] Czerka's costs, not yours. Who cares about their money?
29364 := Perhaps I could try to persuade you once more?
29365 := I'll take the moisture vaporators for 400.
29366 := 200 for the moisture vaporators sounds fine to me.
29367 := I'm not surprised. Anything else?
29368 := What kind of mistake?
29369 := Did he say where he was going?
29370 := You just let him go?
29371 := You mean he's gone?
29372 := Good riddance!
29373 := That cheapskate owes me credits!
29374 := I have to go after him!
29375 := You're back! I knew you'd come through for me. I knew I could count on you! Uh... you do have a tach gland for me, right?
29376 := Changed your mind? No... you can't! Eh... do you know what this guy from the Exchange will do to me if I don't come through? Come on, you have to help me here!
29377 := Sorry, like I said before I don't have any credits on me. And Greeta won't lend me any. It's like he doesn't trust me to pay him back or something.
29378 := But you come through on this and I promise you'll get a huge payday down the road. Two... no! Three thousand credits! How's that sound?
29379 := Come to papa you sweet simian organ! It may not look like much, but once I turn this into a bottle of Tarisian ale it'll end up being worth a fortune!
29380 := You know, once we synthesize this and start brewing Tarisian ale in mass quantities we're going to be looking for some investors.
29381 := You give me a couple hundred credits and I can get you in on the ground floor. You'll get a return of... oh, at least twenty times your investment!
29382 := You don't know much about business, do you? When an opportunity like this comes along you have to jump at it! Come on, what do you say?
29383 := Whoa - no need to get violent. I can take the hint. I was just trying to do you a favor, but I see you're not interested.
29384 := It's your loss. I better get started brewing that ale. Meet me back here later and I'll give you a downpayment on what I owe you.
29385 := Wise move. I can see you really understand how business works: now, when you see your chance, you jump at it! Heh, that's my motto.
29386 := I better get started on brewing that ale. Meet me back here later and I'll have a downpayment on what I owe you.
29387 := Hey, don't worry, you'll get your credits as soon as we start mass producing that Tarisian ale. I just wanted to know if you were interested in an even bigger payoff.
29388 := Thanks, Mission. You won't regret helping me out with this!
29389 := Please, Griff. Let this be the last time. No more cons. No more scams. No more schemes. That's all I ask.
29390 := Hey, sis, no need to worry about that. I've turned over a new leaf. From now on I'm going to stay out of trouble and do things right.
29391 := And once we've cornered the market on Tarisian ale good things will be heading my way. Then I'll make it up to you, Mission. Just wait - you'll see!
29392 := This wasn't my idea, Griff. If it was up to me I'd let the Exchange deal with you!
29393 := Geez, sis - that's pretty harsh. Come on, I know things haven't been great between us but when I corner the market on Tarisian ale I'll make things up to you!
29394 := Forget it, Griff. Don't you understand? It's too late - you're dead to me now. I don't want anything more to do with you. Ever.
29395 := Okay, that's the way you want it. But when I'm rich you're going to regret saying that!
29396 := Ah, just the person I was hoping to see!
29397 := Mission didn't come with you, I see. Uh... guess she's still mad at me. Oh well... it's probably for the best. This job is more up your alley anyway.
29398 := Hmph! Save it Griff - I'm still not talking to you! I want no part of whatever you're involved in!
29399 := Okay, sis - I see you're still mad. Fair enough. I don't think you could help me with this anyway. It's uh... more of a job for your friend here.
29400 := As you may know, tach glands can be refined into a very potent powder. It's the primary ingredient in Tarisian ale - that's what makes it so strong.
29401 := Of course, now that Taris is pretty much wiped from the face of the map Tarisian ale has become somewhat scarce - and uh... very, very valuable. Luckily, I know the secret recipe!
29402 := I know this guy... he's with the Exchange. Now, if I give him a small sample of Tarisian ale he says he can synthesize it and reproduce it in mass quantities.
29403 := Problem is, I need one of those tach glands to make the first batch. And now that Taris is a smoking ruin, the only place to find tach is on Kashyyyk.
29404 := If you can get your hands on one of those tach glands I'll make it worth your while.
29405 := Sorry, like I said before I don't have any credits on me. And Greeta won't lend me any credits. I mean, it's like he doesn't trust me to pay him back or something.
29406 := But you come through on this and I promise you'll get a huge payday down the road. Two... no! Three thousand credits! How's that sound?
29407 := Griff, are you blind? Can't you see you're talking to a Jedi? We're out here trying to save the galaxy! We can't waste time on this!
29408 := Please, you have to help me! I... I promised this guy from the Exchange a sample of Tarisian ale! If I don't come through for him he's going to break my legs... or worse!
29409 := Come on, I'm Mission's brother! I'm her family! I mean, think what she'll do if you just let the Exchange kill me! Besides, this is a sweet deal!
29410 := Come on, Mission - I'm your brother! I'm family! You can't turn your back on me!
29411 := Forget it, Griff, I'm not falling for that line again. You'll have to find your own way out of this mess!
29412 := You bring me a single tach gland and you not only save my life but you get a piece of this great business opportunity! I mean, you can't pass this up! Think about it and you'll see I'm right.
29413 := Yeah, I knew you'd come through for me! You won't regret this... you'll see! Uh... just... just don't take too long, okay? This guy from the Exchange could stop by any day.
29414 := I kind of told him I already had the stuff, so if he shows up and I'm empty handed... well, let's just say I really, really hope it doesn't come to that.
29415 := I'll be back when I have that tach gland.
29416 := I've changed my mind, I'm not doing this.
29417 := I'm not giving you the gland until I see some credits!
29418 := Here's the tach gland. Take it.
29419 := I've done more than enough for you already!
29420 := Ask me again and that tach gland won't be the only freshly harvested organ around here!
29421 := I don't need business advice from you, Griff.
29422 := Okay, here's 200 credits.
29423 := You already promised me a few thousand credits.
29424 := Come on, Griff, get to the point.
29425 := What's the job?
29426 := What does this have to do with me?
29427 := So you want to open a bar?
29428 := I don't have time for this, I'm trying to save the galaxy!
29429 := What's in this for me?
29430 := Sorry, Griff - I don't trust you.
29431 := That's what you get for dealing with the Exchange.
29432 := Don't worry, Griff, we'll get those tach glands for you.

29623 := Careful! If that happens again they could all explode! No way I would survive that!
29624 := Hey, you did it! You got them going! All right boys, give me some space.
29625 := What the...! What did you do? Oh no...
29626 := Well, nice to see you again. Ah, not to pressue you - certainly, no pressure - but you did say you'd rescue me.
29627 := You asked for nothing in return... but really, soon would be nice.
29628 := Well, normally I'd be patient, but the constant threat of death is just so stressful. You know?
29629 := We've been over this, haven't we? My wife has put some kind of kink in my battle droids. If I move, they're threatening to explode.
29630 := I haven't got a clue where to start. She knew I wouldn't. Please, repair them for me if you can.
29631 := If you expect me to give up hunting, speedy service would be nice.
29632 := You asked for credits, after all. Speedy service would be nice.
29633 := It's just that I had hoped you could do this with a little more... I don't know... success? I won't survive another blast.
29634 := I mean, I can certainly see how you'd want to keep me in one place. You ladies can be so coy...
29635 := So, uh... what's new? Uh, rescued anyone recently? You know, maybe someone trapped in the desert! 
29636 := That was... unpleasant. Thanks for your help. I would have been a goner. Heh, and the old bat thought I was dead. HA!
29637 := You never asked me for anything, but I consider my life worth something. Please, take this. I insist.
29638 := What else could I give you? I need what I have to repair my droids and get back up and running.
29639 := You shouldn't have fixed the droids first, then. Rally on my target, boys!
29640 := [Success] I'd... really like to pay you more. Here... take whatever I have. It's all yours.
29641 := How did... how did you get me to do that? Damn, that's what got me married and into this mess! That's it, I'm leaving!
29642 := [Failure] Look, I really can't. I'm sorry.
29643 := [Success] I suppose I do. That's pretty smart to appeal to what I think my safety is worth. Here.
29644 := Now, if you don't mind, I have to limp these boys back to my shop. Hopefully Marlena didn't take the manuals with her.
29645 := I love it when the ladies play hard-to-please, but there isn't much more I can do. This is an expensive setback.
29646 := Thanks again. I doubt any of those uptight hunters would have helped, and I doubt the wife is coming back.
29647 := I'm heading back to the shop... I hope she left the manuals for these things behind. Ungrateful little...
29648 := You wanted me to give up my trade. Well, consider it done. Maybe I can rent my droids for security or something.
29649 := You wanted credits for your trouble, and I never break a deal. Here's uh, all I have on me.
29650 := Now, my dear lady, I must see to your reward. Will, uh, earthly delights suffice? Er... I suppose not.
29651 := Hey there, thanks for stopping. I appreciate it. I've been stuck without water for hours. Wasn't looking good.
29652 := Oh, hey, it's you. I remember you at Fazza's place. Could I get you to help out a fellow hunter? Please?
29653 := Could you... hey, I remember you. You're the young lady from Fazza's club. Talk about answered prayers.
29654 := Now if you could... oh no... not you. Just my luck. Look, I don't want any trouble, just need a little help.
29655 := I don't remember you from Fazza's club. You new to Anchorhead? Could you maybe help me get out of here?
29656 := What? Oh, right, thanks. I guess I'll just DIE! Come on, help a guy out!
29657 := I'll bet she does. She's decided I've finally worn out my welcome, and she's "fixed" my droids to do her dirty work.
29658 := Well, ah, it would appear that I worn out my welcome with my wife Marlena. She fixes my droids... heh, fixed them good this time.
29659 := I triggered some sort of trap she programmed. She probably figured I wouldn't be smart enough to get out. Uh, she was right.
29660 := Something about me not following her archaic rules for proper conduct in a marriage. I swear, I never saw this coming.
29661 := Hey, I'm the victim here. I'm not sure how divorce works where you're from, but this is a little extreme, don't you think?
29662 := You know, now really isn't the time for a lecture. Of course, I might be more receptive after I'm rescued.
29663 := Look friend, some may talk about honor in the hunt, but they still sell their trophies.
29664 := You're beautiful, but not too bright. I hunt to make a living. Other hunters talk about honor, but they still sell their trophies.
29665 := The wife put a kink in my battle droids. They're in some sort of discharge loop, and if I move from this spot, they're threatening to blow up.
29666 := She knew I wouldn't know how to fix them. Could you try to do some repairs? They don't care if you move. It's just me who's stuck.
29667 := I'd, ahh, really appreciate a bit of help. Please?
29668 := What? Why? What did I do to you?
29669 := Well, I suppose I couldn't ask for a more valid reason than that. That's all?! That's it?! What are you, my wife?
29670 := So you just want me to die? That is just... so... typical of the people I meet... and marry. Thanks a lot!
29671 := So my life is worth less than a few wraid? How many? One? Ten? Twenty?
29672 := Oh, so this will be some sort of lesson for me, just because I don't "thank the bones" or some garbage?
29673 := Well fine, I'll... stay pretty much right here I guess. You can just get lost. I'll... I'll...
29674 := Heh heh. You're kidding, right. Right? Come on!
29675 := Phew! Don't scare me like that. All right, lesson learned, or whatever. Can you please try to get them going?
29676 := Nobody looks out for their neighbor anymore. Well, if this is it, I'd rather get it over with and maybe take you out with me.
29677 := So, let's see how these rigged-out droids like me jumping around. Hopefully the explosion kills you too!
29678 := Uh, what did you have in mind?
29679 := Well of course, darling. Anything at all.
29680 := Uh, sure, I apologize. Uh, now, about what you wanted?
29681 := Hey, wait for a moment. I need these rigs. I'm no marksman. No way I can agree to that. No way.
29682 := [Success] I won't use droids. You have to make sure the hunt goes on, right? Eh, now, could you help?
29683 := [Failure] I can't do it. That's my living. I'd have to leave this rock altogether. I can't do it.
29684 := [Success] Well, when you put it like that. *ahem* Very well then, if it will get you to help me.
29685 := Hey, no problem, but it won't be a fortune or anything. I'd bet the wife has drained our shared accounts. Now uh, about that help?
29686 := Just access each droid's repair interface. You'll have to do some tinkering, but be careful. One explosion I can survive. Any more than one and I'm dead.
29687 := Oh, and ignore the message Marlena left in there. No way do I deserve this, I swear.
29688 := Beep! Beeple beep!
29689 := Hey yeah! You've got yourself a 'mech droid, there! Tell it to do it! Please!
29690 := *mechanical splurch... unflattering sound*
29691 := Hey, now... did your droid just spit at me? I just need a little help here.
29692 := Commentary: I say we blast the meatbag and save you the trouble, master.
29693 := What's with all the droids, lately? My wife get to you, too?
29694 := Negative. I just don't like organic meatbags. Except for the master, of course. Ha ha.
29695 := Maybe we could program them to tap-dance? I love a good tap-dance.
29696 := This isn't funny! Come on!
29697 := I say leave him.
29698 := You're pretty heartless for such a pretty lady, you know?
29699 := I take it back. Let's congratulate his wife.
29700 := *sigh* I guess we should help him out.
29701 := Yes! Yes, I knew I liked this fella the minute I saw him.
29702 := Well... wait a minute... it looks like you've already taken care of things. Well that's great! Take that, Marlena, I'm going to live!
29703 := This should be interesting...
29704 := Commentary: One would hope the female is better at repairs than Yuka Laka. I still would like to crush his neck, master.
29705 := Philandering ways coming back to haunt him, I'll wager.
29706 := Oh great! You just get away from me! The last thing I need is Sand People trying to cut me up! Go on! I've got blasters!
29707 := What the... uh, yeah! You just get out of here! Hey I... I guess I'm pretty scary... trapped, but scary.
29708 := Oh... yeah I, uh, I knew that.
29709 := Anyone out there...? Could you help? I seem to be... ah... doomed.
29710 := Hold on there! How about talking to me before you go messing with those things? I need your help.
29711 := I'll get to it soon enough.
29712 := I've changed my mind. I'm not helping you.
29713 := I've decided that I want something in exchange.
29714 := What was it I needed to do?
29715 := You'll give me more or you will regret it.
29716 := I think I should ask for more.
29717 := Then I'll have to take it out of your hide!
29718 := [Force Persuade] You will pay me more and like it.
29719 := [Persuade] You know the rescue was worth more.
29720 := All right. Just get out of here, then.
29721 := That will be fine. Good luck.
29722 := I don't have time for this right now. Goodbye.
29723 := You're Tanis, right? Your wife says hello.
29724 := What happened here?
29725 := Why would she do this?
29726 := You don't seem too concerned about what triggered this.
29727 := You sit back and let your droids do the hunting?
29728 := It just doesn't seem very sporting.
29729 := What do you want me to do?
29730 := I'm not doing anything for you. You can rot here.
29731 := I just don't like you. Goodbye.
29732 := It's the cruelest death. Maybe I'll watch while sipping ice water.
29733 := It's better for the environment if I don't let you hunt.
29734 := You don't respect the hunt. You are a disgrace.
29735 := All right, I'll see what I can do.
29736 := I'm not kidding. You'll die here.
29737 := I'll help, but I want something in return.
29738 := One more "darling" and you'll be sorry, understand?
29739 := You'll have to give up hunting with droids.
29740 := [Force Persuade] You will no longer use droids to hunt. Ever.
29741 := [Persuade] Look around. You don't have much choice.
29742 := I'll help if you give me credits. All you've got.
29743 := All right, I'll try and help out. Hold on.
29744 := [Leave]
29745 := Easy, I'm no threat. It's just a disguise.
29746 := Having fun on the dunes, Tanis? I made sure you
would. Here's the deal: Your precious droids have
trapped you. They'll hold you until you die of thirst.
Make a mistake while repairing them, they explode.
Have a good death. My mother was right about you.
29747 := Hello there. You're heading out to the desert? You're a hunter right? You must be if you've been allowed to leave Anchorhead.
29748 := When you see Tanis, and I know you old boys always stick together, tell him his wife hopes he enjoys the anniversary gift.
29749 := You're just another of his buddies from that "hunting" club. I know your kind. You all cover for each other, I bet.
29750 := When you see Tanis, and I know you know him, tell him his wife hopes he enjoys the anniversary gift.
29751 := Oh, I'll be long gone soon enough. The next shuttle to... anywhere, really. I've had it with cleaning up his messes, repairing his droids.
29752 := If he lives, he can try and get by on his own. I doubt he'll last long with no one to listen to his lies.
29753 := Just a little something to remember me by. Something that symbolizes our years together. Something that will blow up in his face.
29754 := Of course, he'll never understand how appropriate it is. He can't talk his way out of this one. He's not smart enough.
29755 := Don't play dumb. You're just another of his playthings down at that "hunting" club. I know your type through and through.
29756 := Well, he can do what he wants. He'll get what he deserves. I bought my own license just so I could see that he did.
29757 := Oh, I'm through planning. I just left him a little mess that he has to take care of. If he's smart, he'll be just fine.
29758 := But he's not smart.
29759 := I'm sure you do. Like I said, when you see him, tell him his wife Marlena says hello.
29760 := What do you mean by "you old boys"?
29761 := Um, all right? What if he has a message for you?
29762 := Anniversary gift? What are you talking about?
29763 := Why do you think I would know him?
29764 := You sound like you're planning to kill him.
29765 := I have to go.
29766 := Don't let me die under here! Please!
29767 := Anyone! I'm trapped under here! Please help me!
29768 := Help! Please! Over here! Under the wreckage!
29769 := Haw haw! *snort* We gots you good now!
29770 := *squeee!*
29771 := We did a good ambush and you and you better pay... uh... maybe 500 credits now! You die otherwise! 
29772 := Uh... what? Gurke said they be easy picking!
29773 := Shut up, stupid! *snort* They are just bluffing you! They got no hope at all!
29774 := What? Attack them! They trying to fight!
29775 := [Success] Wuh! Ah, we are sorry about everything! Yeah, everything! We'll leave now!
29776 := They don't seem that scary to me, Gurke. You sure?
29777 := Shut up and run, stupid! You want to die? Yeesh!
29778 := [Failure] Bah! you are nothing! You talk and talk but got nothing to show! I think we shut you up now!
29779 := [Success] Ah... maybe... maybe this time we play on the safe side. Yeah, maybe this time.
29780 := Gurke, are we leaving? Who's gonna pay for the ambush stuff?
29781 := Shut up, stupid! Just go. *snort*
29782 := Uh... you will? Of course you will! You roll over good!
29783 := But... Gurke said you types have lots of money!
29784 := Shut up! You got nothing? Bah! Then we kill you for your gear stuff!
29785 := What? Then you pay whatever you got! Yeah!
29786 := Hmm... not much... but maybe that's good enough. You roll over good.
29787 := Yeah, maybe we play with you again some time.
29788 := Haw! Maybe! You go where you want, now. We won't hurt you. Haw! *snort*
29789 := What? Why would we stop? You look pretty weak right now. We got you good!
29790 := [Success] We let you go now. We got what we wanted. Yeah, we sure did.
29791 := Uh, Gurke? They didn't give us nothing.
29792 := Shut up! We got what we wanted! Now we go! That's how this works! Yeesh. *snort*
29793 := [Failure] Bah! No way are we going to let you go. In fact, I think you should get shut up now!
29794 := Yeah, we are sick of the talking!
29795 := Shut up and get ready to fight. Stupid.
29796 := [Success] Hey, we get pretty good reputation if you run around all scaredy. Haw! I like it!
29797 := Okay, we will leave you alone here. You count yourself lucky! Yeah, you real lucky. *snort*
29798 := This isn't tough to figure out, you know. You don't pay, we bury you here!
29799 := Yeah, out here in the sand!
29800 := Please help! I can't get out! (click) 3... 2... 1.
29801 := Who are you to threaten me? I could be dangerous.
29802 := That's it! You're all going to die!
29803 := [Force Persuade] You fear me! Cower, little piggy!
29804 := [Persuade] I could be a powerful Jedi. Will you risk it?
29805 := Fine, I'll pay. Just leave me alone.
29806 := I don't have any credits. None at all.
29807 := I don't have 500 credits.
29808 := Fine, here is every credit I have. Take it all.
29809 := Perhaps I could persuade you not to do this?
29810 := [Force Persuade] You want to let me go. You got what you came for.
29811 := [Persuade] If you let me go, I'll tell others how smart you are.
29812 := And if I refuse to pay you anything?
29813 := What choice do we have? They have to be killed. All of them.
29814 := How am I supposed to make a living with this going on?
29815 := They should all be wiped out. Every last one of them.
29816 := Is it safe? Heh. Is anywhere safe? I don't think so.
29817 := I guess I'm lucky to be alive. No more of this for me, that's for sure.
29818 := Thanks for your help. I hope there's no more of those animals out there.
29819 := These Sand People are vicious. They attacked without any reason.
29820 := They were like animals. It was horrible.
29821 := Dozens of them attacked. I think the Captain's afraid there are more out there.
29822 := Barely got a shot off. That Captain will tell you all about it.
29823 := Out of nowhere, they came! I don't think the Captain even saw them coming.
29824 := Well, you should speak with the Captain. He's the only officer we've got left.
29825 := Don't hurt me! Please!
29826 := Thanks for your help. I don't think we'll try holding this position for much longer. We're not soldiers.
29827 := Did the company send you? It's about time they drove these animals out!
29828 := I don't have time for this sort of thing. I'm through with the desert. You can take your Sand People, krayt dragons, and crazy hunters.
29829 := Well you've got a lot of work ahead of you. Do you know about their enclave in the south? Don't even try to go near it.
29830 := They've taken all the Czerka weapons that were supposed to protect our sandcrawlers. That place is a fortress. A death trap.
29831 := You'll have to find some way to sneak into the place. Glad it's not my job.
29832 := Yeah, so do we. There's no way we're repairing this thing while getting attacked over and over. The desert can have it.
29833 := Ah, the Jawas will salvage it eventually anyway. Then we can buy it back and start over. Heh. Makes sense to me.
29834 := Just that they attack everything on sight. Well, I suppose they don't attack each other, but any outsider is as good as dead.
29835 := The company tried to arm us, and even set up remote self-powered turrets on the mining route, but...but that just made things worse.
29836 := It's like a fortress now. I don't know how you're going to break through all of that. Me, I'd sneak in. Well, actually, I would just get back to Anchorhead.
29837 := Who are you? Ah. It doesn't matter. Can you handle a blaster? They may attack again at any second.
29838 := I doubt we could hold out on our own against another wave of them.
29839 := Nothing in the job description covers this. Wait... well I guess we'll see how you fare. Here they come again!
29840 := You would be right. Came out of nowhere. Wait... Damn it! Here they come again! How do they do that!
29841 := N-now hold on, we don't want any trouble... please?
29842 := They... left? Well if that don't beat all.
29843 := Scared the living Force right out of me with that trick. You do that way too well. I thought our number was up for sure.
29844 := I have other questions about the desert.
29845 := I've agreed to try and stop the Sand People attacks.
29846 := I have to go.
29847 := Do you know anything about the Sand People?
29848 := You miners are cowards. A single attack wiped you out?
29849 := I would assume this was done by the Sand People?
29850 := [Leave]
29851 := I'm no threat. I'm just wearing their robes.
29852 := So we have found it. Father's holocron. I suppose I should be thankful the desert sands had not swallowed it up.
29853 := I don't know. I'll...I'll have to think about that. I'll keep it on me while I decide.
29854 := Are you going to give it to your mother?

29947 := Translation: He will take us before the Chieftain, as he was instructed to do.
29948 := [Leave quietly]
29949 := Let me pass! I demand it!
29950 := Tell him to move aside or we'll make him!

29977 := Shh! Footfalls quiet, there is a great predator just within the cave. Care must be taken.
29978 := Time wears on. Have you found the bantha fodder integral to our plan? This dragon will not reveal himself for our paltry scent.
29979 := Bantha must be led to the cave to spur the beast out in the open. He will have a quick death after that.
29980 := Allow them to get closer to the cave. They will trigger the dragon's hunger, but as pungent as they are, they must be closer.
29981 := Good. Now, there is a herd that moves out in the desert. Lead them here. Approach them with the fodder and lead them here.
29982 := You are back? There is still time to pursue the hunt, human. Will you aid me?
29983 := Quickly, be ready. The banthas are in position and will soon stir our restless prey. I hope the mines do their job quickly.
29984 := Wait... what is that rumbling sound? Oh boy, he's a big one.
29985 := It is done, and the great beast is dead. To my shame, I denied him a final fight, but I will honor his memory to make amends.
29986 := You, however, will not. You did nothing against the beast. You will have no share of the kill.
29987 := But you didn't so much as damage it! It is atounding I was able to bring it down without your help! You endangered me and yourself with your inaction.
29988 := I thank you for your aid, human. You have earned a share of the victory, such as it is.
29989 := Will I? I don't think so. You have been given what you are worth. Respect the hunt and leave it at that.
29990 := And I will warn you, no words will change my mind. Regardless of the circumstances, respect for the hunt governs me. I will die defending it.
29991 := You flatter more than I am worth, given the circumstances. Any technician can place explosives. The only difference is that I feel shame about it.
29992 := I thank you for your help here today, human. I shall see you again, I am sure.
29993 := Regrettably so. I just hope you remember there were higher reasons for this. Don't let the spoils be your only reason to hunt. Wealth fades. The sands remain.
29994 := I thought I would see you out here, human. We are hunters, you and I. Perhaps... we should pool our skills...
29995 := I have tracked a very special beast to its lair. A krayt dragon rests within, and tonight he is the hunted, although by unorthodox means.
29996 := I have no knowledge of that, but there may be something in there. There are signs that this lair was purposefully dug out.
29997 := Krayt are opportunistic, and may have lazily moved into someone else's excavation. Of course, we must remove him to see.
29998 := I might very well ask you why you shouldn't? I haven't threatened you, human. I have merely asked you to help me.
29999 := Perhaps I should question you. I have said my reason for being out here. I can't be certain you are trustworthy.
30000 := You are here, they are not. I also didn't know the size of my quarry until I was tracking him. And perhaps there are... other reasons.
30001 := I tried to get the help of one other, but you saw him die in the lair. He lacked experience and, more importantly, patience.
30002 := I usually hunt for the skill of it, but must make an exception today. I want newcomers to understand the proper intent behind the hunt, no matter the methods we use.
30003 := We each have our reasons. You might select "challenge" or "glory" as your own. "Profit" is also valid.
30004 := When bull dragons reach this size it is rumored that they have a number of pearls within them. You would receive a generous share.
30005 := Nobody from our lodge has successfully hunted a bull dragon in perhaps a decade. My father may have been the last. His words are what I go by.
30006 := That is true, but this is a very critical fight. Bull dragons are rare to see. Rarer still is the apparent size of this one.
30007 := It is larger than the one my father felled a decade ago, and he is too far out of his territory and must be dealt with. I might not prevail alone, human, but I must try.
30008 := That is too bad. The hunt will have to wait for you. I can't do this alone.
30009 := You don't have much choice now. You've already led the banthas into position. The beast will be stirring soon enough.
30010 := We must bait the great beast out of hiding and ambush him swiftly. There is no room to engage him in the lair, and his hide will repel blaster fire.
30011 := I have placed mines around the mouth of the cave. We must coax him out, but this is the end of his season of hibernation. It will take much to rouse him.
30012 := The food of a beast this size is almost exclusively banthas... and foolish hunters, if we are not careful. To lure him out we must lure his food to tempt him.
30013 := They too have their food of choice. We must find some bantha fodder to lead the banthas here. I have a few ideas about where this may be found.
30014 := Sand People keep bantha herds, so some of them must have fodder on hand or in their settlement. A vendor in Anchorhead also had some. He had a kiosk in the spaceport.
30015 := If you find fodder and bait the banthas here, the mines will deal with the dragon as it emerges to feed. Not exactly a glorious hunt, but it will ensure the safety of the region.
30016 := What do you mean, human? This task is better attempted together. You won't leave now, will you?
30017 := I have spent many years following in the memory of my father. I can't step away from a battle like this.
30018 := No words can express my distaste for you. If you intend to take what I worked for, you will have to fight for it.
30019 := No, I won't allow you to simply walk away. You could return when I am weak or unsuspecting. I won't allow it.
30020 := No we won't. You would simply turn on me at earliest convenience. I won't have that. It's too late for that.
30021 := Defend yourself, human! You will die here!
30022 := We shall see, human!
30023 := I wish you luck against the Sand People. When you return, the dragon will fall. I wish it could be under more sporting circumstances, but we must do what the circumstances call for.
30024 := I had hoped for a mirror of my father's expedition, but that will have to wait.
30025 := I have spent a long time tracking this creature. Many hunters do not return from such searches. I have earned my place here.
30026 := And, if I didn't mention it, I am interested in having new hunters like you understand that even though I must use untraditional methods, the hunted still deserves respect.
30027 := I can't attempt this alone. If you won't help, I will have to wait for another hunter to come. The offer stands, if you change your mind.
30028 := You have already done what you must. You have intuitively led the banthas to this place. Your skills as a hunter may surpass mine in time.
30029 := The natural cycle on Tatooine spans hundreds of years, but there are complications that must be addressed. Complications from our presence.
30030 := Krayt dragons feed on banthas. If the numbers of either species fall, the other grows too numerous, and unbalances the cycle.
30031 := Now settlers use banthas, so there are less for dragons to eat. This one is moving closer to Anchorhead. Perhaps there will be more, but he is the threat tonight.
30032 := Greetings to you, human. I believe I saw you in Anchorhead. I thought I would see you on the dunes. You look like a hunter.
30033 := Perhaps you are interested in the ways of the hunt? Will you help me? I have tracked a very special beast to its lair.
30034 := A krayt dragon, the largest of the Tatooine desert predators. It is an honored creature to hunt, although we must use unorthodox methods today.
30035 := A valid question. This is a very critical fight. Bull dragons are rare to see. Rarer still is the apparent size of this one.
30036 := Good job! Come talk to me!
30037 := No time to talk with that dragon running around! We can't let it escape now that it's enraged.
30038 := I have led the bantha back to this location.
30039 := Look, I have your fodder.
30040 := I'm tired of running around like this.
30041 := I'll see what I can do.
30042 := Just do your part.
30043 := Don't worry, I'm ready.
30044 := I led the thing here! I found the fodder!
30045 := I want more. You will give me all of it.
30046 := I don't want it. Your skill made it possible.
30047 := Thanks. We did what had to be done.
30048 := I'm looking for a Star Map. It may be in this dragon's lair.
30049 := Why should I trust you?
30050 := Why do you want me and not another hunter?
30051 := Why would I want to do this?
30052 := Rumored? You don't know?
30053 := I thought you preferred the solo hunt.
30054 := I don't have time for this right now.
30055 := I'll help. Give me more information about how.
30056 := How will we lead the banthas here?
30057 := Thanks for the information. I don't need you anymore.
30058 := Leave? No, I'm going to take the kill for myself.
30059 := Bah! Then you are no use to me. I'm leaving.
30060 := Then we will continue with the hunt.
30061 := Then I will cut you down!
30062 := I will go find bantha fodder.
30063 := Why am I doing most of the legwork?
30064 := I'm not interested in this any more.
30065 := Why should we kill this great beast?
30066 := If it's such an honor, why do you want help?
30067 := This bantha is completely disinterested in you.
30068 := [This bantha perks up as you approach, obviously attracted to the smell of the fodder you are carrying. The whole herd falls in step.]
30069 := I'm tired of waiting, Komad. How big can this dragon of yours be? I'm going in!
30070 := What the...! Look at the size of it... Yeaaaarrrgh!!

30104 := Thanks will be yours. Reward will come in trade from Iziz.
30105 := You are back to us. Your kind leaves more often than that. Are you a rescuer that saves? Iziz must have sent.
30106 := You are not the ghostly giants that hold us trapped, the People of Sand. You are from the old city new.
30107 := Iziz must have sent your coming. Are you a rescuer? You must be.
30108 := The Jawas under Iziz know caution is best. Please return with speed so we can be free and out of here.
30109 := We thank you for this, if you mean to do it. It is unlike your kind, and will get rewards in trade.
30110 := Please return! The People of Sand lead with whip and gaffi. Iziz needs us free. He would reward you, we know!
30111 := We will answer if it leads to freedom.
30112 := Slaves to the People of Sand. We work before the whip. We scavenge and they pay with the hitting gaffi.
30113 := We trade with your kind, so we are weapons. They take what we find so you have less.
30114 := The city now founded by the group that digs, it is not new to you. We scavenge what came before.
30115 := It will fall again, some days from now. Or many days. That is what happens.
30116 := Eeeeee! We would not ask, and would not want to ask. If here, then there will be blood. So much blood.
30117 := He that leads the ghosts will find you. Find us. Let us out and free!
30118 := I hear of this! Iziz would know! We scavenge and see many things, and Iziz could tell, in trade for a rescue. Help us here, and then talk to him in the old city new.
30119 := Now please to you of your kind, help us get away from the gaffi and the whip.
30120 := We ask risk, but would trade for it. Iziz by the gates of the old city new would give much for our safety.
30121 := There are thanks you must have. The Jawas under Iziz will reward in trade. Find him and you will see.
30122 := Iziz will wait by the walls of your city that open to the sand. He'll trade fair. Thank you.
30123 := I'll release you later. I have to make sure it's safe first.
30124 := I'm not here to rescue you. Goodbye.
30125 := I need to ask you some questions.
30126 := Why were you taken captive?
30127 := What do you mean by "old city new"?
30128 := Where is the Sand People Chieftain?
30129 := I'm looking for something. A Star Map.
30130 := I'm not done asking questions.
30131 := If I let you out, this whole place will turn on me.
30132 := Run to Anchorhead. They'll be too busy fighting me to operate the turrets.
30133 := The Sand People said you can go. Run to Anchorhead.
30134 := Go to Anchorhead. They're too busy fighting me to operate the turrets.
30135 := [If you can read anything of the Sand People chieftain's emotions, it seems that he is surprised that you have returned.]
30136 := Translation: He did not expect us to return, master. He wonders if we have brought the moisture vaporators.
30137 := << Enter text here >>
30138 := Query: Is that wise, master? You went through the trouble of acquiring the vaporators, after all... not that I would mind a battle.
30139 := Conciliatory: I was not refusing, master. Quite the contrary, initiating attack sequence now!
30140 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30141 := Translation: He says that he has made his offer and there will be no further negotiation, master. Deliver the vaporators or face death. Shall I blast him now?
30142 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30143 := Translation: He does not trust you, master, but you have done more than any other outsider. They will not attack, and he grants you his Chieftain's Gaffi as reward.
30144 := Translation: The attacks will be reduced, and he will allow you to explore this enclave, but be warned that any lack of respect will result in death.
30145 := Commentary: Thank you, master. This should be fun.
30146 := Protocol: If you truly want this sadly peaceful arrangement to continue, be careful of what you ask.
30147 := [The Sand People Chieftain seems grateful to you, or at least less inclined to smash your head open like a pocky grub seed.]
30148 := [You can't understand him without HK-47 present, and you can tell that speaking to him in outsider tongue would be a grave insult.]
30149 := [The Sand People Chieftain ignores you.]
30150 := Query: What do you wish to ask of him, master?
30151 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30152 := Translation: We are free to leave.
30153 := Protocol: This will be a very sensitive topic, master. You will want to be careful with your questions or risk offending him. Not that that is much of a worry.
30154 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30155 := Translation: He says that the fact that you have to ask this is just one more example of your ignorance as an outsider, master. He says you are blind.
30156 := Translation: His people believe they are part of the land, living with it. You and your kind dare to raise yourself above it. You remove yourself.
30157 := Translation: That act of removal makes you an outsider, separate from all that is important. You could never understand how unwelcome you are.
30158 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30159 := Translation: He says that outsiders use machines to convey them, and to make their lives easier. This severs a connection with the land.
30160 := Translation: Connection to the soil must be made through flesh. A sacred animal is the only external tool to be used.
30161 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30162 := Translation: He says that the robes are sacred, master, and you would not understand. Sand People are never uncovered outside of the most private moments.
30163 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30164 := Translation: Never. That is their way, master.
30165 := Protocol: Is that wise, master? They may have assumed that the disguises you used were replicas instead of being taken off their dead.
30166 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30167 := Translation: The result is predictable. You have desecrated their dead. Happily, it seems the peace is over. It is time to kill.
30168 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30169 := Translation: He says that the use of these blasphemous things will only be tolerated because outsider interference has forced it upon them. 
30170 := Translation: If your kind had not come here, he would not have to defend their ways or their land.
30171 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30172 := Translation: He says that he will not, master. There is one Storyteller in each clan, and only he may recite the histories.
30173 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30174 := Translation: He says that you don't understand. They must never be told to someone who might say them incorrectly out of ignorance.
30175 := Translation: To speak them in error is a blasphemy punishable by death. Only their greatest warriors are even permitted to listen to the tales.
30176 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30177 := Translation: He doesn't know, master. His people usually kill outsiders. Since you are an outsider yourself, that would not suffice.
30178 := Translation: The greatest challenge for a warrior is to face a krayt dragon, the largest predator on Tatooine. Fight one of those and bring back a dragon pearl.
30179 := Disgust: I think he's making fun of you, master. He doesn't believe an outsider could do such a thing.
30180 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30181 := Translation: Stones polished in the gullet of the beast. Apparently they are valuable items.
30182 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30183 := Translation: He says there is a dragon in the Eastern Dune Sea that you could sacrifice yourself to. You already have a map to the area.
30184 := Translation: There is a dragon in the far Eastern Dune Sea, but he claims you could never defeat it. Here is a map to the area.
30185 := Translation: There is a hunter, a Twi'lek, that is sometimes seen out there. Perhaps he would be of some help.
30186 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30187 := Translation: He won't believe you until he sees a dragon pearl as proof. I should kill him for not taking you at your word, master.
30188 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30189 := Translation: He is stupefied, master. He never thought you could return with such an item. Such a thing has not been done in many years.
30190 := Translation: He will allow you to meet the Storyteller, but also gives a warning: if you dare to repeat the histories incorrectly, you will be killed.
30191 := Translation: The Storyteller will be summoned to one of the rooms here in the enclave. He seems to think this is a great honor for you, master.
30192 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30193 := Translation: You have been told that to be considered worthy of hearing the histories, you need to bring him a dragon pearl from a krayt dragon.
30194 := Translation: He says the discussion is closed until you fulfill this condition. He thinks you are just making fun of his traditions.
30195 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30196 := Translation: He says you may listen to the Storyteller, but if you dare to say the histories incorrectly, they will have you killed.
30197 := Clarification: We must be more specific, master. They capture many organics.
30198 := Protocol: We should not keep him long. It is an insult to take too much of his time. Unless the plan is to blast him when you are done, of course.
30199 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30200 := Translation: He says that by his very presence, this Griff defiles their home and land. He is without any semblance of usefulness to them.
30201 := Extrapolation: I would assume we are free to take him. It is doubtful they will even waste the effort to kill him. Perhaps we could do it, master?
30202 := Yup. That would be Griff.
30203 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30204 := Translation: He says that the captive Jawas are slaves and that have lived past their usefulness. You may take them, if you wish.
30205 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30206 := Translation: He says that you already have a map to the Eastern Dune Sea, where we will find the Star Map.
30207 := Translation: He says that what you seek is far from here, in the Eastern Dune Sea. He will give you a map so you can find your way.
30208 := Translation: His people found it, but didn't scavenge it because a krayt dragon took up residence in the excavation.
30209 := Agreement: My thoughts exactly, master. One dead organic meatbag, coming up.
30210 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30211 := Translation: Your ignorance isn't his concern. He claims there is a hunter that wanders the area sometimes, and that you should ask him.
30212 := Translation: The hunter is a Twi'lek. He will be in the Eastern Dune Sea somewhere.
30213 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30214 := Translation: He says that he is not responsible for the failure of your eyes. The thing that you seek is in the rear of the krayt lair.
30215 := [Though you can't seem to understand him, the Sand People chieftain's tone is obvious. He clearly despises all outsiders.]
30216 := [His words are lost on you. Without HK-47 translating you have no hope of settling this situation peacefully. Sand People close around you.]
30217 := Translation: I can translate with some guarantee of accuracy that he is demanding to know why he should let us survive this encounter, master.
30218 := Extrapolation: I understand that you are Force Sensitive, master, but I lack sufficient knowledge to make an accurate assumption.
30219 := Hypothesis: Perhaps your ability does not take the place of actual language study when the subject is out of the ordinary.
30220 := Or perhaps the Sand People confuse your ability because they actively refuse to communicate with most outsiders. I have no data on this, sadly.
30221 := Protocol: While I enjoy the prospect, master, are you certain that is wise? He will not react favorably.
30222 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30223 := Translation: The results were predictable. He says we have tainted this place by being here and have insulted his leadership.
30224 := Translation: And something about your parentage and a grub worm, but he won't repeat it. Prepare for battle, master.
30225 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30226 := Translation: He claims he has no reason to believe you, master. Your kind have tainted this land with machines and uncaring ignorant feet.
30227 := Translation: He requires proof of good faith. We must make a contribution to his people that shows we are not a threat. Shall I blast him now, master?
30228 := Agreement: That is probably the most efficient course of action. This will be enjoyable.
30229 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30230 := Translation: He refuses to waste breath on you until you are proven to be an ally of his people. He seems quite adamant about it. Please let me blast him, master!
30231 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30232 := Translation: He plans to move his people farther from Anchorhead, but they need to build up stores of water first. He says you must aid him.
30233 := Translation: He wants moisture vaporators from the Czerka. If you deliver them, he will order that his people reduce their attacks on miners.
30234 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30235 := Translation: He says you will get no more answers until you have proven you are an ally of the Sand People.
30236 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30237 := Translation: He says that will never happen, master. Ignorant outsiders continually desecrate their most reverential customs. This will always demand a response... an attitude I can respect.
30238 := Protocol: From his perspective, a reduction is already a large step. It is doubtful you will get agreement on much more than that.
30239 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30240 := Translation: Hmph. He does not believe you, master. We will only be allowed to reenter the enclave when we have the vaporators with us.
30241 := Translation: We are to be escorted outside. He will wait, but he doesn't believe we are coming back.
30242 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30243 := Translation: He says that this offer is an outrage, master, and that his people have no use for outsider credits. Where would they spend it?
30244 := This has gone far enough. Attack him.
30245 := You have my orders! Attack him!
30246 := Tell him the deal is off unless the attacks stop.
30247 := Tell him that we have his vaporators.
30248 := I am tired of this. Attack him.
30249 := I have a few questions for him.
30250 := [Leave quietly]
30251 := I have questions for you, Chieftain.
30252 := Tell him farewell for now.
30253 := I want information on Sand People culture.
30254 := Why are they so hostile to outsiders?
30255 := What do you mean, "raise myself above" the land?
30256 := How does he have contact with the land while completely covered?
30257 := Never? Not even in death?
30258 := Tell him I apologize for previously unwrapping his warriors.
30259 := Just tell him. I want to see what happens.
30260 := Ask why he bargained for vaporators when they are "unnatural"?
30261 := Tell me the history of your clan.
30262 := Ask if we could meet this Storyteller.
30263 := How could I prove I am a worthy warrior?
30264 := What is a dragon pearl?
30265 := Where could I find a krayt dragon?
30266 := I've killed a krayt dragon. Does that prove my worth?
30267 := Here is a dragon pearl.
30268 := Ask about captives.
30269 := Let's go back to my other questions.
30270 := Ask if he knows about Mission's brother Griff.
30271 := Ask about getting Griff set free.
30272 := Ask if he knows about the Jawas Iziz told us about.
30273 := Ask about setting the captive Jawas free.
30274 := Ask about the Star Map.
30275 := I've no further use for him. Kill him.
30276 := A krayt dragon? What is that? How do I pass it?
30277 := I killed the dragon. I didn't see the Star Map.
30278 := Why are you able to speak with the Sand People when I can't?
30279 := Tell him to surrender or face death.
30280 := You have my orders. Do as I say!
30281 := Fine, ask if he's open to a peaceful solution.
30282 := Tell him we want a peaceful solution.
30283 := This has gone far enough. Attack him.
30284 := See if he's holding the Jawas Iziz was looking for.
30285 := Tell him that I have questions first.
30286 := Ask what it is that he wants.
30287 := Will he also tell us about any captives he has?
30288 := The attacks must stop altogether!
30289 := Tell him we will get his vaporators.
30290 := Offer him 100 credits to stop the attacks.
30291 := [This Sand People warrior has obviously recognized you, and is astounded that you are here. Your disguise may have allowed you to pass the turrets outside, but it is ineffective at close range.]
30292 := [This situation is hopeless without a very specialized translator. You are seen as nothing more than a trespasser that must be expelled.]
30293 := Interjection: One moment... I believe I understood that, master. It may not have been his intention, but he did actually communicate something.
30294 := Cautionary: I am unsure, master. Now is not the time for speculation, however. I will attempt to address your question later.
30295 := Agreement: That is probably the most efficient course of action.
30296 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30297 := Result: I believe I have succeeded in confusing him, master. We have shown an interest not common among outsiders.
30298 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30299 := Cautionary: Not the most productive of results, master. Your threat will be answered in the same manner, happily. Preparing blasters!
30300 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30301 := Translation: He is expressing disbelief... as am I... but his duty requires that he report to the Chieftain.
30302 := Extrapolation: It would seem that we are at least worthy of curiosity, for the moment. I would much rather this get bloody, master, but it is your call.
30303 := Why can you understand him but I can't?
30304 := Never mind that, get ready to fight!
30305 := Quickly, tell him we are not a threat!
30306 := Demand that his people stop attacking the miners!
30307 := Apologize for being here. Say we want peace.
30308 := [This Sand People warrior ignores you. It seems your presence here is a barely tolerated event.]
30309 := You're back! You've come to let old Griff out, right? Right? Uh... I don't want to beg, but I'm more than willing.
30310 := Because you know, I... I think Mission would really appreciate me being alive and not at all dead.
30311 := You can just keep waiting, Griff. We'll get you out of there when it suits us.
30312 := We used to be so close, sis. Now, I know we've had our differences, but I really need to get out of here now. No fooling.
30313 := Oh, you are such a... I'll see what we can do.
30314 := Uh... you there! I'm... I'm a high ranking executive of the Czerka Corporation! Eh... there's a big reward if you take me back to Anchorhead!
30315 := So, uh... you're here to save me, right? I'm sure you'll get... a huge reward! Yes indeed, Mission always said some people would pay to find me.
30316 := My name is Griff. You know her? Are you from Czerka Corporation? Please, tell me what's going on here!
30317 := I'm her brother! She's alive? I... I can't believe it! When I heard about Taris I thought the worst! Come on, take me to her! Get me out of here!
30318 := Hey, there's no call for that. If you know Mission like you say, you'll know she'd want me alive. I'm her dear brother.
30319 := What? No! This isn't right! No!
30320 := Hey now, I don't want him dead. Well, maybe I do, but couldn't we just let him sit here and think about things for a while?
30321 := Oh, I've been thinking about a lot of things! Honest! Come on now, let me go.
30322 := You big baby. We'll see... maybe.
30323 := What, no speeder escort? Okay, okay, I should just take what I can get. I sure would like to see Mission, though.
30324 := She's probably waiting for you on the ship you used to come to Tatooine, right? I think I'll go to the spaceport and see her. She'd like that.
30325 := Thanks again. Oh, and don't tell Mission I'm coming. I want it to be a surprise when I show up at the spaceport. I can't wait to see the look on her face.
30326 := Hey, come on now, you may as well be killing me. Get me out of here!
30327 := Yeah, you can just stay here!
30328 := What, we've only just met and everything is about you? What about me? Mission wouldn't want me trapped here waiting for Sand People to kill me.
30329 := Yeah, you do that. Mission would appreciate it. I know it. She loves me like a... well, a brother, I guess.
30330 := And you'd better appreciate it!
30331 := You know I do, Mission, you know I do. Honest this time.
30332 := We'd be risking everything just to get you out! That doesn't bother you?
30333 := You can't abandon me here. These Sand People, they're animals.
30334 := Yeah, you can find your way from there, right? Can you manage that? What? Is there something else?
30335 := Griff, don't you recognize me? It's Mission!
30336 := Mission? Is it really you? I heard Taris was destroyed! I thought you were dead! Joy of joys, my little sister is alive!
30337 := I... I have to ask you something, Griff. It's important. I ran into Lena. She said... she said it was your idea to leave me on Taris. It's not true, is it?
30338 := Ah, well... there's the truth and then there's the *truth*, you know? I always meant to go back to Taris, sis. Just as soon as I had the credits to pay off my debts. But credits have been hard to come by.
30339 := You mean it's true? It was your idea to leave me there? I'm your sister - how could you abandon me like that?
30340 := Come on, sis. You didn't need me to look after you anymore. You may have been young, but you knew how to take care of yourself. Besides, you're here now - everything worked out fine.
30341 := That's it? That's all you have to say to me after all these years after deserting me on Taris?
30342 := Well, that and uh... could you please get me out of here? You've got a tough looking friend there.
30343 := Uh... well, I... I wanted to thank you, and, uh, you look like you're doing well. Financially, I mean. Say... um... could you spare me a few credits to get back on my feet?
30344 := You... you're hitting me up for credits? I don't believe this! Lena was right about you, Griff! We should have just left you to the Sand People! Don't talk to me anymore - ever!
30345 := Huh... that didn't go well. Sis always was a little too fiery for her own good. She'll cool down in time.
30346 := Ha! You're kidding, right? Look at me... do I look like I've got any reward for you?
30347 := You may have saved my life, but I don't have a single credit to my name. Say, you wouldn't be able to spare me some credits? Just till I get back on my feet, you know?
30348 := Huh - I... uh... guess you've been talking to Lena, too. That's okay - I'll figure out a way to get by without your credits. I always do. Besides, I've already got a job lined up for me.
30349 := That's it, huh? Oh, figured you would be able to spare a bit more than that, but, you know, I'll take whatever I can get. Don't worry about me... I've already got a job waiting for me.
30350 := Greeta, the manager over at the Czerka supply shop, said I could come work for him if I ever get tired of the mines. I think I'll go take him up on his offer.
30351 := You know, maybe there's something else you can help me with. I need to talk to a guy first and set up the details, but if you're interested in a job come see me in Greeta's shop.
30352 := Goodbye, Mission. Uh... I'm glad you're not dead.
30353 := Hmph!
30354 := Ah, she'll be okay. We've had our fights before. Too bad, though. I could really have used a helping hand right now.
30355 := Explain yourself! How do you know Mission?
30356 := You know Mission? Who are you?
30357 := Mission travels with me. Why does that matter?
30358 := I know Mission. She's here on Tatooine with me.
30359 := Why shouldn't I just kill you? I've no interest in you.
30360 := I don't need the headache. You'll die here!
30361 := Run to Anchorhead. They're too busy fighting me to operate the turrets.
30362 := I'm not risking getting the Sand People mad. Stay here.
30363 := I can't just let you out. This whole place would turn on me.
30364 := I'll try to talk to the Sand People Chieftain.
30365 := Run to Anchorhead. They'll be too busy fighting me to operate the turrets.
30366 := The Sand People said you can go. Run to Anchorhead.
30367 := So, is there a reward for rescuing you?
30368 := Now what, Griff?
30369 := Forget it - you're nothing but a deadbeat!
30370 := Sorry, I don't have any credits to spare.
30371 := Here - take 50 credits.
30372 := Sure - here's 100 credits.
30373 := Don't be so sure.
30374 := We under Iziz will thank you for helping.
30375 := Your help will be fairly traded.
30376 := We are slaves here to the People of Sand.
30377 := We will thank you for helping.
30378 := [The Sand People Storyteller regards you as he did before; as an outsider. He is obviously used to being the most important figure in the tribe.]
30379 := Translation: The Storyteller waits for your questions, master.
30380 := [Compared to the warriors that you have encountered, the Sand People Storyteller is relatively calm in his movements and speech, but he still regards you coldly.] 
30381 := **pretend this character only appeared after giving dragon pearl to the chieftain.**
30382 := [You have no chance of understanding him without HK-47 present. He senses this and dismisses you, not wanting to waste his time.]
30383 := Translation: He identifies himself as the Storyteller, master. He has been told of your warrior skills and will speak the history to you.
30384 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30385 := Translation: He doesn't know what an outsider will gain. His people learn a sense of their importance in the world. Each generation must speak the tales of all the previous.
30386 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30387 := Translation: Theirs is an oral history, master, an active part of their lives. It is only permitted to relay the tales face to face.
30388 := Translation: A book or datapad can be taken away, cheapening the value of what it contains. To commit it to paper or storage is to remove it from the people.
30389 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30390 := Translation: We are free to leave.
30391 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30392 := Translation: He says that you dare not question the accuracy of his information. The stories are learned perfectly by each successive Storyteller.
30393 := Translation: In fact, they aren't allowed to speak the stories aloud unless they are exact. Any error is considered a blasphemy punishable by death.
30394 := Criticism: It seems inefficient to me, master. A score of apprentice Storytellers would be slaughtered each generation. What if the elder died before completing the teachings?
30395 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30396 := Translation: Apprentices are trained from birth. Very few speak the words in error. Storytellers are most often lost in battle between tribes.
30397 := Translation: Any tribe that loses its Storyteller is obviously unworthy of existing. They lose their connection to history and destroy themselves with infighting soon after. 
30398 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30399 := Translation: You may choose to hear the history, or you may choose not to. Their history is a single entity that cannot be partitioned.
30400 := Translation: The only exception is in continuing the tales once they have begun. If you leave, when you return he will continue from where he left off.
30401 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30402 := Translation: It begins with the ancient times. They were not Sand People, for there was no sand. The land was green with life, and they walked without wrappings.
30403 := Translation: Though the land was beautiful, they lived apart from the land. They built their walls high, and saw beyond the horizon. They dared to reach to the stars
30404 := Translation: There are no words for how long ago this was. It was before the outsiders, before the abduction, before the cities fell. Before the Builders.
30405 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30406 := Translation: His arrogant people touched the stars, and this sin drew the attention of the Builders. The Builders did not touch the stars; they lashed them to millstones.
30407 := Translation: Great demons of metal stripped the world of its riches, until all that was left was the green of the ground. The great cities were lifted away.
30408 := Translation: Those that had used the wealth were taken along with it; transgressors abducted to serve past the sky, seeding the stars with penitent, adaptable slaves.
30409 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30410 := Translation: There came a time when the Builders were also judged for their crimes. After generations, a plague weakened them, and the time of the great war began.
30411 := Translation: The Builders faltered, and his people realized why they had been punished: so that they understood the crime, and would now strike down the greater offender.
30412 := Translation: They worked chaos in the machines so they destroyed themselves. The Builders fought back, laying waste to the green that had been misused with fire from above.
30413 := Translation: Soil became glass, grinding to sand, but the fight was long-planned, and his people were safe. Deep in cave-homes carved from valley wall, they were free.
30414 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30415 := Editing: If I may, master, this section of his tale details several millennia of "the long walk," their nomadic wanderings as they accept their identity in a desert world.
30416 := Rather than strain my circuits on his dialect, might we just assume there was much fighting over who has the biggest bantha and move to more recent things?
30417 := Resignation: Very well, master, very well.
30418 := [Several hours later...]
30419 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30420 := Translation: The tribes spread far, distant from each other, but all as Sand People, and all cherished the land that remained. The sand would not be misused.
30421 := Translation: Then machines fell from the stars again. Outsiders, like you, that brazenly walked apart from the land. And greater still was the insult to come.
30422 := Translation: These outsiders reminded them of their past transgressions, of the time when they too walked apart from land. The outsiders - your kind - look like their ancient abducted.
30423 := Translation: So it is to the current suns, that the Sand People hate all outsiders and give them no footing. You come again, time after time, adaptable slaves to the machine.
30424 := Editing: The last thousand years are full of conflicts with different groups of attempted planetary settlers, all of whom are poorly described, long dead, and likely untraceable.
30425 := I believe I have truncated it down to the useable bits in what was already said. I hope it is enough, master.
30426 := Cautionary: I should warn you, master, that any questioning of their interpretation may be seen as trying to change the meaning of what was said.
30427 := Clarification: They may consider this to be "speaking the words in error," a blasphemy they would attempt to kill you for.
30428 := Obedient: I will ask whatever you wish, master.
30429 := Clarification: It would appear that they once had a thriving technologically advanced society, but were wiped out by a much more sophisticated alien species.
30430 := Doubting: I don't believe he can, master. Even if their stories are exact and unchanged, it is likely they were first told thousands of years after these events occured.
30431 := This has become very much like a creation myth for his people. There is no date; it simply was.
30432 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30433 := Translation: He only understands the Builders as an iconic force meant to test the resolve of his people. He is not making sense, master.
30434 := Clarification: They claim their stories are repeated unchanged, but they have demonized these Builders. In their minds, they wreaked such havok they could not possibly be flesh and blood.
30435 := Cautionary: Master, this line of questioning may be interpreted as attempting to change the story. He may react poorly.
30436 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30437 := Cautionary: As expected, he is claiming you have committed blasphemy. Warming blasters. Combat is inevitable.
30438 := Negative: I am no library, but since there is no Republic record of this planet having sentient life before Czerka colonization, I doubt you will find such evidence.
30439 := Clarification: I believe they were occupied by this technologically superior species for a substantial period. Stripping an entire planet of useable resources would have taken generations.
30440 := Obvious: The same reason Czerka Corporation is attempting it now. Expanding empires need tremendous amounts of resources.
30441 := Translation: [Unintelligible]
30442 := Translation: He has no number. He claims that those that were taken were examples of the worst of his kind, arrogant and uncaring of the land.
30443 := Doubtful: Master, this is just another distortion due to their demonization of the Builders. It's like claiming an aspect of his people were taken, not actual individuals.
30444 := Clearly history has colored his view. Of course only the inferior meat-bags were taken. The remaining were his ancestors after all, and must have been special.
30445 := Cautionary: Master, this line of questioning may be interpreted as attempting to change the story. He may react poorly.
30446 := Clarification: The occupying force suffered some sort of species-wide plague that lowered their numbers over time. His people used this extended weakness to sabotage their larger ships.
30447 := The response of the Builders appears to have been to lay waste to the entire surface of Tatooine.
30448 := Hypothesis: If his people were moving away from technology for a long time under the Builders, they may have had extensive cave systems that could grant shelter.
30449 := I would also suggest that, given the evidence of the massive shift in the nature of their society, most of them did not survive.
30450 := Clarification: I may not have properly conveyed how long they fought with the Builders. Given time, any number of armaments could destroy a world.
30451 := Hypothesis: Perhaps this is another distortion. Their climate may have begun to fail due to their unrestrained development even before the Builders arrived.
30452 := Looking back thousands of years later, such a shift could easily be attributed to the much-hated conquerors.
30453 := Cautionary: Master, this line of questioning may be interpreted as attempting to change the story. He may react poorly.
30454 := Doubting: They didn't, master. They struck a blow, but the Storyteller only believes they won because the Builders were gone when they emerged from their caves.
30455 := That does not mean they defeated anyone. It seems clear that the Builders simply sterilized their problem and left. The enemy judged them not worthy to fight.
30456 := Cautionary: Master, this line of questioning may be interpreted as attempting to change the story. He may react poorly.
30457 := Impatience: Master, I refuse to inconvenience you with this. He spouted names of petty tribal fights in deserts so distant they might as well be across the galaxy.
30458 := Really, master, I'm sure it's important to him, but it has nothing of value that you could ever put to use.
30459 := Agreement: Of course, master. Just no more of their inane wandering.
30460 := Clarification: They appear to hate humanity with a passion only rivaled by their hatred of the Builders. For some reason, you resemble what they once were.
30461 := Perhaps there is a lingering fear that you are their tainted selves returning from exile among the stars.
30462 := Cautionary: Master, if you mean to suggest that humanity is ancestrally linked to ancient Tatooine, you will strain his belief system to its pitiful meat-bag maximum.
30463 := Cautionary: Remember my warning, master. They may consider certain questions to be "speaking the words in error," a blasphemy they would attempt to kill you for.

30471 := Translation: There is only one accepted history, passed orally to each successive generation.
30472 := What good will these histories be to me?
30473 := He will speak it? They don't write it down?
30474 := I'll return later.
30475 := Oral histories are often inaccurate.
30476 := That's a good question. Ask him that.
30477 := What topics can I choose from?
30478 := Begin the history.
30479 := Continue with the history.
30480 := Continue with the history.
30481 := Continue with the history.
30482 := No, I want to hear it all.
30483 := If you can gently encourage that, go ahead.
30484 := Is there anything further?
30485 := I want to ask questions about what I've heard.
30486 := Let's return to my other questions.
30487 := I want to ask something about the ancient times.
30488 := I want to ask something about a different part of the history.
30489 := Can he clarify how long ago Tatooine was "green with life"?
30490 := Ask him if these "Builders" resemble any modern species.
30491 := Ask if they have an image we could compare with current species.
30492 := Just do it.
30493 := Is there anything in the galactic record that would verify this?
30494 := I want to ask something about the time of enslavement.
30495 := Why would the invaders have done this?
30496 := How many of his people were taken off-world?
30497 := Suggest that he rethink it.
30498 := I want to ask something about the great war.
30499 := How could they survive such an attack?
30500 := What kind of weapon could do so much damage?
30501 := Suggest that possibility to him.
30502 := How could they repel such a powerful species?
30503 := Ask him if that is a possibility.
30504 := I want to ask something about the long walk.
30505 := We'll have to discuss this impudence, HK-47.
30506 := I want to ask something about the outsiders.
30507 := Is it a physical or societal similarity?
30508 := Just pose the question.
30509 := Continue the history from where we left off.
30510 := Repeat the part about the outsiders.
30511 := Repeat the part about the long walk.
30512 := Repeat the part about the great war.
30513 := Repeat the part about the time of enslavement.
30514 := Repeat the fist part. The ancient times.
30515 := I am honored. Ask him what he records.

30542 := You understand these aliens? Of course... you must have come here and learned their languge in your search for the secrets of the Star Forge. Back when you were still Revan.
30543 := Wait a minute - do you understand these creatures? You must have learned their language when you came here in search of the secrets of the Star Forge. Back when you were still Revan.
30544 := Query: You are able to comprehend the speech patterns of these organics? You must have visited this planet and learned their language in your previous incarnation as Darth Revan.
30545 := Hold on a second - you understood these goggle-eyed freaks? You must have come to this planet and learned the language back before the Jedi messed up your mind. Back when you were still Revan.
30546 := Wait a minute - you understood these creatures? Of course... you and Malak must have been here before. You...you probably learned their language back when you were Revan.
30547 := You have used strange magics and weapons to slaughter our raiding parties, Interloper. You have bathed in the blood of fierce Rakatan warriors.
30548 := The will of the One cannot be denied, Interloper. You will come with us now to see our Champion, or our rancor war beasts will destroy you.
30549 := Release the war beasts!
30550 := A wise decision, Interloper. The One is eager to speak to you. Come - the journey is not long.
30551 := [Failure] You try to use your magic on us, Interloper? We are Rakata! You cannot bend us to your will like mindless beasts!
30552 := Anymore? That makes no sense. If you were Revan once, then you are still Revan. And since you are Revan you must be brought before the One.
30553 := The One is the leader of our tribe, the Great Champion of the Rakata. He has feasted on the flesh of many foes. Come with us and we will take you to him now.
30554 := You dare question me? I'm Darth Revan!
30555 := An invitation? What kind of invitation?
30556 := Rakata? The One? What are you talking about?
30557 := I'm not going anywhere with you.
30558 := I think I'll just kill you instead!
30559 := Okay. Take me to the One.
30560 := [Force Persuade] I don't have to come with you.
30561 := I'm not Revan anymore. I'm <FullName>.
30562 := Who is the One? What's going on here?
30563 := Hey, where are you going? We can't leave the planet yet. Remember all those wrecked ships we saw?
30564 := Until we get inside that temple and find some way to disable that disrupter field, the Ebon Hawk is grounded.
30565 := We need to salvage some new stabilizers or the Ebon Hawk won't even be able to get off the ground.
30566 := Whew! Talk about your rough landings, Carth! What's the matter? You're flying like you've been on an all night Tarisian ale drinking binge!
30567 := That disrupter field fried our stabilizers - we're lucky we made it down in one piece! If we can't find the salvage to make repairs I won't even be able to get the Ebon Hawk airborne again!
30568 := During our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Maybe the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.
30569 := The old man's right: this planet's a technological graveyard. I saw dozens of downed ships out there. That disrupter field must have wiped them all out. 
30570 := Even if we get the stabilizers fixed, we're gonna have to find and disable the source of that disrupter field before we can take off. Otherwise we'll just end up crashing again.
30571 := They must have some kind of protection against it. But the Republic fleet won't. And we're gonna have to find a way to disable that disrupter field or the Sith will slaughter them!
30572 := You're right! That Sith fleet we saw must have some type of protection against the disrupter field. We have to find a way to disable it or the Republic will be slaughtered!
30573 := Beep, boop, beep.
30574 := T3's picking up massive power fluctuations on the ship's sensors. They seem to be coming from some type of large stone structure to the east... it looks like some kind of ancient temple. 
30575 := Good idea. If that temple's generating power it probably has something to do with that disrupter field.
30576 := The stabilizers won't do much good if we don't disable that disrupter field first. Otherwise, we'll end up crashing back down to the planet's surface again. And this time we might not survive!
30577 := Hey, don't forget about Bastila, guys! We still have to rescue her, too.
30578 := We haven't forgotten about her. But we can't do her much good stuck down here. We have to help ourselves before we can help her.
30579 := I just hope we're not too late. Bastila's been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he turns her to the dark side she'll join him and the Sith will become invincible.
30580 := I only hope we're not too late. Bastila has been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he can turn her to the dark side she will join him and the Sith will be invincible.
30581 := I remember... though I hoped you would not be so quick to embrace the being you once were. If Bastila feels as you do then she is lost to us, Revan.
30582 := I fear Bastila will find the lure of the dark side difficult to resist. She is strong in the Force, but she is also impulsive, willful and proud - as you once were, Revan.
30583 := Let us hope it does not come to that.
30584 := Well, if Bastila is on the Star Forge like you think, Jolee, then we can't rescue her until we disable that disrupter field. The sooner we investigate that temple to the east the better.
30585 := We can probably find the wreckage of a downed ship along the way. And if we're lucky we can salvage some stabilizers from it to get off this planet.
30586 := I hope everything works out as smooth as you make it sound, Carth.
30587 := So do I, Mission. So do I.
30588 := I am glad to hear you say that. Now that you know your true identity I was afraid you might slip back over to the dark side. If Bastila feels as you do there may yet be hope for her.
30589 := You know, during our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Perhaps the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.
30590 := The Cathar's right: this planet's a technological graveyard. I saw dozens of downed ships out there. That disrupter field must have wiped them all out. But where could it be coming from?
30591 := Bastila - you're alive! I was worried about you. For a minute there I was sure we'd never see you again once Malak got his... w... wait a minute.
30592 := Where's Jolee Bindo? Is he okay? What happened inside that temple?
30593 := Where are Juhani and Jolee Bindo? Are they okay? What happened inside that temple?
30594 := What... what are you talking about?
30595 := The Jedi Council has failed, Carth - Darth Revan has been reborn! Together we will destroy Malak and seize control of his fleet, then use it to crush the Republic!
30596 := Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. He died for his foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!
30597 := Juhani and Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. They died for their foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!
30598 := Wh... what? No! We serve the Republic! You're no better than Malak! We'll never swear allegiance to one who serves the dark side!
30599 := Wait, Lord Revan. Carth speaks only for himself - he does not speak for the others. He may find he stands alone here!
30600 := The droids will continue to serve you Revan - they are programmed to obey their master. And there may be others who will choose to join us. 
30601 := The Republic is doomed, Revan has returned! Who will now swear loyalty to the second coming of the Dark Lord?
30602 := You're Revan and I'll follow you anywhere. It doesn't matter who you're fighting against, I'll be at your side. Mandalorians don't have any great love for the Republic anyway.
30603 := Light side, dark side - it doesn't make any difference to me, Revan. I'll stick by you no matter what comes.
30604 := I saw what the Sith did to Taris - anyone who serves the dark side is evil! Big Z and I are with Carth on this one!
30605 := No, Mission. I am bound by the oath of my life debt. I... I must stand with Revan. 
30606 := Zaalbar - Revan's a Sith! Just like Malak! It's not a betrayal if you break your life debt now!
30607 := If I go back on my vow I am betraying myself, my people and my ancestors. I cannot do that. Please, Mission - join us.
30608 := No, Zaalbar. I don't care! I won't help the Sith against the Republic! Not for anything! Not even for you!
30609 := You don't have to help the Sith, Mission. Not while I'm here.
30610 := I see now it was a mistake to let you go into that Temple. I of all people should have seen this coming. First Saul Karath, and now you... I mean, I should be an expert on betrayal by now!
30611 := But nothing you can say or do can make me betray the Republic. I won't join you, and I won't just stand aside and let you become ruler of the Sith again, Revan!
30612 := Run for it, Mission! Go! Go!
30613 := No, Carth! Don't do it!
30614 := I... I'll find a way to save you, I swear! I won't give up on you... no matter what!
30615 := Run for it, Mission! Go! Go!
30616 := Let him go! We have more important things to worry about. We have to get to the Star Forge and kill Malak. Then we can turn our attention to the Republic.
30617 := No, you can't mean that! This... this isn't you! You're not Revan, I know it!
30618 := You've got to resist it! Th... this isn't you talking... we... we can help you, we can find a way --
30619 := My, my. I think the sad fool may actually be in love with you, Revan.
30620 := I refuse to believe that! We'll...we'll stop you if we have to, all of us. We'll save you from yourselves!
30621 := No, never! You're not the woman I love. We'll stop you if we have to, all of us.
30622 := You're back! But where's Bastila? Is she alive? What happened inside that Temple?
30623 := Hold on a second! What about Bastila? Wasn't she in the Temple? Wh...what happened?
30624 := Dead? I... I can't believe it.
30625 := She's not dead, Carth - though that might have been easier for you to accept. She's fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.
30626 := She is not dead, Carth - though maybe that might have been easier for you to accept. She has fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.
30627 := The dark side? Bastila? No! No! How could that happen?
30628 := She was always in danger of being seduced by the dark side, Carth. Bastila was strong, but she was always impatient and headstrong. Malak preyed upon her weaknesses.
30629 := This planet is a tainted place, the Star Forge and the Temple have twisted the Force into an instrument of evil - just as Malak has twisted Bastila into a servant of the Sith. 
30630 := Weakness has nothing to do with the corruption of the dark side. A Jedi must always guard against pride and the desire for power. Especially you.
30631 := In the end we all choose our own path, but keep in mind the role that you played in her downfall. You and the task assigned to her by the Jedi Council.
30632 := Remember the bond that was forged between you when she rekindled the spark that was your life. Through that bond she touched your memories... and also the echo of the dark taint within you.
30633 := But there's still hope for her, right? I mean, Revan rejected the dark side so Bastila could too, right? We still might be able to save her.
30634 := I'm not sure what's in store for us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play. I have no doubt she'll be waiting for us on the Star Forge.
30635 := I don't know what fate awaits us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play in the events to come. I have no doubt she will be waiting for us on the Star Forge.
30636 := No doubt. Let's go, then, before she has time to organize a bigger welcoming committee.
30637 := No doubt. I must say that it's good to have you with us, my dear. For a minute there I thought you might decide... well, never mind what I thought.
30638 := Decide? Decide what?
30639 := Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.
30640 := Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.
30641 := So... you did it? You turned against Revan once and for all? I knew she wasn't part of you anymore. I...I knew it.
30642 := I told you that you would have to make a choice eventually, that you would be tested. I think that was it, I...I can feel it.
30643 := And you did exactly what I'd hoped you would. It couldn't have been easy... I'm...I'm very proud of you.
30644 := Always. I'm not certain any one of us wouldn't have been tempted by Bastila's offer.
30645 := I... I love you. And I...I can't wait until all of this is over with.
30646 := Right. Sorry. I just... can't remember the last time I felt this happy. I can wait until the Star Forge is destroyed.
30647 := You make that sound so easy. Just fly over and boom, one less Star Forge in the universe, huh?
30648 := I feel more confident now than I ever did before. The Force is with us, Mission.
30649 := Well, I'm an old man and I know you should take love when you can find it. Good for you two, I say.
30650 := Beep! Beep-beep boop!!
30651 := Answer: I have no idea what they speak of, droid. Organic meatbags are an eternal mystery to me.
30652 := Confidence is all well and good, Carth, but if we are going to catch up to Bastila we should leave soon, don't you think?
30653 := Okay - let's get moving. The longer we wait the harder this is going to be!
30654 := Hey! Sheesh... get a room, will ya?
30655 := That two spirits have found each other amidst such turmoil is a good omen, Mission. Does it not please you to see?
30656 := Oh, sure. Even a good omen can get itself a room, though, don't ya think?
30657 := I know. I can't blame Bastila for being turned, however... she's...she's just so young and doesn't deserve this kind of fate.
30658 := I'm sure she did. I can't say that any one of us wouldn't have been tempted.
30659 := Malak has a strong hold on Bastila now - it will be difficult for her to break free of his influence. Especially considering her long association with you.
30660 := I wonder why the Sith ships aren't affected by the disrupter field?
30661 := That disrupter field could wipe out the entire Republic fleet!
30662 := Let's go check it out.
30663 := Hey - I thought we needed to find some stabilizers for the ship!
30664 := You all seem to be forgetting about Bastila!
30665 := Even together they are no match for me. I used to be the Sith Lord, remember?
30666 := Bastila would never turn to the dark side!
30667 := If Bastila's joined Malak then she'll suffer the same fate he does!
30668 := Don't call me that. I'm not Revan anymore.
30669 := He didn't make it.
30670 := I went over to the dark side, Carth. That's what happened.
30671 := They didn't make it.
30672 := I have reclaimed the title of Darth Revan! Bow before me!
30673 := I guess I'll just have to kill you all, then.
30674 := Not everyone is as foolish as you are, Carth!
30675 := Not everyone is willing to throw their life away for the Republic, Carth!
30676 := Zaalbar, what about you?
30677 := Mission, what about you?
30678 := It's too bad it had to come to this, Carth.
30679 := Then I guess it's time for you to die!
30680 := You don't stand a chance against all of us, Carth.
30681 := Only you serve the Republic, Carth. You don't speak for the others.
30682 := If you resist me, I'll destroy you all!
30683 := Don't be a blind fool, Carth. Open your eyes.
30684 := How sad. I guess there's no future for us after all, is there?
30685 := All of you? Are you sure of that?
30686 := Don't resist me, Carth, or I'll be forced to destroy you.
30687 := Join me, Carth. You can rule at my side, it's not too late.
30688 := This is my choice, Carth, whether you like it or not.
30689 := Does it matter who I am? I have joined the dark side.
30690 := I am Revan, Carth. Now and forever.
30691 := No time! We have to get off this planet and get to the Star Forge!
30692 := Bastila is dead, Carth. Malak killed her.
30693 := Bastila has fallen to the dark side. She fled to the Star Forge.
30694 := Bastila is lost to us now. She deserves to die.
30695 := Malak corrupted Bastila because she was weak.
30696 := I can't help but feel this is partly my fault.
30697 := It's too late for her. Just accept it.
30698 := It took the whole Jedi Council and a mind wipe to save me. What chance does she have?
30699 := We can try... and we will.
30700 := Once and for all? What are you talking about?
30701 := Thank you. I appreciate the support.
30702 := We've got a long way to go yet, Carth.
30703 := Hey, cool your engines there.
30704 := I love you, too.
30705 := I could never do what Bastila did.
30706 := It wasn't easy at all. Bastila made a good case.
30707 := I chose the light side. It's true.
30708 := Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Anything can still happen.
30709 := She can still be saved, can't she?
30710 := No - this isn't happening! It can't be happening!
30711 := I don't believe you've gone over to the dark side. Not totally. I don't think you'll kill me. Not if I don't attack you, first.
30712 := I have sworn a life debt to you, Revan. I will serve you as long as I draw breath. I will not break my vow. But you cannot ask me to turn on my best friend.
30713 := Looks like you'll have to do your own dirty work, Revan - if you've got the guts!
30714 := No... please. Don't make me do this! I will not break my vow, but I'm begging you - don't force me to do this!
30715 := Zaalbar, what are you saying? Revan can't force you to do anything you don't want to! It's me, Big Z - Mission!
30716 := [Success] I... I have no choice. The life debt is greater than any single life, it is a solemn vow of all my people. I cannot break it, not even for you. Forgive me, Mission.
30717 := Please, Zaalbar - don't do this! Please! NO!!!
30718 := Mission, forgive me!!!
30719 := Well done, Lord Revan. You are as ruthless as Malak ever was! Quickly, now. We have to get to the Star Forge and destroy the Usurper!
30720 := NO! I won't let this happen!
30721 := No! I'm not going to just stand aside and do nothing! You'll... you'll just have to kill me. But I don't think you will.
30722 := Now it's time for you to die, Mission.
30723 := I won't kill you. But Zaalbar will, if I tell him to.
30724 := [Force Persuade] You swore a life debt to me, Zaalbar! You'll do as I say!
30725 := Do it, Zaalbar! Prove your loyalty to me! Kill her!
30726 := Fine - I'll just kill you myself.
30727 := You're wrong Mission - I'm the Dark Lord now! Taste my wrath!
30728 := You should have run when you had the chance, Mission.
30729 := Go on, Mission - get out of here. We don't want you anymore.
30730 := You're all alone now, Mission. Swear your loyalty to me!

30768 := The Elders will have many questions for you, Revan. They will want to know why you have returned.
30769 := Revan, we... we do not understand! Why are you threatening us? The Elders helped you the last time you were here, and this is how you repay us?
30770 := The Black Rakata? They are nothing but barbarians and savages. What could they possibly help you with? If you need help you should speak with the Elders.
30771 := You... you do not remember the Elders? This... this is very strange. You should come with us to our village, Revan, and speak with the Elders. This is a matter for them.
30772 := Defend yourselves - we are under attack!
30773 := Come, the village is not far.
30774 := I've only returned to destroy you all!
30775 := Enough talk. Now you die!
30776 := I have to kill you to gain the help of the Black Rakata.
30777 := The Elders? What are you talking about?

30799 := You are the ones who will be destroyed! Death to the Black Rakata!

30812 := Wait... someone is coming!
30813 := Wait... you can't go in there alone!
30814 := I had a... a premonition. A vision through the Force. There's great danger inside that Temple. I can't let you face it alone.
30815 := We have had a... a premonition. The Force has given us a vision. There is great danger within the Temple. We cannot let you face it alone.
30816 := You might be walking into a trap... maybe Malak himself is waiting inside. Even if he isn't, that temple will be crawling with Dark Jedi. You'll need all the help you can get.
30817 := No other can go with you into the Temple. You must enter alone. That is the way of the ancient ritual.
30818 := Your destiny - maybe the fate of the entire galaxy - could be forever changed inside that Temple. I'm not about to let you face that alone. Not after my premonition. There's a reason I had that vision.
30819 := So you just tell that guide of yours to do whatever he has to do to get us all inside the Temple.
30820 := No! You must enter the Temple alone! I will not lower the shields!
30821 := I don't know what he said, but it sounds like your guide's being stubborn. We don't have time for this.
30822 := The Republic fleet is on the way and we're stuck on this planet until we deactivate that disruptor field. You have to convince him to get us inside that Temple!
30823 := No... do not hurt me! I... I will do as you command. I will begin the ritual.
30824 := Not exactly the way I would have handled it, but given the circumstances it'll do.
30825 := [Success] I... I believe you. The Elders have said you wish to destroy the Star Forge and end the terrible legacy of our ancestors. If you need help to do this, I will not stand in your way.
30826 := [Success] You... you are right! These are the rituals of the priest caste. The Elders are no more, now the Rakata control the secrets of the Temple!
30827 := The laws of the Temple die with the Elders who made them! I will perform the ritual and allow you to enter the Temple.
30828 := I will resume the ritual now.
30829 := Why do I get the feeling this is going to take a while? Still, we better stay ready. As soon as those shields go down we have to get inside the temple.
30830 := Jolee speaks for both of us. You must enter the Temple, but we must go with you.
30831 := The ancient traditions state that you must enter the Temple alone. I will not perform the ritual if there are others with you.
30832 := I have to go in there alone. It's the Rakata tradition.
30833 := What are you doing here?
30834 := Jolee - you can't come! The Rakata won't allow it.
30835 := Continue the ritual.
30836 := I'm not going in alone after all. Lower the shields.
30837 := Lower that shield or I'm going to cut you into little pieces!
30838 := [Persuade] I cannot destroy the Star Forge alone. They must come with me into the Temple.
30839 := [Persuade] These rituals are those of the Elders. They mean nothing to you!
30840 := [There is a powerful energy shield that prevents you from passing.]

30861 := Searching... retrieving information...
30862 := The Temple is a sacred place of ancient secrets. All the dark mysteries of the Rakata are housed within its stone walls, which pulse with the living power of the Ancients.
30863 := Only those who can command the Force can enter the Temple. None among the Rakata still have this ability, though the Elders are seeking to breed a Force sensitive being.
30864 := Countless centuries of living in the shadow of the Star Forge has stripped this power from them. The Rakata can lower the shields around the Temple, but they cannot enter.
30865 := Constructed during the height of the Infinite Empire's glory, the Star Forge is an enormous space station orbiting the Rakata home world.
30866 := The production capabilites of the factories located within the Star Forge allowed the Rakata to churn out massive fleets to crush all opposition to their rule.
30867 := Further details on the Star Forge and its capabilities are restricted to the main archives located within the Temple of the Ancients.
30868 := Searching... retrieving information...
30869 := The Elders are descended from the Rakata priest caste. When the Infinite Empire collapsed, the Elders isolated themselves on this island, far away from the rest of Rakata society.
30870 := The Elders hid the secret technology of the Ancients within the Temple, fearing it could be used to bring about the extinction of the Rakata species.
30871 := Deprived of the knowledge of the Ancients, the other Rakata degenerated into primitive tribes engaged in constant warfare. Only the Elders have preserved the true history of this world.
30872 := Searching... retrieving information...
30873 := At its peak the Infinite Empire of the Rakata ruled over 500 planets and was comprised of ten billion Rakata and over a trillion slaves scattered across the galaxy.
30874 := But over time the Empire grew weak and corrupt, and turned against itself. Civil war, slave rebellions and a great plague spread throughout the galaxy.
30875 := Worlds were ravaged and millions of lives were lost. Sensing the weakness of their oppressors, the slaves rebelled and overthrew their masters. And then came the plague. 
30876 := Its origins were unknown - perhaps the creation of an enslaved species, perhaps a mutation of a natural virus. It killed only Rakata, and it spread to every corner of the galaxy.
30877 := The Infinite Empire crumbled into dust as the Rakata survivors fled back here to their home world, isolated and hidden from the rest of the galaxy.
30878 := But even hidden here on this forgotten planet they were not safe. Millions died from the deadly plague, many more died in the never ending civil war.
30879 := The history of the Infinite Empire ended twenty thousand years ago. Now the Rakata are nothing but a few scattered, primitive tribes battling for dominance and control.
30880 := Searching... retrieving information...
30881 := These secrets are locked within the Temple of the Ancients. The Elders sealed this information away to prevent the technology from falling into the wrong hands.
30882 := Searching... retrieving information...
30883 := The shields constructed by the Elders to guard the Temple are controlled from the summit of the structure. Anyone inside the Temple may temporarily shut down the shields.
30884 := To protect the secrets within the Temple, the chant will only work if spoken by the Rakata; no other species can create the proper intonations that will trigger shield deactivation.
30885 := I'll be going now.
30886 := [Persuade] I do serve the Rakata. How else would I learn the language?
30887 := How can I shut off the disruptor field around this planet?
30888 := Tell me about the Temple of the Ancients.
30889 := So the Star Forge drains them of their ability to use the Force?
30890 := Tell me about the Star Forge.
30891 := Search for more information on the Star Forge.
30892 := So the Star Forge is some kind of factory?
30893 := Tell me about the Elders.
30894 := I want to know about the history of the Rakata.
30895 := A plague?
30896 := I am looking for the secrets of the Ancient Rakata.
30897 := How can I get into the Temple?
30898 := I want to ask you something else.
30899 := Our scouts report that the One is dead and the Black Rakata are routed. We are safe... for now. You have proven yourself to us with your actions, Revan.
30900 := For our own sake, and that of the entire galaxy, we hope you truly mean to atone for your past evils. When you are ready, Revan, we will take you to the Temple.
30901 := But the temple is a place of sacred power. If you are to enter you must do so alone, in the tradition followed by our Rakata ancestors for the past thousand generations.
30902 := When you were last here we broke the ancient tradition. We allowed you and your apprentice to enter the Temple together, and it brought untold suffering upon the galaxy.
30903 := We believe you truly wish to destroy the Star Forge this time. But the lesson of the past is not easily forgotten. We will not defile the sacred ritual a second time; only you alone may enter.
30904 := You have the power to enter the Temple itself, but you cannot lower the energy shields around it. Only the Rakata can invoke the ritual chant with the proper intonation.
30905 := Then it is done. You have only to let us know when you are ready to enter the Temple.
30906 := You have returned, Revan. Are you ready to enter the Temple now?
30907 := As you wish. Come speak to us when you are ready to enter the Temple and we will lower the shield for you.
30908 := But remember: when the time comes you must enter the Temple alone, in accordance with the traditions of the ancient Rakata. 
30909 := Go to the Temple now. We will meet you there once the ritual has been prepared. Remember: in accordance with ancient Rakata tradition you must enter the Temple alone.
30910 := You return, yet the Black Rakata tribe still live. Why are you here? We will not help you until the One is destroyed.
30911 := We wish it could be otherwise, but the Black Rakata cannot be reasoned with. We will not be safe until the One is dead. Return when the deed is done and we will take you inside the Temple.
30912 := We will tell you what we can, Revan.
30913 := The disruptor field is one of the ancient defenses of the Star Forge; a great generator within the Temple of the Ancients fuels it. You will have to enter the Temple to disable it.
30914 := The Star Forge was built during the height of the Infinite Empire; a symbol of our power and ruthlessness. More than this we cannot say, as we told you when you last came here.
30915 := The secrets of the Star Forge - what it is and what it does - are locked away in the Temple of the Ancients. We feared they would lead us down the path of destruction our ancestors followed.
30916 := When you and Malak entered the Temple you unlocked those secrets and activated the Star Forge. And once again the terrible engine of war was unleashed upon the galaxy.
30917 := The Temple is a sacred place, but also a place of great danger. Within its walls the terrible secrets of our ancestors have been locked away.
30918 := Only those who can command this power - what you call the Force - can enter the Temple. Many centuries ago there were still a few among us who could pass within its walls.
30919 := But living in the shadow of the Star Forge we became desensitized to this power. As you yourself said the last time you were here, the Rakata are no longer 'Force sensitive'.
30920 := None of the Black Rakata command the power of the Ancients, yet they are determined to break in and reclaim the forbidden knowledge.
30921 := That was why we created the energy shield around the building as a second line of defense. But the energy shield was created using technology within the Temple itself.
30922 := Once we helped you and Malak to get past the barrier, you discovered a way to lower the shields at will from within the Temple itself. After this you had no further need of either Rakata tribe.
30923 := The once hallowed ground of the Temple is now overrun with the followers of Malak who command the power of the Ancients: those you call the Dark Jedi.
30924 := We are the Elders. Our ancestors were the priests of the Infinite Empire, the guardians of the Temple and the keepers of technology. 
30925 := After the Warlords unleashed their weapons of mass destruction and devastated the world, our ancestors knew we could never allow such techonolgy to be used again.
30926 := We sealed the knowledge of destruction within the Temple, and for the past thousand generations we have kept vigil here, ensuring the knowledge does not fall into the wrong hands. 
30927 := There is only one other group of Rakata on this island, the tribe of the One. They would slaughter us if they could, hoping to unlock the secrets hidden away in the Temple.
30928 := Our history is a long one, but it is also one filled with bloodshed and sorrow. Once the Rakata ruled all the known galaxy, but our Empire was destroyed by our own corruption.
30929 := Our ancestors rose to power by conquering and enslaving the other species of the galaxy. The Infinite Empire was built on war and slaughter; it was inevitable it should collapse upon itself.
30930 := We were a cruel and ruthless people, always seeking to gain at the expense of others, even our own kind. Conflict among power-hungry warlords escalated into full civil war.
30931 := Worlds were ravaged and millions of lives were lost. Sensing the weakness of their opressors, the slaves rebelled and overthrew their masters. And then came the plague. 
30932 := The plague was a great scourge spawned to destroy the unholy evil of the Infinite Empire. It killed only Rakata, and it spread to every corner of the galaxy.
30933 := The Infinite Empire crumbled into dust as the few Rakata survivors fled back here to our home world. All evidence of our existence was destroyed by the species we once enslaved.
30934 := But even hidden here on our secret home world we were not safe. Millions died from the deadly plague, many more died in the never ending civil war.
30935 := Now our great Empire is nothing but a few scattered tribes descended from the priest and warrior castes, still waging our never ending civil war.
30936 := Is this some type of test, Revan? Some type of trick? You came seeking our aid; you came in search of a way to enter the Temple of the Ancients. 
30937 := You claimed to be seeking a way to destroy the Star Forge, and we were foolish enough to believe you. Unaware of your true nature, we helped you enter the Temple.
30938 := But you betrayed us, Revan. Instead of destroying the terrible legacy of our ancestors you unleashed the evil of the Star Forge upon an unsuspecting galaxy.
30939 := And now you stand before the Council of Elders once more. And once more we ask you: for what reason have you returned, Revan?
30940 := Guards! Guards! We are under attack!
30941 := Do you think we are fools, Revan? Do you think we have forgotten how you lied to us last time? Why should we believe you now?
30942 := They say that the experiences of our past define us and make us what we are. If it is true you have lost your memories, then perhaps you are changed. But how are we to know this is not some trick, Revan?
30943 := At last you reveal your true self! Guards: destroy the evil in our midst!
30944 := [Failure] You say you are not who you once were, yet here on our world you repeat the pattern of your last visit.
30945 := Like the last time, you have crashed here. Like last time, you have come seeking our help. How have you changed, Revan?
30946 := [Success] We sense you mean the words you speak. But words are easy to say; it is actions that prove the true nature of your character.
30947 := We must discuss this in greater detail. We must have some privacy, Revan. We will return when our deliberations are done.
30948 := We have the strength to resist most of the Black Rakata, but the tribe of the One is particularly strong. We have tried to negotiate peace, but they will not rest until they slaughter us all.
30949 := You must slay the One for us. Risk your own life to save ours and your actions will prove you have changed. Only then will we let you into the temple.
30950 := No, you are not. But if you have truly changed you will humble yourself to our will. You will risk your own life to save ours. Killing the One is the only way to prove you have changed.
30951 := If you attack the Black Rakata village you will need these grenades. They emit a gas that is poisonous to the war beasts of the Black Rakata, but will not harm other creatures.
30952 := Once you slay the One we will help you enter the Temple, but not before.
30953 := [Failure] Again, you are only repeating the patterns from before. You know we hold the secret of entering the Temple. That is why you do not attack us.
30954 := You come in the guise of a friend, but how do we know you are not going to betray us again?
30955 := I'm not going into the Temple without help!
30956 := Forget it! I'll find my own way into the Temple.
30957 := Okay, when I'm ready I'll go into the Temple alone.
30958 := When I am ready, I will go into the Temple alone.
30959 := Why do I have to go in alone?
30960 := I'm not ready yet.
30961 := I want to enter the Temple now.
30962 := I'll be back when I'm ready to enter the Temple.
30963 := I want to ask you some questions.
30964 := I'll be going now.
30965 := I'll be back after I kill the Black Rakatans!
30966 := Do you know how to disable the disruptor field that caused my ship to crash?
30967 := Can you tell me about the Star Forge?
30968 := What do you know about the Temple of the Ancients?
30969 := So why is there an energy field outside the Temple then?
30970 := Can the Black Rakata enter the Temple?
30971 := Tell me about your tribe.
30972 := I want to learn more about the history of the Rakata Empire.
30973 := I want to ask you about something else.
30974 := The plague?
30975 := The Black Rakata have sent me here to destroy you. Time to die!
30976 := I'm sorry. I have no memory of our last meeting.
30977 := Uh... I need to get into the Temple so I can destroy the Star Forge.
30978 := I see this is going nowhere. I'll just kill you instead!
30979 := My mind was destroyed, all my memories were lost. It changed me. I am not who I once was.
30980 := Enough of this - I am the Dark Lord reborn! Bow before me!
30981 := [Persuade/Lie] I regret the mistakes of my past. I want to make amends.
30982 := [Persuade] The part of me that was Revan is dead. Now I am <FullName>.
30983 := [Persuade] I am a servant of the light now. I want to make amends for the mistakes of the past.
30984 := [Persuade] I cannot prove what is in my heart. I only ask you judge me by my actions.
30985 := How am I supposed to get past their rancor war beasts?
30986 := I'm not your servant!
30987 := If it will get me inside the Temple, I'll destroy the One and the Black Rakata for you.
30988 := [Persuade] The One wanted me to kill you, but I have come here peacefully.

31009 := I bow before you, Darth Revan, for you are the true Lord of the Sith.
31010 := Hail, Lord Revan! The One has prophesized that you will lead the Rakata back to the ancient glory of our ancestors.
31011 := All hail Darth Revan, the Sith Lord reborn! Death to Malak the Usurper!
31012 := My scouts have reported a great battle in the compound of the Elders. Tell me, Revan - in your slaughter did you find the book recording the great secrets of the past?
31013 := Well done, Revan. But before I will consider your oath fulfilled, I must study this tome. I must see if it truly contains the ancient knowledge I seek.
31014 := I will have the guards escort you back here once we have studied the contents of the manuscript you have brought us.
31015 := I have studied this tome, Revan. Much of it is beyond me, it speaks often of 'technology' - a form of magic I do not comprehend. But one thing has become clear to me: 
31016 := All is not lost, Revan. After studying this book I have come to understand that even the Elders themselves did not actually possess the ancient secrets. They were only the guardians.
31017 := I now have the rituals to lower the shields, but the Temple is guarded by yet another barrier. Only those with powerful magic - what you call the Force - can pass through the entrance.
31018 := Why should we help you to enter where we ourselves can never go? No, you should return to your vessel and leave this planet now.
31019 := [Success] You did fulfill your vow and destroy the Red Rakata. And there are none among our tribe who can enter the Temple - you are the only one who can bring the secrets out to us.
31020 := If you fail to return, I will have lost nothing: I still have the knowledge gained from the Red Rakata computer. But if you return, I have much to gain.
31021 := Yes. You brought this tome to me as you promised. Now I must trust you again. We will help you enter the Temple, and in exchange you will bring forth the great secrets within.
31022 := The Temple is a sacred place to the Rakata, its power is bound in ritual and tradition. I have studied the ritual closely.
31023 := It is forbidden for more than one to enter the Temple at a time. This is one of the sacred traditions of our ancestors; I will not permit you to defile it.
31024 := You have the power to enter the Temple itself, but you cannot lower the energy shields the Elders built around it. Only a Rakata can invoke the ritual chant with the proper intonation.
31025 := If you are ready to enter the Temple, we can begin the ritual immediately.
31026 := Yes, there is that. Your presence on this world could cause complications. You command the power of the Ancients, there are those among the Rakata who might follow you.
31027 := Now that I have the technological knowledge of the Red Rakata you are one of the few who might stand against my tribe. Perhaps it would be best if I were to help you leave this world.
31028 := The datapad does make mention of the disruptor field, but it can only be disabled from within the Temple of the Ancients.
31029 := You have returned. Do you wish to enter the temple now?
31030 := As you wish. Come speak to me and when you are ready to enter the Temple and I will have my priests perform the ritual.
31031 := But remember: when the time comes you must enter the Temple alone, in accordance with the traditions of the ancient Rakata. 
31032 := Remember: in accordance with ancient Rakata tradition you must enter the Temple alone. My priests will meet you at the shield's edge to perform the ritual.
31033 := Revan. Somehow I knew we would meet again. Even when you vanished, I knew you would not forget the vow you swore to me.
31034 := And when my scouts told me of a great warrior from the sky slaughtering our raiding parties with mysterious powers and magics, I knew you had at last returned!
31035 := The power of the Ancients cannot twist my mind, Revan! I am Rakata, not one of the weak-willed slave species! Tell me why our enemy still lives or our rancor war beasts will destroy you!
31036 := [Failure] No, Revan! We trusted you last time and you betrayed us! Why, Revan? Explain yourself: why does our enemy still live?
31037 := Your words are confusing. I recognize you: you are the one called Revan. You are the one who came here before; you and Malak, the one who served you.
31038 := You promised to slay our enemy. In exchange for our aid you swore to destroy the Elders and bring us their secrets. Are you saying this means nothing to you now?
31039 := I believe you, Revan. I sense there is something different about you. Something that has changed. You are not the same as you were before.
31040 := Yet the power of magic - what you call the Force - is within you still. You can still destroy the Elders and fulfill your vow!
31041 := But in exchange for your life you must fulfill the oath you swore to us before. You must slay the Red Rakatan tribe.
31042 := Force you? No, Revan - we were allies working to a common goal! It was you who suggested we forge our alliance.
31043 := I suppose that if what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Very well, Revan.
31044 := I will help you to understand. And then you will destroy the Elders tribe and fulfill the oath you swore to us long ago.
31045 := Yes, I suppose that is true. I will start at the beginning, with our first meeting.
31046 := You arrived with Malak - your servant - three of your galactic standard years ago. My scouts saw your sky ship plummet to the earth and they went to loot the crash site.
31047 := They tried to take you prisoner, but you unleashed your magic - what you called the Force - upon them. Seeing your power they bowed before you and brought you here to me.
31048 := You used your power to rip the Rakata language from my mind, even as you drove Basic into our skulls so we could help you in your quest to find something called the 'Star Forge'.
31049 := But the answers you sought lay within the Temple of the Ancients, and we could not help you enter the Temple. The Elders alone hold its secrets, guarding them with their very lives.
31050 := [Success] I see you that you have changed much since our last meeting. I am confident you will not betray us this time.
31051 := The compound of the Elders is to the south, beyond the Temple of the Ancients. From torturing the few Elders we have captured, we know something of what lies beyond the gates.
31052 := The Elders are few in number. If you can get past the exterior defenses, you could surely slaughter them all. Then you can bring us back the knowledge they guard.
31053 := There was one prisoner, an Elder who's mind broke beneath our tortures. He raved of ancient rituals, of lost power and forgotten secrets! Unfortunately, most of his dying screams made no sense.
31054 := Yet in his last hours he spoke of a book; an ancient tome that recorded the most powerful knowledge of the Elders, and detailed the rituals that could unleash the secrets.
31055 := That I cannot help you with. Although we have recovered many strange devices from the sky ships that crash to the earth, their use is a mystery to us.
31056 := The Elders guard the ancient secrets. Within their compound is the knowledge of power and magic; including the knowledge of how to enter the Temple itself.
31057 := I have lost many warriors storming the gates of their compound, but they use weapons of light and fire against us, and not even our war beasts are strong enough to breach their defenses.
31058 := Sometimes we can capture an Elder when they venture forth from their compound, and we have learned something about them. That is how we know they guard the ancient secrets.
31059 := But no matter what tortures we inflict upon them, they will not reveal their secrets to us. They fear the knowledge they themselves guard, and they will never willingly surrender it to us.
31060 := I know nothing of this disruptor field, but throughout the history of our tribe ships have fallen from the sky. It has always been this way; though in recent generations it has become more frequent.
31061 := We have little understanding of such magic to make metal fly, but my scouts rush to take whatever we can carry from the crash sites in the hopes we may one day unlock these secrets.
31062 := This was how we acquired our rancor war beasts. Several very young specimens were recovered from a crashed vessel. We raised them to adulthood, training and breeding them to be loyal beasts of war.
31063 := We thought the war beasts would allow us to destroy the Red Rakata tribe, but our enemy has a weapon to use against the rancor. That was why we needed you to destroy the Red Rakata for us.
31064 := They use grenades filled with gas that kills our beasts but does no harm to the handlers. The Red Rakata have many powerful weapons, though they are inferior warriors.
31065 := It is this technology - the weapons of our ancestors - that you must bring me from the Red Rakata tribe. With it we will finally be able to wipe them from the face of our planet.
31066 := There is little I can tell you about the Temple. I know the secrets of our ancestors are contained within, but the Temple itself is barred to us.
31067 := But only the Elders know how to bypass the barrier that surrounds it. Destroy them and bring back their secrets to us, and we will help you enter the Temple. That was our agreement.
31068 := Whether you found some other way into the Temple I cannot say. All that matters to me is that you did not fulfill your vow. The Red Rakata still live.
31069 := That was the only tome I found in the Elder's compound.
31070 := So you will help me enter the Temple?
31071 := Looks like we still need each other.
31072 := [Persuade/Lie] I will bring you back knowledge from the Temple.
31073 := I'm not going into the Temple without help!
31074 := Forget it! I'll find my own way into the Temple.
31075 := I see I have no choice. Okay, I'll go into the Temple alone.
31076 := I will go into the Temple alone.
31077 := Why do I have to go in alone?
31078 := I can't leave until I shut off the disruptor field inside the Temple.
31079 := I still need to shut off the disruptor field around this planet.
31080 := No, I'm not ready yet.
31081 := I'm ready to enter the Temple now.
31082 := [Force Persuade] You want to help me. I am your friend.
31083 := [Persuade/Lie] I'll destroy your enemy soon. But first I need to ask you some questions.
31084 := I'm not Revan anymore. That part of me is gone. I'm <FullName> now.
31085 := I have no clue what you are talking about.
31086 := I'm sorry, but I don't remember any of this.
31087 := My mind was destroyed. My memories were lost.
31088 := You can't force me to kill your enemies!
31089 := I will help you, but first you must answer my questions.
31090 := Temple of the Ancients? I still don't remember anything.
31091 := I'm going to need some information if you want me to succeed.
31092 := You should probably start with the last time I was here.
31093 := [Persuade/Lie] I will kill the Elders and bring you their secrets!
31094 := I'll be back after I kill the Elders.
31095 := I don't see any other choice, so I'll help you.
31096 := I need parts to repair my ship.
31097 := Tell me more about the Elders.
31098 := You say my ship crashed. Was it because of the disruptor field?
31099 := What kind of weapon can stop a rancor?

31124 := Who dares intrude on our meditations? You know the penalty for... Revan - you are back!
31125 := We have sworn allegiance to Malak. He has led the Sith to conquest and victory. Your time is over, Revan!
31126 := Malak told us what happened to you. The Jedi Council has stripped you of your power. You are a shell of what you once were!
31127 := You are not fit to rule the Sith anymore, Revan. Darth Malak will reward us greatly for destroying you!
31128 := Yes, the true Sith Lord has returned! Now bow before me!
31129 := I am Revan no longer. I serve the light and the Jedi Council now!
31130 := Zzzz...
31131 := Back again? I know my Master sent you, but I'm supposed to be resting and recovering. It will take time for the Kolto to repair the damage. *sigh* What do you want?
31132 := How may I serve you, Lord Revan?
31133 := Please, don't hurt me! I'm injured and unarmed! I can't even get out of this bed!
31134 := NO! Please, somebody help me!
31135 := I'm just one of the Sith apprentices - nobody important. I was injured when my Master sent me and two other apprentices out to investigate a ship that crashed here recently.
31136 := We didn't find the ship, but we stumbled across one of those rancors. It wasn't even full grown, but it took all three of us to bring it down.
31137 := None of us escaped unscathed, but I got the worst of it. The beast snapped my spine in the battle - I can't even walk anymore!
31138 := I have a broken back, remember? I can't walk. But if you want you could up my kolto dosage. That'll knock me cold for at least six hours. You don't have to hurt me or anything.
31139 := Since my Master sent you I guess I can answer your questions. What do you want to know?
31140 := Remember - tell my Master that I answered all your questions. I want to stay on his good side.
31141 := Good. The pain in my back is getting pretty bad, anyway. You'll actually be doing me a favor.
31142 := Lord Revan, I only followed Malak because I thought you were dead. But you are the Master I swore allegiance to. I will not betray you!
31143 := I will not betray you, Lord Revan. It is physically impossible for me, in any case. My injuries are so severe it will be weeks before I can leave this bed.
31144 := You think I'm gonna tell you all the Sith secrets just because I'm crippled? You won't get anything out of me!
31145 := [Success] My Master sent you? I guess it would be okay to answer your questions, then. What do you want to know?
31146 := I don't know much about the Star Forge, but I hear it has something to do with this temple. Maybe there might be information on it in the library down on the lower level.
31147 := I... I don't know. I swear. I'm just an apprentice. Why would they tell me anything like that?
31148 := [Failure] Do you think I'm an idiot? Revan is dead - everybody knows that! The Jedi Council killed him.
31149 := [Success] L-L-Lord Revan? Forgive me, Master. I didn't recognize you. Lord Malak told us all you were dead!
31150 := Please, Lord Revan - spare me! I didn't know you still lived.
31151 := [Success] No! Please, have mercy!
31152 := I'll tell you whatever you want to know! Just don't hurt me, please. Haven't I suffered enough as it is?
31153 := [Failure] You think you scare me? I've seen the torture my Master uses on spies. You couldn't do anything worse than that. Why don't you just leave me alone?
31154 := [Success] I'll tell you whatever you want to know! Just don't hurt me, please. Haven't I suffered enough as it is?
31155 := Lord Revan, you are the true Master. Whatever you command, I shall do. Ask your questions, Master. I am here to serve.
31156 := Then you should be easy to kill!
31157 := Who are you?
31158 := If I leave what's to stop you from sounding the alarm?
31159 := Sorry - it's too risky. I'll just kill you instead.
31160 := I want to ask you some questions.
31161 := I'll be going now.
31162 := Okay, I'll increase your kolto dosage to knock you out.
31163 := I trust your loyalty. But if you set off the alarm you will suffer!
31164 := I need some information.
31165 := [Force Persuade] Your Master sent me to ask you some questions. 
31166 := You're no use to me anymore. Time to die!
31167 := Where can I get information on the Star Forge?
31168 := How do I shut off the shields around the Temple?
31169 := How do I shut off the disruptor field protecting the Star Forge?
31170 := [Persuade] Don't you recognize me, fool? I am Darth Revan!
31171 := Obviously Malak lied to you!
31172 := Malak betrayed me, and all those who follow him shall suffer!
31173 := [Persuade] You're in no position to defend yourself right now.
31174 := [Persuade] I need information. Don't make this unpleasant for us both.
31175 := It's obvious you're never going to talk. Guess I'll just have to kill you.
31176 := Revan! Lord Malak told us you still lived. At last - a challenge worthy of my skills. I grow so bored with slaughtering these mindless training droids.
31177 := I intensified my training ten fold in the hopes I would get the chance to face you in mortal combat! I am glad to see my training has not been in vain.
31178 := [This door is sealed and there is no visible means of unlocking it.]
31179 := Revan! Darth Malak warned me you might return. Looks like the Dark Lord was right.
31180 := *Chuckle* You don't even remember me do you, Revan? The Jedi Council did really did deceive you, didn't they? I was one of the first who joined your cause.
31181 := I'm surprised the Jedi Council let you live after all you did. But I won't make that same mistake; my pets will make short work of you!
31182 := I am the Dark Lord - not Malak! Bow down before me!

31258 := You are stronger than I would have thought possible, after what the Jedi Council did to you. Seems that Malak was wrong - the power of the dark side is not lost to you after all, Revan.
31259 := Yes, Revan! I was there when you almost died in the trap set by the Jedi Council; I used the Force to preserve your life. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge.
31260 := The Council tried to exploit our bond. They hoped your memories would lead me to the Star Forge. But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also tasted the power of the taint within you!
31261 := You can deny what you are, Revan, but you are only fooling yourself. I know the truth. I have seen the shadows inside your mind.
31262 := Remember: I was there when you nearly died in the trap set by the Jedi Council. I used the Force to preserve your life, Revan. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge!
31263 := Do not mistake the power of the Force for love, Revan. It does not exist. Power is what forged our bond, and power is what made us both tools of the Jedi Council!
31264 := Our bond is not easily broken, Revan. Even when your mind was destroyed and reprogrammed with a new identity the bond between us endured.
31265 := These are not your true feelings, Revan. You are speaking as a tool of the Jedi Council - as I once did. But now I see how the Jedi used us both!
31266 := The Council tried to exploit the bond between us. They hoped I would draw out your memories to lead them to the Star Forge. We were slaves to their will - like all who follow the Jedi Code!
31267 := But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also felt the so called taint within you. I resisted it at first, but now I embrace the power of the dark side - your dark side!
31268 := Of course not! I have been reborn in the wake of destiny... *your* destiny! The power of the dark side is yours by right!
31269 := Mistakes? No, Revan - the only mistake you are making is the one you are making now! You deny yourself the power that is yours by right! Only now do I realize how strong you are.
31270 := You deserve to be the true Master of the Sith, not Malak. I see this now. Together we can destroy your old apprentice. Join with me and reclaim your lost identity!
31271 := Your mind was too badly damaged to ever fully restore your memories, Revan. But your power, your strength of will, the essence of who and what you are: these things still remain!
31272 := Once long ago you defied the Jedi Council, freeing yourself from their control. You claimed your rightful title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Together we can defeat Malak and take back what is yours!
31273 := It is your power that will keep me as your loyal apprentice, Revan. I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you once wielded.
31274 := But you have proven yourself in our battle; I see you possess the strength to destroy Malak and reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord. Now I see you will make a worthy Sith Master. 
31275 := No! This is the way of the dark side! Do not give in to the anger and hatred!
31276 := No! Don't give into your anger. Remain calm, remain focused. Don't let her twist your mind like this!
31277 := You are a pathetic fool, Revan! Together we could have defeated Malak and ruled over an Empire, but now I will be at Lord Malak's side instead!
31278 := You will be crushed with the Republic and all the fools who bow down to the Jedi Council! No one can stand against the power of the Star Forge and the Sith fleet!
31279 := I need deny my passions no longer, Revan. I would stand by your side gladly, as your lover and apprentice!
31280 := I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you had once wielded. But this... this would be much better.
31281 := I would be utterly yours, master! Together we would destroy Malak and you would reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord!
31282 := No! Do not walk down this path... it can only lead to destruction! I know of what I speak!
31283 := Shut up, Juhani! You know nothing of the dark side's true potential! When you felt its touch you fled to a cave and cowered in terror!
31284 := I have no wish to fight you and Bastila, but if you choose to walk down this path you know I must stand against you... even at the cost of my life.
31285 := Listen to me... the dark side leads to death and destruction. I've seen the horrors the Sith have unleashed on the galaxy. Turn away from this path.
31286 := Shut up, old man. Your time is over! The age of the Jedi and the Republic is no more! This is the age of Darth Revan and the Sith!
31287 := Don't do this, kid. I don't want to, but I'll fight you if I have to. Even if it costs me my life.
31288 := Yes! The sacrificial blood will consecrate this ancient temple in the name of the Sith! With the death of the Jedi the rebirth of Darth Revan will be complete!
31289 := I'm a Jedi... I'll never bow down to the Sith. If you go through with this I have no choice but to do battle against you.
31290 := Kill him! Grind his old bones to dust! Show him the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the dark side!
31291 := A true Jedi will never bow down to the Sith. If this is your decision I have no choice but to do battle against you.
31292 := Kill her! Rend her flesh! Show her the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the power of the dark side!
31293 := It's not to late for you, Bastila. The dark side is evil but it isn't all powerful. You can still fight against it. Don't let it consume you.
31294 := You are beneath my contempt, old man! You hid like a coward for decades on Kashyyyk! You know nothing about the true potential of the Force!
31295 := Bastila, it is not too late for you to be saved. The teachings of the Jedi can lead you from the dark side back into the light and a true understanding of the Force. 
31296 := You are beneath my contempt, Juhani. When you felt the power of the dark side you fled to a cave like some cowering animal! You know nothing of the Force or its true potential! 
31297 := But you, Revan - the power of the dark side is yours to command! You can use it to destroy Malak! With my help you could rule over the entire galaxy!
31298 := I... I don't. The only Revan I could respect is one who would break free of the Council's slavery. One who would grasp the power that lies before him... not the weak fool I see.
31299 :=  
31300 := Revan - I knew you'd come for me. Malak thought you might be afraid to enter the Temple again, but he doesn't know you like I do. Not anymore. Not since you've changed.
31301 := Come on, Bastila. We have to escape before Malak shows up!
31302 := Quickly, Bastila - come with us! We have to escape before Malak arrives!
31303 := Escape? You don't understand. I have sworn allegiance to Lord Malak and the Sith; I am no longer a pawn of the Jedi Council.
31304 := Surely you know what I mean, Revan. Look at what the Council did to you; they turned you into their puppet. The same thing they do to all who are truly strong in the Force.
31305 := You say that as if the dark side is some terrible entity. The Jedi Council has brainwashed you like all the others. Like they once did with me.
31306 := They speak of the dark side as if it something to be feared. But in reality their only goal is to manipulate those who are strong in the Force. The fear of the dark side is a tool to maintain control.
31307 := Why do you think the Jedi forbid you and Malak from joining the Mandalorian Wars? They knew you would realize your true potential and break free of their domination.
31308 := Malak has shown me how the Jedi Council have been using me the same way they once tried to use you. They've been holding me back because they knew one day I would surpass them all.
31309 := I resisted at first. I endured the Sith torments with the passionless serenity of a true Jedi, emptying my mind. But after a week of endless tortures I finally saw the truth.
31310 := Malak forced me to acknowledge my anger and pain. He showed me the liberating power of these emotions. Then he made me see how the Jedi Council has denied me what is mine by right!
31311 := The Jedi Council gladly used my Battle Meditation in their wars, but they still treated me like a child - like an inferior. They were jealous of my power... of what I could become!
31312 := They wanted me to bow and call them Master and follow their Code and obey their every order. But all the while they were exploiting my Battle Meditation for their own use!
31313 := A pity the power you once had is so diluted in you. You could have been strong as I am now... stronger, even. But that will never happen, now.
31314 := With the power of the Star Forge Malak will destroy the Republic and conquer the galaxy. And I will be the apprentice at his side - after I prove my worth by killing you!
31315 := You used to be Revan, Master of the Sith, but no longer. You are simply a pawn of the Jedi Council and the Republic they serve... like I was until Malak freed me from their shackles!
31316 := Lies? You are the one living a lie, Revan. The Jedi Council made you into something you are not; they programmed you to be their slave.
31317 := You think so, do you? You style yourself the Master of the Sith that you once were? To think I once envied you your passion, your power.
31318 := You are a sad little fool. You speak as if I were the same Bastila that you've known all along. But freed from the control of the Jedi Council I've become much, much more.
31319 := I almost wish you could see things as I do now. I wish you could join me and taste true power once again. Sadly, I doubt you are even capable any longer.
31320 := Now you see the power of the true Dark Lord!
31321 := Don't call me that. I'm not Revan anymore. I'm <FullName> now.
31322 := I draw my power from the light now, Bastila.
31323 := We are linked by more than just a bond, Bastila.
31324 := There is no link between us, Bastila! Not anymore!
31325 := That is how I know you will come back to the light.
31326 := Then why don't we join our power together, as it was meant to be?
31327 := If I am so powerful, then why do you serve another master?
31328 := What are you saying, Bastila?
31329 := No! This isn't the Bastila I knew!
31330 := Learn from my mistakes. It is not too late to come back to the light!
31331 := How can I reclaim my identity if I can't even remember it?
31332 := I'm not Revan anymore. I don't even remember those days.
31333 := How do I know you won't betray me?
31334 := I don't trust you. I think I'll just kill you instead!
31335 := No, I... don't want you like this. I want the woman I knew.
31336 := Yes! Together we can rule the galaxy!
31337 := You... you're right. I cannot do this. I reject the dark side!
31338 := Then you must die!
31339 := I am the Lord of the Sith! Bow down before me!
31340 := Death to the Jedi!
31341 := No, I will not kill my friend. I reject the power of the dark side.
31342 := Turn away from this path, Bastila. The dark side leads only to destruction.
31343 := The Dark Lord Revan is dead. I am a servant of the light now.
31344 := I don't want to rule the galaxy. I want you to return to the light.
31345 := Please, Bastila... if you feel anything for me, you won't do this!
31346 := A pawn of the Jedi Council? What are you talking about?
31347 := No, Bastila! Don't go over to the dark side!
31348 := It didn't take long to convert you, did it? I always knew you were weak!
31349 := If you've fallen under Malak's control you must die!
31350 := I am Revan, the Dark Lord! Bow down to me, Bastila!
31351 := Don't be lured in by these Sith lies, Bastila!
31352 := I like this side of you, Bastila. Now we can truly be together.
31353 := Don't do this, Bastila! Fight it! I'll help you!
31354 := It's not too late, Bastila! You can still turn away from the dark side!
31355 := No - I don't believe it! How could you betray us like this, Bastila?
31356 := Hold on - you have to disable the energy shield around this Temple before we can leave. I saw a computer up here. It might be connected to the power generators of this place.
31357 := And if you don't disable the disruptor field protecting the Star Forge, the Ebon Hawk won't be able to leave the planet without crashing.
31358 := You will have to disable the energy shield around this temple before we can leave. There is a computer here on the Temple summit that has access to the power generators.
31359 := You can also use it to disable the disruptor field that protects the Star Forge. Otherwise, the Ebon Hawk will not be able to leave the planet without crashing.

31412 := Kashyyyk Door 3
31413 := We... we shouldn't have done that. It was wrong. The Jedi aren't allowed to fall in love.
31414 := It was... it was a moment of weakness. When I kissed you... we shouldn't have... no, I'm sorry.
31415 := I know we both wanted it, but we shouldn't have given in to our desire. We're Jedi! We can't act like this. Not now, not while we still have to deal with Malak!
31416 := I'm... I'm sorry. I don't blame you, but... it was a mistake. I have to get out of here before somebody sees us together!
31417 := Oh, my!
31418 := Why do you think I came to this decision? I know how hard this is for both of us! You just kept pressing forward, so I had to be the one to step up and do the right thing!
31419 := But Malak must be stopped, my own feelings are nothing when compared to that. Yet I know this could affect the sake of our mission if it is not resolved - I can't let that happen!
31420 := What I have been trying to tell you is that I've reached a decision. But this is not the proper place for this discussion. I think... I think we should have some privacy for this.
31421 := We can talk about this the next time we return to the Ebon Hawk.
31422 := I think... I think we should have some privacy for this. Come with me.
31423 := Part of my purpose on this mission was to guide you in the way of the light; to help you avoid the temptations of the dark side. But I fear I've failed in that task.
31424 := No, I suppose you don't. At this point I imagine I'm doing you more harm than good.
31425 := You're like no man I've known before. And you're nothing like what I expected you to be after... after the Council sent us on this mission together.
31426 := I... I need time to think about all this. Things are... they are not going as I thought they would.
31427 := We should... we should continue on with our mission, for now.
31428 := Yes, of course. You're right. I... I have to remember my training. The Masters know well the corrupting influence of the dark side, although it is hard for me to imagine.
31429 := But enough soul searching for now. We should probably continue on with our mission.
31430 := But maybe it's time to change that. You deserve to know how much I respect and admire you. I had to tell you how much I care for you. As a friend, of course.
31431 := Please, it's... it's not allowed. I have to remain true to the Jedi ideal. If this is going to cause a problem maybe... maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
31432 := Besides, the events on Taris proved that the Force wanted to bring us together for this mission, and there is little left to chance when the Force is involved. Is that not enough for you?
31433 := I wondered if the Council wanted to see how I would help and guide you on our quest. I wondered if they were testing me to see if I was ready to become a Jedi Master myself.
31434 := And then I realized how foolish such thoughts were. As the Council explained, sending a Master in our group would only have drawn unwanted attention from the Sith.
31435 := The fate of the galaxy is at stake, the Council would not risk it merely to test me. They calculated the risks and in the end chose the only option available.
31436 := I said we were brought together for our mission: to stop Malak. I hardly think the Force would be pushing us towards a romantic involvement when the fate of the galaxy is at stake!
31437 := Please try to stay focused. I doubt the Council would approve if they knew we were busy discussing our mutual attraction when we should be saving the galaxy from Malak.
31438 := Finding the missing pieces of the Star Maps is our only hope of locating the Star Forge and defeating Malak. The Council explained all this quite clearly.
31439 := Mutual attraction? I never said... it's just an expression! Whatever our feelings... uh, I mean... whatever *your* feelings, you have to try to ignore them. Don't let this complicate things.
31440 := You never give up, do you? I admit I'm interested in you. I find you intriguing. Compelling, even. But it's not what you think.
31441 := You have a great gift. You have an awesome command of the Force, and I tremble when I think of how you might misuse it.
31442 := What? I... no! No, of course not! Not like that, anyway. In many ways you are... you are dangerous. You could be the savior of the galaxy; or you could bring untold destruction upon us all.
31443 := A lecture won't be much use if you aren't prepared to listen. I suppose it would be best if we didn't speak about this for a while. Let's just return to our mission for now. 
31444 := You are easily the vainest, most arrogant man I have ever met! Besides, I know you can't be serious, since I was purposefully *not* staring in your direction.
31445 := An amusing description, but hardly the truth. We both know the real reason you have some idea of what I am thinking: the bond we share.
31446 := I only hope I will have the wisdom to help you through the dark times. But for now, we should return to our mission.
31447 := My thoughts remain hidden, including whatever my feelings are for you. Uh... I mean whatever I feel *about* you... uh... I mean whatever I *think* about you.
31448 := I... that is, you... Why must you be so impossibly infuriating?! You know very well what I'm really talking about. I'm referring to the bond between us; the one the Jedi Council spoke of.
31449 := I suppose I'll just have to speak to you again later. Hopefully you'll be a little more... mature.
31450 := I suppose I'll just have to speak to you again later. Hopefully you'll behave a little less like a little boy and a little more like a... like a man!
31451 := But I imagine you've had enough questions for a while. So many things have happened to you since Taris. It's probably a lot for you to absorb.
31452 := We can speak again later, after you've had time to think about all this.
31453 := Don't worry, these are simple questions. Nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?
31454 := Touched a nerve, no. Getting on my nerves, most definitely. I suppose this is what you men consider being witty. *sigh*
31455 := Now, are you going to answer my questions? Or would you rather just keep annoying me?
31456 := Please! I'm a Jedi. Such feelings, such attractions, are... well, they're beneath me, quite frankly.
31457 := I admit, I find you intriguing. Uh... I mean, I find your command of the Force intriguing. But my interest in you is purely academic. Surely you can understand why.
31458 := You also avoided detection by the Sith, discovered I was a Vulkar prisoner, gained sponsorship for the race and became the Taris swoop champion. That's quite a resume.
31459 := Your modesty is admirable. But though others helped, you were the catalyst for these events.
31460 := Yes, I can see you do not lack in ability; although modesty is another matter.
31461 := Perhaps. But the Force works through all of us to some degree or another. There are some individuals outside the Jedi Order that we considered 'Force Sensitive'.
31462 := The Force is in all of us, though for most people it is a barely measurable whisper. But there are some individuals outside the Jedi Order that we considered 'Force Sensitive'.
31463 := It is obvious to me that the Force has been working through you. There is no other explanation for your great success, though I am not certain what to make of this discovery.
31464 := Perhaps if you weren't - well, if you were younger the Jedi might take you for training. But as it is...
31465 := Ah, yes, the rescue again. Very well. For what it's worth, I conceed the point to you: you rescued me from Brejik. And yet we're still stuck on here on Taris.
31466 := I'm sorry; I've overstepped my authority. I'm speaking of things that are best left to the Jedi Council. For now let's just accept the fact that you are... gifted.
31467 := Hopefully between your abilities, my Jedi training and the skills of our companions we can find a way off this planet.
31468 := Actually, your presence at the swoop track is what I'm curious about. It couldn't have been an easy task to find me there. Yet somehow you managed.
31469 := I want to talk to you about what happened between us.
31470 := So that's it? It's all over?
31471 := That's okay - I never felt anything for you anyway.
31472 := Great - you learn a lesson and I get dumped!
31473 := I... I understand, Bastila.
31474 := You're rationalizing, Bastila. You're just scared to face the truth!
31475 := I'm going to stop Malak, Bastila. But I want to do it with you at my side.
31476 := You don't always have to be strong, Bastila. Give in just this once.
31477 := You know I'm right, Bastila.
31478 := I love you Bastila. And I know you love me.
31480 := We're not going back to this again, are we?
31481 := It didn't feel wrong to me.
31482 := Shut up and kiss me, you babbling fool.
31484 := So I was just a stepping stone to you becoming a Master?
31485 := This is nothing but an excuse! You're afraid to face your feelings!
31486 := Difficult for you? What about me?
31487 := If you have something to say, just say it!
31488 := Just give in to your feelings, Bastila. I know you want to.
31489 := So no you'll finally leave me alone for good?
31490 := You aren't my teacher, Bastila. We're supposed to help each other.
31491 := We're made for each other, Bastila. You have to see that.
31492 := You have to trust in the wisdom of the Jedi Code.
31493 := We could be more than friends, Bastila.
31494 := No, I'm glad you did. I care for you too, Bastila. As a friend.
31495 := I'm still not convinced.
31496 := I guess that makes sense.
31497 := You're right. I suppose we should get back to the mission now.
31498 := If the Force wants us to be together, why do you keep resisting my undeniable charms?
31499 := I'm sorry, Bastila. I know our mission is important.
31500 := Mutual attraction? I knew you were interested in me!
31501 := I think we both know the real reason you've been watching me.
31502 := I won't misuse my power, Bastila.
31503 := I make you tremble? Do you get all tingly inside, too?
31504 := You never tried to get in touch with your father again?
31505 := Spare me the lecture. I'm not in the mood.
31506 := I don't see how falling in love could lead to the dark side, though.
31507 := Well, you keep staring at me. See anything you like?
31508 := You have feelings for me?
31509 := You're so cute when you're embarrassed.
31510 := I don't like being manipulated!
31511 := Okay, I'll answer a few questions.
31512 := Whoa, guess I touched a nerve there, huh?
31513 := Uh... the second one.
31514 := I think you're interested in more than just the 'bond' between us.
31515 := I had a lot of help: Carth, Mission, Zaalbar.
31516 := What can I say? I'm a talented individual.
31517 := I think you're underestimating us non-Jedi.
31518 := Are you trying to say I can control the Force?
31519 := I don't want to talk about this anymore.
31520 := Be glad I'm Force sensitive, or I couldn't have rescued you.
31521 := What are you trying to say?
31522 := Oh, you can tell, can you?
31523 := Oh, yeah? Well listen, beautiful, I don't need to take this abuse. I get enough female Jedi bashing from Bastila, thank you very much.
31524 := What?! No! I mean... no! Don't be crazy!
31525 := Was there ever any doubt?
31526 := What? You must be joking. I'd be lucky not to get my eyeballs seared out of their sockets.
31527 := Oh no you don't! I'd have to shoot you down first, and I'm not kidding.
31528 := You think so? I could probably get the same kind of attention from a blaster rifle.
31529 := Ha! No, wait, wait, don't go. Not just yet.
31530 := Now *that* I'd like to see. Or would I? You've got my damn head on backwards, you know that?
31531 := Wouldn't you like to know. Just you wait, sister.
31532 := Uh. *That* is one bet I'm not about to take. Not a chance.
31533 := Anyway... as fun, uh, as this is, I do have to talk to you about something serious. Really serious. Uh, is this a good time?
31534 := And just what would you do if I wasn't? No, no, wait, don't answer that. I don't want to know.
31535 := Err... I'm not that bad, am I?
31536 := Damn it, woman, if you keep hounding me I'm going to put you over my knee and teach you a lesson!
31537 := You just wait, you'll get yours.
31538 := At any rate, I wasn't ogling you. I've just been admiring you.
31539 := Oh, no, I'm not even going there, sister.
31540 := No, no, I didn't mean it that way.
31541 := I had... had nothing left after that, really. I devoted myself to the fleet. Hunting Saul was my only purpose.
31542 := She had courage... and she was stubborn. Heh... a little bit like you in that respect. I could never talk her out of anything once she put her mind to it.
31543 := Oh? I don't know if I like the sound of that...
31544 := So... you do accept my apology. Huh. Good. Good. I'm glad.
31545 := You know you, uh... you aren't so bad to have around, you know that?
31546 := Right. Off we go.
31547 := More than that. But... anyway... we should be off...
31548 := I don't know. What am I going to have to do for it?
31549 := I...heh, I really think that we should, ah... get going.
31550 := I'm sorry. I'm glad things are better between us, now. We should... we should go.
31551 := Oh, the usual. Well that's not so hard. Let's get to it, then, shall we?
31552 := Well, damn it, I want to know why that is! I want some questions answered!
31553 := Well... yeah, true enough, I guess. But, damn it, I'm tired of nobody telling me anything!
31554 := I'm not trying to provoke you or imply that you're somehow responsible for the Jedi Council... but give me a hand, here! There has to be a reason!
31555 := No, I don't... I didn't mean that you weren't wanted, or that I want to go! It's just... damn it!
31556 := Look, I didn't mean it that way. I want to get to Saul, not... no... no, forget it. It seems all I can do is insult you, isn't it?
31557 := Just forget I said anything. Let's... let's... just get on with what we were doing.
31558 := I would be more than happy to, but she's as close-mouthed as the rest of the Council. I'm hoping you'll be the one to enlighten me.
31559 := Very cute. If you got any cuter, you'd pass for a Gamorrean's sister.
31560 := Look, I'm serious. No one seems to want to tell me anything, and it's starting to irritate me.
31561 := With good reason. Admiral Saul Karath is the commander of the entire Sith fleet. He's half the reason Malak has done so well in the war.
31562 := I didn't want to, maybe. Are you so sure you would have?
31563 := Well... there's more to the story, I guess.
31564 := Listen, sister... just because we're working together does not mean you get to badger me with constant questions!
31565 := Blast it if you aren't the most frustrating woman to talk to! Isn't there someone else you can harass for a little while?
31566 := Wait... *sigh* I didn't mean it that way. Don't go, damn it.
31567 := Look, I suppose I... could use someone to talk to. I'm just not used to it. And I don't know why you're so interested. But here goes.
31568 := Oh no, I'm not falling for that one. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
31569 := I... *sigh* Okay, I give up. You win.
31570 := What? Me? What did I do?
31571 := Heh heh. Well I might be willing to take you up on that challenge. But uh, you're just not going to let up, are you? Fine... you want to know why I don't trust anyone? Here goes.
31572 := You do? Fair enough. What do you want to discuss?
31573 := Well, that's too bad, then, because it's not going to change.
31574 := Not all of us have the luxury of a choice. I'm conditioned this way, sorry.
31575 := I don't need to be analyzed, thanks. Can we just get back to business?
31576 := No, I don't want to talk about it. What I want is to save the galaxy... if that's even possible.
31577 := It's not what I want. I have a duty and I intend to see it through. The galaxy's in danger and I want to save it... that's what I want!
31578 := And I don't need all these questions. What I do need is to try and save the galaxy, if that's even possible.
31579 := Why is whether or not I trust you or anyone so damned important to you? Why... why do you even care?
31580 := We don't have time for this, so can we please just... drop it. For now? Can we pick it up later if you really must, I... want to get underway.
31581 := Is that your idea of an insult? Come on, sister, take your best shot.
31582 := Oh, ouch. I think you hurt my man-feelings with that one.
31583 := Wouldn't think of it. Feel better now?
31584 := I guess I did. Feel better now?
31585 := *Sigh* Look... all I mean is that if you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.
31586 := Good. Then maybe we can talk reasonably about this.
31587 := All I've been trying to say is that this isn't personal. If you were smart, you wouldn't trust anyone, either... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.
31588 := You're probably one of the most skilled women I've ever met. You've saved my butt more than once and I'm lucky you're here to help me, no question.
31589 := I guess I did say you could ask me questions later, didn't I? Is this really necessary?
31590 := Pretty snappy with the orders, are we? Okay, you got it... sir.
31591 := Oh no, how can I resist a challenge to my manly pride, huh? Ha ha! Fine, you've made your point. Interrogate at will.
31592 := All my secrets are purely of the mundane variety, unfortunately. Nothing worth extracting, though you're welcome to try.
31593 := Let me ask you something first, though. I've been going through the battle aboard the Endar Spire over and over in my head since we crashed.
31594 := Some things just don't add up for me. Maybe you could tell me what happened... from your perspective.
31595 := Look... it has nothing to do with you, personally. I don't trust anyone, and I have my reasons.
31596 := And, no, I'm not going to discuss them. So can we just keep our mind on more important things?
31597 := Good. Like I said before, I prefer action to talk, anyway.
31598 := Alright, Alright. You're pretty damned tenacious, you know that?
31599 := We'll talk about it... but later. Right now I just want to get going.
31600 := Alright, alright. You must be the most damned persistent woman I've ever met.
31601 := If I was, you wouldn't have to ask. So don't worry about it.
31602 := I don't get testy. I get angry. And if I was angry, you wouldn't have to ask me if I was, let me assure you.
31603 := No, I was just joking, though you do seem to be full of questions. It's rather refreshing, to be honest.
31604 := Oh. Well, if it's an interrogation you wanted, why didn't you say so?
31605 := No. No, I don't have a problem with it, really. Go ahead and interrogate me.
31606 := I'm all ears, beautiful.
31607 := Maybe I'm just avoiding your questions. Is this really necessary?
31608 := Which? The fact that I'm all ears or the beautiful part?
31609 := Not really. Just a habit. You have something you'd rather I call you by?
31610 := Heh heh. A little bit touchy, are we? Is there something else you'd prefer I called you?
31611 := I might consider it. What are you going to call me, in exchange?
31612 := I like the first part of that. I'm a bit more partial to "the most handsome pilot in the galaxy". What do you think?
31613 := Well, then, I guess "gorgeous" will have to do until then, won't it?
31614 := Kidding aside, I bet you're not about to give up on those questions of yours. Are they really necessary?
31615 := Don't get yourself in a twist over it, gorgeous. I didn't mean anything by it.
31616 := All business today, eh? Are these questions really necessary?
31617 := Oh, for crying out -- fine. If it'll make you feel better, you call me something. Go ahead, come on, I can take it.
31618 := Is that it? You can do better than that!
31619 := Ouch. Heh heh heh. That *is* better. Well, I bet "beautiful" doesn't sound so bad in comparison now, does it?
31620 := Guilty as charged. I'll bet you still have those questions in mind, though. Are they really necessary?
31621 := Stubborn as ever. Okay, you got me. I bet you have your heart set on those questions. Are they really necessary?
31622 := What? Are you afraid you'll hurt my feelings? Come on, spit it out. You can do it.
31623 := Is there something else you'd prefer I called you?
31624 := You're the one who wanted to know more about me. Well this is it, this is what I am.
31625 := I know that. I'm not angry at you... don't think that. I must not be making much sense.
31626 := You probably mean well with your questions. I'm just not accustomed to talking about my past very much. At all, actually.
31627 := I know. Don't worry about it. I just... must not be making much sense.
31628 := I just can't believe he's dead. I... you should have stopped him! You should have done something to prevent this!
31629 := Oh, don't give me that innocent look! You can talk a Hutt out of his credits, you could have found a way... you could have saved him!
31630 := He was my son!!
31631 := I... I wish we hadn't come. I wish I'd never found him.
31632 := No. If it did, I would never have met you.
31633 := No, I did fail him. And so did you. I wish I'd never met you.
31634 := I'm sorry, too. And I'm sorry I ever met you.
31635 := I... no, I didn't mean that. Please... maybe it would be better if we continued with the mission. I want to... take my mind off this.
31636 := Saving the galaxy is what's important now. My son... I can mourn my son later. When we're done. So... let's just go.
31637 := Is it? You seem just fine at pulling off the near-impossible... when you want to.
31638 := Why didn't you want to? You knew how important finding Dustil was to me! You... you've helped others, why not him? Why not me?
31639 := All the blame? No. Part of the blame, though... part of the blame is yours. The rest is mine.
31640 := You could have. But... you're only partly to blame. I'm to blame for all the rest.
31641 := I can't help but wonder if part of you didn't enjoy this. I thought we might be friends, but with you... heh, who can tell?
31642 := No, I see that. I don't know what I was expecting, telling you all I did. The blame is mostly mine for this, anyway.
31643 := Is it? I find it hard to tell which side you're on, sometimes. Still... not all the blame is yours. Most of it is mine.
31644 := I don't understand.
31645 := It doesn't take Jedi powers to read a man, believe me.
31646 := Well, your mouth keeps opening. That's a sign, I think.
31647 := Oh. So there's something between you and Bastila.
31648 := So I'm crazy now, am I?
31649 := I've seen the way you look at her.
31650 := So someone would be crazy to like Bastila? I'll have to tell her that.
31651 := You love the attention. Admit it.
31652 := Good idea. I'll go get one.
31653 := Oh, I think there's things I can do that a blaster can't.
31654 := I could leave you alone with one, if you prefer.
31655 := Don't like it, huh? What are you going to do about it?
31656 := Bring it on, flyboy. I bet I take you down.
31657 := Sure, sure. You're all talk, Carth.
31658 := I can. Do you need to talk?
31659 := You've been keeping something to yourself?
31660 := It means a lot to me, Carth. Thank you.
31661 := If you were any more obvious, your eyes would fall out of your head.
31662 := Relax, Carth, I'm teasing you.
31663 := I'd still like to know what you see that interests you.
31664 := Hah! I'd like to see you try!
31665 := Is that a promise?
31666 := Not for a monkey-lizard, no. Not bad at all.
31667 := I'm blind, now, am I?
31668 := Oh, I get it. You think I'm stupid, right?
31669 := I mean that's a damn poor excuse for an apology.
31670 := I do, if that's alright with you.
31671 := What happened after that?
31672 := I don't know. Maybe you should work for it, a bit.
31673 := No need to start sweating, Carth. I was only teasing.
31674 := I have my uses. Let's go.
31675 := I knew there was a reason we kept you.
31676 := I know. I'm very charming, I'm told.
31677 := Don't you want me to accept your apology?
31678 := Just a little kiss. How about it?
31679 := I was only joking, Carth, relax.
31680 := No kiss, then?
31681 := Just make sure you don't need to make any more apologies. Deal?
31682 := Blow away the bad guy. Save the damsel in distress. The usual.
31683 := Yes, here I am. And I'm not going anywhere.
31684 := I have more of a purpose here than you do, flyboy.
31685 := Same could be said for you.
31686 := Why don't you ask Bastila?
31687 := You were born out of the loop.
31688 := Better than a Gamorrean's mother.
31689 := The things you say!
31690 := That name sounds familiar.
31691 := How could you have not seen through that?
31692 := I'd do the same thing in your shoes.
31693 := That's terrible. I feel awful for you.
31694 := I'm not going to repeat myself, Carth, You owe me.
31695 := You're damn right it does.
31696 := Do we have another problem, now?
31697 := Well, I wouldn't want you to feel harassed. Have it your way.
31698 := What exactly is it about me that frustrates you?
31699 := Alright, then, I'll leave you alone if that's what you want.
31700 := And you say I'm frustrating to deal with.
31701 := Really? It's hard to tell.
31702 := *I'm* frustrating? Look who's talking!
31703 := Never mind. I'll leave you alone, since I'm so frustrating.
31704 := You don't know? Typical male.
31705 := Oh, that's rich. Where have you been?
31706 := I can make you talk, Carth. Trust me.
31707 := I'd like to know now if we have a problem.
31708 := We didn't finish our conversation last time.
31709 := I want to talk about these issues you seem to have with me.
31710 := No, I do take it personally!
31711 := I wouldn't want to live like that.
31712 := Pretty pithy advice, I see.
31713 := Ahhh... so you don't trust yourself, is that it?
31714 := You sure you don't want to talk about it?
31715 := So leave. Be on your own, it's obviously what you want.
31716 := I don't need someone around who doesn't trust me.
31717 := Don't tell me to calm down, you ignorant bantha!
31718 := We'll just see whose head explodes, you ungrateful monkey-lizard!
31719 := Drooling Bomarr cast-off!
31720 := Gamorrean pig-man!
31721 := Don't patronize me.
31722 := Well, you had it coming.
31723 := Not really. This is still serious.
31724 := Maybe a little.
31725 := Answer the damn questions, already.
31726 := Don't be such a child. It's just a few questions.
31727 := Excellent. Soon all your secrets will be mine!
31728 := You do know we're on the same side, right?
31729 := Are you always this suspicious?
31730 := Yes, let's do that.
31731 := You haven't heard the last from me on this.
31732 := I consider this important.
31733 := Are you getting angry again?
31734 := Are you getting testy again?
31735 := This isn't an interrogation. I never said that.
31736 := I just would like to know you better.
31737 := Not if you have a problem with it.
31738 := Why do I get the impression that you're not serious?
31739 := I like the sound of that.
31740 := The beautiful part. Keep calling me that.
31741 := Carth, are you flirting with me?
31742 := Keep addressing me like that and you might lose an ear or two.
31743 := How about 'gorgeous'? I like that better.
31744 := How about "handsome thug"?
31745 := I'll think about it.
31746 := I think I'm going to be ill.
31747 := Don't hold your breath.
31748 := I'd prefer you didn't call me anything. It's demeaning.
31749 := How about my name?
31750 := Forget it. Let's get back to my questions.
31751 := Now that one I like. Call me that from now on.
31752 := That's no good, either.
31753 := There you go again!
31754 := How about "pushy thug"?
31755 := How about "sexist worm"?
31756 := Sexless marsh-toad!
31757 := Brainless, lice-ridden bantha!
31758 := Lobotomized Gamorrean!
31759 := Ha ha! You are such a pain, you know that?
31760 := Maybe not, but I still don't want you calling me that.
31761 := What? Don't be ridiculous.
31762 := 'Beautiful'? Isn't that a little inappropriate?
31763 := You're right. I should have tried.
31764 := Don't try blaming me for your problems, Carth.
31765 := Me? Why am I suddenly at fault?
31766 := He was a Sith, Carth, remember?
31767 := Wishing won't help matters, will it?
31768 := You didn't fail him, Carth. You did your best.
31769 := I'm sorry for your loss, Carth.
31770 := That seems a lot to expect from me.
31771 := Stop trying to put all the blame on me.
31772 := I'm sorry, Carth. I wish I could have stopped this.
31773 := We're not friends, Carth.
31774 := You think I enjoyed it? That's pretty low.
31775 := I was an experienced Padawan, surely... but not yet ready to be a full Jedi and certainly not ready to train another. Especially not one so old as my wife.
31776 := Not to mention that I had remained a Padawan throughout the war. A formality, perhaps, but with the trial it had to be decided if I was worthy to become a Jedi at all.
31777 := They said I had learned wisdom the hard way. For all I had done during the war, they wished to raise me to full Jedi status at long last.
31778 := Nope. Never was. Technically I never rose above the rank of Padawan, for various reasons. Does that surprise you?
31779 := No I didn't. I may never have become a Jedi technically, but I'm an old Padawan with a lifetime of experience. That applies both to the Force as well as topics like love.
31780 := In my case, becoming a Jedi would have been a formality. I doubt the order and I would have gotten along well, considering my opinions on things such as love.
31781 := Heh. I suppose I'm not prone to live my life like most of the Jedi Masters do, that's true. My opinions on love are no different.
31782 := Not even a Jedi? You mean not any more, right?
31783 := Yes. You lied to me.
31784 := You seem to have all the abilities of a Jedi...
31785 := Not the way you describe your past, no.
31786 := Yes, of course. I would never jeopardize our mission. However, if we get the opportunity I would like to visit Tatooine.
31787 := Bastila's right. We don't have time for this.
31788 := We're on an important mission here, Bastila.
31789 := Don't be rude, Bastila.
31790 := Never mind.

This model of alacrity stim uses a very powerful mixture of chemicals to produce an incredible increase in the dexterity of the user. Stim bonuses that affect the same statistic do not stack.
31796 := Attribute Bonus: Constitution +6
Duration: 120 secs

Steeling the user against pain, this stim provides a very large boost in constitution. Stim bonuses that affect the same statistic do not stack.
31797 := This device improves the wearer's reflexes by triggering prolonged bursts of adrenaline. It is thought to be perfectly safe, with only a few instances of uncontrolled muscle spasms.
31798 := This Republic unit improves on the basic Stealth Mode field by dampening all sound that the user might make. Opponents must make an Awareness check versus user Stealth skill +2 or remain unaware of them. The user must have paid points into the Stealth skill to gain the use of Stealth Mode. Combat disrupts the field, but mundane tasks do not.
31799 := This sophisticated Eriadu Stealth Mode unit expertly camouflages the user. Opponents must make an Awareness check versus user Stealth skill +6 or remain unaware of them. The user must have paid points into the Stealth skill to gain the use of Stealth Mode. Combat disrupts the field, but mundane tasks do not.
31800 := Bonus: Vitality max +16pts
Attack: +2
Damage: +2
Duration: 120 secs

This stim removes all distractions, allowing the user to focus purely on the battle. The user is almost oblivious to damage suffered. Stim bonuses that affect the same statistic do not stack.

Duration: 120 secs

This stimulant produces a chemical cocktail that sends a boost of adrenaline through the body, focusing the mind and bolstering the user's tolerance for damage. Stim bonuses that affect the same statistic do not stack.
31802 := Included are an improved assortment of tools and parts needed for a droid to repair itself after being damaged in combat. This kit can't be used by living beings. Advanced kits repair 25 vitality points + INT modifier + (2 x user's skill in Repair).
31803 := This kit contains all the necessary parts for a droid to repair itself after being damaged in combat, including electrical regulators designed to isolate malfunctions. This kit can't be used by living beings. Construction kits repair 35 vitality points + INT modifier + (3 x user's skill in Repair).
31804 := This unit misdirects opponents by creating 5 holo-projections of the user. A successful attack on one of the projections disrupts energy flow and causes that image to fail.
31805 := This item uses microbursts of counter-current energy to calm unsteady nerves, increasing accuracy in the handling of volatile materials. The user must have basic knowledge of Demolitions (paid points into the skill) to benefit from this item.
31806 := These gauntlets are quite stiff, minimizing actions that might interfere with the manipulation of volatile materials. The user must have basic knowledge of Demolitions (paid points into the skill) to benefit from this item.
31807 := Tensor-mesh stiffens the forearm for steady handling of volatile materials. The insect-like Verpine don't personally use these items, claiming they merely mimic their own exoskeletons. The user must have basic knowledge of Demolitions (paid points into the skill) to benefit from this item.
31808 := This implant micromanages the cardiovascular system, effectively increasing the user's constitution faster and further than hard work and exercise might.
31809 := This implant boosts the regular energy impulses of the nervous system, sharpening the performance of dexterous action. Inactive users may suffer the odd lingering twitch.
31810 := This implant stimulates the brain, effectively increasing the user's capacity for intelligent thought, all at a price cheaper than a trip to the libraries of Coruscant.
31811 := This implant releases synthetic versions of the natural stimulants produced by the body, temporarily boosting the user's stamina.
31812 := This implant does use relatively experimental nano-technology to speed healing, but relies more on coagulants and solid doses of pain relievers. If you feel better, you are better.
31813 := This ocular implant greatly increases visual acuity, allowing the user to better track enemy movement in combat. General awareness will improve as well.
31814 := This implant regulates the nervous system, preventing loss of consciousness due to sudden impact or sensory overload.
31815 := This implant bolsters the immune system, prompting it to react immediately aggressively toward any virus or bacterium that might have otherwise resulted in a debilitating sickness.
31816 := This implant stimulates cardiovascular performance well beyond the user's norm. The Bavakar Medical Research Labs are at the forefront of developmental cybernetics.
31817 := Stimulants and energy bursts allow this implant to boost a user's reflexes well beyond normal. The Bavakar Medical Research Labs are at the forefront of developmental cybernetics.
31818 := This implant controls a cocktail of synthetic nutrients, encouraging quick thought in the user. The Bavakar Medical Research Labs are at the forefront of developmental cybernetics.
31819 := This implant maintains an ever-circulating stream of antitoxins in the user, increasing relevant antidotes for specific poisons introduced. Side effects include dry mouth.
31820 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

These are invaluable tools that increase visual acuity by analyzing light on several frequencies above those of normal sight.
31821 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

A built-in micro tracking processor means a user wearing these goggles can detect almost any movement.
31822 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

Bothans treat information like any other resource, and invest a great deal in devices that help collect it. These Bothan visors are considered to be among the best in the galaxy.
31823 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

The Verpine only manufacture this product for export, having no need of it themselves. They have highly evolved sight, a quality they smugly say the visors mimic but do not exceed.
31824 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

Bothans place great importance on the tools of the information trade. They would consider these items to be of average quality, though their standards are exceptionally high.
31825 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

With this item, Durkish Corporation abandoned visual detection in favor of aural, citing that most creatures breathe, and even camouflage fields can't blend the sound of that away.
31826 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

In a fine balancing act, this unit amplifies the faint sounds of moving creatures, while filtering out louder background noise that might otherwise deafen the user.
31827 := This kit contains an array of hypospray injectors filled with a broad chemical mix that quickly overwhelms viral or bacterial infections, effectively curing most known diseases.
31828 := These rods are used to record audio logs. They are popular among researchers and politicians.
31829 := Damage: None
Secondary:
Entangle for 15sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Long

These grenades cover the target area in a gooey bio-adhesive that traps anyone caught within the effect. It quickly degrades, allowing allies to soon pass unhindered.
31830 := Created initially by Gungis X Weapons, blaster carbine rifles have become very popular in recent years, helped by falling prices due to competition from other companies.
31831 := This is a modification on the blaster carbine rarely seen outside of Sith-controlled space.
31832 := This blaster rifle variant is one of many fine weapons produced by the factories of Cinnagar in their continued militarizing after the Great Hyperspace War a thousand years ago.
31833 := The Zabrak mercenary Jurgan Kalta commissioned this rifle, a weapon he liked to think of as "amusingly destructive."
31834 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

This was the weapon of mercenary Jamoh Hogra, and was supposed to protect him against the many enemies he earned in his lifetime. Hogra's skill didn't match its potential, however.
31835 := The most common ranged weapon in the galaxy is the basic blaster pistol, firing a bolt of intense coherent light powered by a replaceable power pack.
31836 := The Mandalorian Blaster is a slightly more powerful version of the basic pistol common throughout the galaxy.
31837 := This is a versatile blaster variant, possibly of ancient Arkanian origin. The Arkanians are very proud that such early efforts continue to be prized among collectors and soldiers.
31838 := This blaster is the staple of the Zabrak mercenary, known for deadly accuracy and exceptional damage.
31839 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

This blaster belonged to Bendak Starkiller, a duelist legendary on Taris. It is a highly adaptable weapon, and is definitely of better quality than any standard issue pistol.
31840 := More powerful than the commonly available pistol, the blaster rifle is favored by soldiers throughout the galaxy. Civilian ownership of these weapons is not generally encouraged.
31841 := Despite its effectiveness, these modified blaster rifles are not often employed by the Sith. They prefer to engage their enemies up close and personal.
31842 := These weapons are almost overpowered for their size, but the Mandalorians prefer them that way. They do not make a habit of being subtle in their war making.
31843 := These weapons are almost beginning to cross the line to light artillery. Armor is generally ineffective against such a weapon, unless it is of the highest quality.
31844 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

Jurgan Kalta wanted to make a big noise in the galaxy. If it was the screams of his enemies, all the better. This weapon was his favorite because it shared his adaptability.
31845 := The bowcaster is an invention of the Wookiees of Kashyyyk. Also called a laser crossbow, it actually uses a magnetic accelerator to hurl an explosive energy quarrel at its target.
31846 := Damage: Cold, 20pts
Secondary:
Paralyzation for 6sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Long
Save:
DC15 for half damage, negates paralyzation

A CryoBan grenade releases a supercooled liquid that freezes on contact, causing intense pain and damage to victims caught in the effect.
31847 := Echani Firedancers use the double bladed Ritual Brand in a dodging and slicing pattern so graceful it looks more like a dance than combat.
31848 := Twisted by the dark side, the Krath favored weapons of fearsome appearance requiring brute strength to wield, and the blades of this weapon are certainly effective, if not elegant.
31849 := Held by the Dark Jedi even before he fell to the dark side, this may be one of the few truly personal items owned by Ajunta Pall, and remains as thoroughly corrupted as he.
31850 := These pistols are illegal in many planetary systems, being regarded as too powerful a weapon to be owned by civilians. Disruptors reduce solid matter to its constituent molecules. Unlike typical blasters, disruptors ignore most types of personal energy shields.
31851 := A weapon similar to this energy-propelled slug-thrower belonged to Jigger Wraith, a bounty hunter who plagued the Republic years ago. Thirty-seven Mandalorians were executed for being him until sightings declined. As a type of disruptor, this weapon ignores most personal energy shields.
31852 := This disruptor is even more destructive than its pistol counterpart, and is outlawed on just as many worlds. Disruptors reduce solid matter to its constituent molecules. Painfully. Unlike typical blasters, disruptors ignore most types of personal energy shields.
31853 := Zabrak always command respect, especially with the aid of weapons that are even more damaging than already-outlawed standard disruptors. Unlike typical blasters, disruptors ignore most types of personal energy shields.
31854 := Damage: Heat, 36pts
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Long
Save:
DC15 for half damage

These grenades release a quick burst of an incendiary agent that ignites immediately, damaging all enemies within the area of effect.
31856 := Damage: Piercing, 20pts
Area of Effect: 4 meters
Range: Long
Save :
DC15 for half damage

Fragmentation grenades are very basic. They explode when thrown, showering the enemy in shrapnel. It's not elegant, but it's definitely effective.
31857 := Sometimes called a "sleeper," the hold out blaster is the preferred method of temporarily incapacitating an enemy.
31858 := An unconscious opponent is a quiet opponent. This weapon is a Bothan favorite, designed to "create opportunities."
31859 := These weapons are designed to incapacitate so death may be quick or lingered upon as desired. Droids are simply dispatched, as cruelty is best rationed among the living.
31860 := For serious espionage, this is the weapon of choice. Simple ownership can get you arrested in some systems, or invited to dine with royalty, depending on what it helped you learn.
31861 := This weapon again increases the firepower available to the foot soldier or mercenary, but it is not for the lightly armored who wish to be quick on their feet.
31862 := With this weapon, the Mandalorians again demonstrate a complete lack of subtlety. The only thing better than a big blaster, apparently, is one that shoots faster.
31863 := These resemble regular blasters in the same way Quoorian marshsuckers resemble mosquitoes. Sure, they both do damage, but the former definitely has the edge in kill-potential.
31864 := Arkanian designs of this kind predated mass acceptance of heavier pistols, but 2000 years later they are still superior performers.
31865 := The Zabrak killed many pirates who were attempting to seize shipments of these weapons and then sold them on the black market anyway. It's not a matter of where they end up, but of who gets paid.
31866 := Mandalorians boast that a shot from one of these pistols can take a starship out of commission. It's an obvious exaggeration, but for safety's sake, most listeners just smile and nod.
31867 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

Cassus Fett was rarely seen without this adaptable blaster. Famous for killing the captain of a flagship Republic frigate at the Battle of Jaga's Cluster, he is presumed dead.
31868 := Unlike a typical blaster, this weapon fires a stream of energy very damaging to electrical systems, causing havoc on the internal components of droids.
31869 := Demonstrating this weapon, the insect-like Verpine destroyed legions of droids, doing nothing to quell the public's suspicions of what testing their stun guns must have been like.
31870 := Damage: Ion, 15pts
(45pts vs. droids)
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Long
Save:
DC15 for half damage

These grenades emit an extremely strong burst of energy devastating to any droids or personal shields caught in the effect.
31871 := Any well-stocked militia usually has stores of ion rifles in reserve. They aren't much use against the living, but if the enemy has battle droids these weapons become essential.
31872 := Droids can be difficult obstacles for a spy, but these weapons take all the guesswork out of dealing with them while doing nominal damage against organics as well.
31873 := While they may have borrowed liberally from designs the Bothans initiated, the Verpine say you can't argue with results. These weapons are simply devastating against droids.
31874 := Traditionally associated with the Jedi, the lightsaber is a devastating weapon difficult to master. Properties can vary with the type of focusing crystal used in construction.
31875 := Twisted by the dark side, the Krath tempered swords with the power of the Force perhaps even before lightsabers became the weapon of the Jedi, both dark and light.
31876 := The mere presence of Dark Lord Naga Sadow would come to imbue his personal weapons with the taint he carried, poisoned as his spirit was.
31877 := Damage: Special

Secondary:
Poison, 4 pts every 3 sec
Duration: 30sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Long
Save:
DC25 for no effect

This grenade unleashes a blast of poison gas that affects the nervous system, lingering in the air to ensure that the effect is not escaped easily.
31878 := The Massassi were a proud race altered by the Sith millennia ago, and subsequently exterminated along with Exar Kun. This weapon was the symbol of a proven warrior.
31879 := This may have belonged to a Sand People warrior famous among his kind for killing a young Jedi, but the one tribe that kept the oral history of this event was wiped out long ago.
31880 := This weapon allows the user to fire more quickly than usual, increasing his chances of survival without drastically changing the amount of equipment he would normally carry.
31881 := The blaster cannon is a favorite among captains wealthy enough to hire experienced, dangerous crews and who might need a way to take them out quick if things go bad.
31882 := During the reign of Naga Sadow the Massassi were transformed into foot soldiers for the Sith. This was their traditional weapon, altered, as they were, to serve the dark side.
31883 := Attributed to Empress Teta, this blade speaks of her background as a warrior and her willingness to be on the frontline of the Great Hyperspace War a thousand years ago.
31884 := Damage: Sonic, 20pts

-6 Dexterity for 30 seconds
Area of Effect: 4m

negates dexterity penalty

These grenades explode loudly, but the majority of their effect is delivered in disorienting frequencies the ear can barely perceive, even as it is damaged.
31885 := Sometimes referred to as "squealers", these weapons deliver a high-frequency jolt to the senses that can damage and potentially disorient an opponent.
31886 := This is an improvement over the standard sonic pistol design that must seem doubly shrill to the large ears of the Bothans.
31887 := More powerful than the pistol, the sonic rifle fires a blast of sound that causes a great deal of sensory overload in addition to damage, disorienting the victim.
31888 := This was conceived as a "last resort" weapon should espionage fail and a quick retreat be called for. It is effective, but the Bothans would prefer that it not be needed.
31889 := The Arkanians pioneered many non-lethal weapons that could disorient opponents, but most were retrofitted to be superior damage dealers as well because the initial demand for them was so low.
31890 := A useful tool for espionage, this weapon is more effective than the standard stun baton, but is still available on most worlds. High-density discharge cells make this item unwieldy and unusable in the off-hand.
31891 := A very effective device used by Bothan elite. Some systems consider simple possession of one as grounds for execution as a spy. High-density discharge cells make this item unwieldy and unusable in the off-hand.
31892 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

Weighted to fit a Rakatan grip, this item is most like a stun baton. It seems more adaptable than one of Republic issue, though similar high-density cells make it unwieldy and unusable with weapons in the off-hand.
31893 := Damage: None
Secondary: Stun for 9sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Long
Save:
DC15 for no effect

This type of grenade explodes in a concussive wave of force that disrupts the senses of both organic and inorganic targets in the area of effect.
31894 := Damage: Energy, 60pts
Secondary: Knockdown
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Long
Save:
DC15 for half damage

This Republic device contains a baradium compound that produces a small fusion energy explosion of great force. Civilian possession of these items is outlawed almost everywhere.
31895 := Ultrasonic vibrations make this double-bladed sword exceptionally deadly. A rare Echani cortosis weave protects it against lightsaber sparring damage, ensuring effectiveness even against Jedi and Sith. The double-bladed sword is capable of inflicting more damage - but is also less precise - than the single-bladed variant.
31896 := Though most favor lightsabers, some Sith prefer the more visceral feel of metal cutting flesh. These blades are usually impregnated with rare cortosis to protect against lightsaber sparring damage.
31897 := Excess energy from the generator in this vibrosword is conducted directly through the blades. Also possessing a rare lightsaber-deflecting cortosis weave, this weapon is a deadly Echani masterpiece.
31898 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

Yusanis was the most famous of Echani warriors, fighting against oppression and villainy until encountering Darth Revan. Discovering that Revan had killed an Echani senator, Yusanis attempted to tell authorities but fell to the powers of the Sith Lord despite his own impressive abilities and the cortosis weave inherent in all Echani vibroblades.
31899 := Small size makes this a good off hand weapon. Echani vibroblades use a rare cortosis weave to prevent lightsaber sparring damage, allowing traditional swordplay to continue in the time of Jedi and Sith.
31900 := Twisted by the dark side, this Krath weapon is as deadly as a modern vibroblade. It was meant for assassination, and a cortosis weave that prevents lightsaber sparring damage ensured that even Jedi must respect it.
31901 := These blades are typically used in the off hand. In addition to a cortosis weave that deflects lightsaber sparring damage, some Echani vibroblades are supercooled to keep them in alignment, giving them an icy sting.
31902 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

Sanasiki used this weapon to kill Nelinik, a Zabrak who assassinated the Echani High Protector with battle droids. Cortosis protects the blade against lightsaber sparring damage while energy cells disrupt droid opponents.
31903 := This was a weapon of distinction in the time of the Krath. Protected against lightsaber sparring damage, Sith would grant these cortosis-laced blades to only the most loyal underlings.
31904 := Traced to the Bladeborn, a Sith offshoot dedicated to sword mastery, these cortosis-laced weapons were given to "masterblades" who survived no less than ten lightsaber-wielding warriors in combat.
31905 := These swords were crafted to honor Raskta Fenni, the best Echani duelist of her time. Many were sold, but imperfections in the difficult lightsaber-deflecting cortosis weave caused few to survive.
31906 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

The great Bacca was hunting the Shadowlands ages ago when an alien ship crashed through the forest. He saw that first contact as a warning of the destruction outsiders could bring. Made from the debris, this sword is a reminder for his people that trust must be given cautiously, and only to those who have earned it.

"The pupil known as Dustil has shown remarkable progress. His talent with the Force is great. The same, however, cannot be said for the human female that he arrived with, Selene.
She has little talent. Moreover, Dustil holds a great degree of affection for her. This is a weakness in the boy and has been slowing down his training.
Orders were sent this morning to have the girl removed from the academy and terminated. I will tell Dustil that she was killed in the valley. He will forget her soon enough, I think... he is too promising to lose at this juncture."

Mandalorian

Due to the rigorous training and conditioning he received as a Mandalorian soldier, Canderous has the ability to consciously direct his body to reduce the effects of combat damage. While conscious, he constantly regenerates one vitality point every six seconds.
32069 := Unique Ability: Bastila

Body Fuel is an activated ability that lasts for 30 seconds. During this time Bastila regenerates all of her Force points every round (3 seconds). However, whenever she uses a Force Power, she takes Vitality damage equal to the Force Point cost of the power.
32070 := Prerequisites:
Cathar

Camouflage hides Juhani in the same manner that a scoundrel hides using the Stealth ability. She remains camouflaged for 60 seconds or until she attacks or uses another Force Power on an enemy.
32071 := EXITING SYSTEM...
32072 := Prerequisites:
Cathar

This ability allows Juhani to determine if living hostile creatures are in the area. Using this ability will allow her to determine how close and how big enemies are.
32073 := Unique Ability: Jolee 

Psychic Static is an activated ability. It lasts for 6 seconds per level. For its duration, all enemies in the area of effect (8-meter radius around Jolee) come under a confusion effect. There is a 20% chance that the creature acts normally, a 40% chance that the creature attacks its nearest ally and a 40% chance that the creature does nothing.
32074 := Prerequisites:
Wookiee

When Zaalbar flies into a rage he gains +4 to his Strength and Constitution. He also gains a +2 bonus on Fortitude and Will saves and has a -4 penalty to his Defense rating. This effect lasts for 60 seconds.

32076 := Universal Power
Prerequisites:
Character Level 9

This power allows the Jedi to shield the entire party in the Force, granting immunity to poisons and disease and absorbing the first 15 points of damage from sonic, fire, cold and electrical attacks directed at them. Damage over and above the first 15 points is suffered as normal. This effect lasts for 120 seconds.
32077 := Proficiency All
32079 := Battle Meditation
32080 := Unique Ability: Bastila

This rare ability allows Bastila to coordinate large fleets or armies during wartime, influencing base emotion and morale on a grand scale. It can have a dramatic effect on the tide of a battle, but is not applicable to small-scale combat.

Sneak Attack I adds 1-6 points of extra damage to attacks when the target can't respond to the attacker. The extra damage is applied to attacks made from behind the target, attacks against stunned or otherwise immobilized targets, and any attacks made while in Stealth Mode (combat cancels Stealth Mode, but the first attack receives the bonus). 
Sneak Attack only works if the target is within 10 meters. The extra damage is not multiplied in the case of a critical hit.

32357 := Chuundar's personal weapon is a bowcaster with some unusual Czerka modifications. Most Wookiees would likely not appreciate such outside influence.
32358 := Damage: None

Secondary: Stun for 9sec

Area of Effect: 3.3m radius

Save :
DC15 to negate stun

Carefully set flash mines can stun any enemies unfortunate enough to step on them. This is the basic model.
32359 := Damage: Piercing, 18pts

Area of Effect: 3.3m radius

Save :
DC15 for half damage

Frag mines send blasts of shrapnel through any nearby enemies. This is the basic model.
32360 := Damage: Special

Secondary:
Poison, 3 pts every 3 sec

Duration: 30sec

Area of Effect: 3.3m radius

Save:

32361 := Damage: Heat, 24pts

Area of Effect: 3.3m radius

Save:
DC15 for half damage

When stepped on, plasma mines emit a short burst of intense heat, searing all enemies nearby. This is the basic model.
32362 := Concerning demolitions, the Bothans prefer well-equipped droids for the task of explosives management, and invest research accordingly. A droid must have basic Demolitions software (paid points into the skill) to benefit from this item.
32363 := This basic probe improves a droid's demolitions capabilities, allowing for more sensitive adjustments of volatile substances. A droid must have basic Demolitions software (paid points into the skill) to benefit from this item.
32364 := Wartime contracts over the last forty years saw a great deal of money poured into Verpine droid modifications, particularly in the area of demolitions. A droid must have basic Demolitions software (paid points into the skill) to benefit from this item.
32365 := Gamorrean Battleaxes, much like their namesake species, are heavy, unsubtle, and generally a very damaging influence in almost any situation.
32366 := Though initially they might seem cumbersome, Wookiee Warblades are actually a very efficient design. Kept in continual motion, they can cut a swath through almost anything.
32367 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Melee

Application of this alloy can strengthen a melee weapon, increasing damage and possibly resistance to damage. The modifications require a workbench with adequate tools and a weapon of high quality marked as upgradeable.
32368 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Melee

This modular projector can cause a melee weapon to do additional energy-based damage. The modifications require a workbench with adequate tools and a weapon of high quality marked as upgradeable.
32369 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Melee

This cell increases the energy output of certain blaster types, allowing skilled users to better deliver powerful attacks. The modifications require a workbench with adequate tools and a weapon of high quality marked as upgradeable.
32375 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Ranged

This scope increases the accuracy of certain blaster types, increasing the user's effectiveness with sniper attacks. The modifications require a workbench with adequate tools and a weapon of high quality marked as upgradeable.
32376 := Well, that would be a loss, I'm sorry to say. Better luck next time?
32377 := Would you like to have another round of Pazaak?
32378 := This droid appears to be heavily armed, though it is ignoring you for now.

32420 := The Star Forge is under assault from the entire Republic fleet! If I don't use my Battle Meditation to turn the tide, Admiral Dodonna's capital ships will destroy the Star Forge.
32421 := I have to stay here in the command center so that I can best use my Battle Meditation against our enemy. If I don't the Star Forge will be lost! 
32422 := You must go to face Malak without me. Find him, kill him and reclaim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith!
32423 := That's all for now.

32441 := We have a stowaway on the ship. Do you have any advice for me?
32442 := I... I idolized her and the stories they told of her. She was everything that I had dreamed a Jedi could be. I still believe she was that way.
32443 := Do you know if anything can be done about all these gizka?
32444 := I was wondering if you could help me with our stowaway problem.
32445 := Do you know anything about these gizka creatures?
32446 := You got any advice on our little stowaway?
32447 := Sorry, but we don't have time for this now.

32497 := The most common weapon of bravados and smugglers, the blaster pistol fires a high-energy particle beam designed for short-range combat.
32498 := These exotic weapons are rare, and most often associated with Jedi attracted to the dark side of the Force, for whom reckless aggression is sometimes considered an asset.
32499 := Traditionally associated with the Jedi, the lightsaber is a devastating weapon difficult to master. Properties can vary with the type of focusing crystal used in construction.
32500 := Medium Repeating Blaster
32501 := Crystal, Blue
32502 := Special:

32510 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Blade Color: Red

A facetted crystal used in the constructing of a lightsaber. It glows faintly with an inner red light.
32511 := Lightsabers can come in shorter styles, often used in the offhand during two-weapon fighting. As in larger versions, different focusing crystals can produce additional effects.
32512 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

Sanasiki used this weapon to kill Nelinik, a Zabrak who assassinated the Echani High Protector with battle droids. Cortosis protects the blade against lightsaber sparring damage while energy cells disrupt droid opponents.

32518 := A Desert Hunt
32519 := The Twi'lek hunter Komad has tracked a krayt dragon to its lair and wants assistance drawing the creature out.
32520 := Komad maintains that the only way to bait the krayt dragon out of its lair is to tempt it with banthas. Banthas will need to be lured into position with bantha fodder. Some of the Sand People may carry fodder, and there might also be some in the enclave. The vendor in the Anchorhead spaceport may also have some.
32521 := Komad is dead, but he already told you how to bait the krayt dragon out of its lair. You'll have to lure banthas into position by tempting them with bantha fodder. Some of the Sand People may carry fodder, and there might also be some in the enclave. The vendor in the Anchorhead spaceport may also have some.
32522 := As Komad said to do, you have several banthas following you, lured by the scent of fodder. You must lead them to the mouth of the krayt dragon lair.
32523 := The hunt was successful and the krayt dragon is dead. Whatever might be hidden in the depths of its lair is now yours to claim.
32524 := Like Komad said, you now have the bantha fodder you need to lure the banthas in the Eastern Dune Sea to the krayt dragon lair.
32525 := The banthas are positioned at the mouth of the krayt dragon lair. The beast could emerge any time now.
32526 := A Doubting Sith
32527 := You have encountered a student by the name of Kel Algwinn, an unusual student at the Sith academy who confessed to you that he has strong feelings of doubt that this is the appropriate place for him to be. Such knowledge would be dangerous if it fell into the wrong hands.
32528 := You encountered a Sith by the name of Kel Algwinn who really didn't belong in the academy... and you told him as much. While the Sith might disagree with your advice, Kel took it to heart and immediately left. Perhaps it is for the best.
32529 := You encountered a Sith by the name of Kel Algwinn who really didn't belong in the academy... in fact, you advised him to think about joining the Jedi, instead. Kel took your advice to heart and decided to leave the Sith and think about it. Who knows? Perhaps someday you might find him amongst the ranks of the Order?
32530 := You told Lashowe of Kel Algwinn's doubts about remaining in the Sith academy. There is little reason to believe that she would hesitate to turn such information over to Master Uthar. You will probably not be seeing Kel Algwinn again.
32531 := Master Uthar has been informed of Kel Algwinn's doubts. He was highly impressed by your ruthlessness, and noted that Kel would be "spoken to" shortly.
32532 := You encountered a Sith student by the name of Kel Algwinn who was full of doubts about whether or not he belonged in the academy at all. Unsurprisingly, you were easily able to goad him into a rage and kill him. No doubts there now.
32533 := A Quest for the Star Forge
32534 := The Jedi Council has instructed you to seek out the ancient Star Maps scattered about the galaxy in the hopes of uncovering the location of the mysterious Star Forge, as Revan and Malak did before you.
32535 := You've discovered another ancient Star Map in the Sith Tombs of Korriban. As before, the map is incomplete. But each map you find fills in more missing pieces of the puzzle. Hopefully, once you find all the Star Maps they will give you the location of the Star Forge.
32536 := You've discovered another ancient Star Map in the Dune Sea of Tatooine. As before, the map is incomplete. But each map you find fills in more missing pieces of the puzzle. Hopefully, once you find all the Star Maps they will give you the location of the Star Forge.
32537 := You've discovered another ancient Star Map on the sunless surface of Kashyyyk. As before, the map is incomplete. But each map you find fills in more missing pieces of the puzzle. Hopefully, once you find all the Star Maps they will give you the location of the Star Forge.
32538 := You've discovered another ancient Star Map beneath the oceans of Manaan. As before, the map is incomplete. But each map you find fills in more missing pieces of the puzzle. Hopefully, once you find all the Star Maps they will give you the location of the Star Forge.
32539 := You've discovered the last of the Star Maps and now have the hyperspace coordinates that will lead you to the Star Forge and a final confrontation with Malak. You only hope you aren't too late, for Bastila's sake... and the sake of the entire galaxy.
32540 := When approaching the Star Forge, the Ebon Hawk fell victim to a disruptor field and crashed on an uncharted planet. In order to escape this world you'll need to find a way to disable the disruptor field, as well as find the necessary parts to repair your ship.
32541 := You have reclaimed your true identity and Bastila has sworn her allegiance to you. But there is still the matter of Malak, your old apprentice. Only when you face him and destroy him on the Star Forge will your victory be complete.
32542 := Bastila has turned to the dark side and sworn allegiance to Darth Malak. The Republic is on its way, but if you don't get to the Star Forge and stop Bastila from using her Battle Meditation against them, the fleet is doomed. You also suspect Malak will be waiting for you there.
32543 := A Rancor in the Sewers
32544 := Mission has warned you of a not so small obstacle between you and the entrance to the Vulkar base: a full grown rancor. Getting by the beast won't be easy.
32545 := You've managed to get past the rancor, proving once again that size and brute strength aren't everything.
32546 := A Wookiee Lost
32547 := The Wookiees are worried about a popular member of their tribe that has recently gone missing. Rorworr cannot be found. His friends Jaarak and Woorwill await him in Woorwill's home.
32548 := You have found the corpse of the missing Wookiee Rorworr in the Shadowlands. A datapad revealing that he dealt with slavers was on the body, as well as a bowcaster bolt casing that probably belongs to whoever killed him.
32549 := You have found the corpse of a Wookiee called Rorworr in the Shadowlands. A datapad revealing that he dealt with slavers was on the body, as well as a bowcaster bolt casing that probably belongs to whoever killed him.
32550 := The bolt casing found on Rorworr's corpse belongs to Jaarak. Jaarak may be the one that killed Rorworr.
32551 := Jaraak has been accused of killing Rorworr. He has offered no defense and awaits judgment from Worroznor, the Holder of the Laws.
32552 := Jaarak has been killed for the murder of Rorworr. No defense was offered.
32553 := Jaarak was not killed for the murder of Rorworr. Rorworr was dealing with the slavers, and was a traitor to his kind.
32554 := The Wookiees are worried about a member of their tribe that has recently gone missing.
32555 := Aiding Lashowe
32556 := Yuthura has told you that of your rivals Lashowe might be a good one to approach... she might very well be easily tricked into allowing you to "help" her. Yuthura says that you must be ruthless if you were to take advantage of such a situation, and only that would impress Master Uthar.
32557 := You have convinced Lashowe into allowing you to help her recover a relic she is aware of in the Valley of the Dark Lords: an ancient but corrupt Jedi holocron that would surely be worthy of prestige by Master Uthar. She has gone out into the valley to wait for you amongst the pillars in the center of the valley.
32558 := You and your rival, Lashowe, have worked together to defeat a tuk'ata mother beast and recover an ancient but corrupt Jedi holocron. Lashowe was insistent on returning it to Uthar herself. Somehow you doubt that you and she will be sharing the prestige for the holocron like you planned.
32559 := Sure enough, Lashowe has turned the corrupt Jedi holocron you worked together to recover over to Master Uthar by herself. You will receive no prestige for it.
32560 := You and your hopeful rival, Lashowe, worked together to defeat a tuk'ata mother beast and recover an ancient but corrupt Jedi holocron. Lashowe was insistent on returning the holocron to Master Uthar by herself, however, and the two of you battled. Lashowe was killed, but you now have the holocron for yourself.
32561 := You turned over the ancient, corrupted Jedi holocron to Master Uthar... who was not only impressed at your possession of the relic, but seemed quite pleased by the fact that you had dispatched one of your rivals, as well. You have earned a great deal of prestige today.
32562 := You turned over the ancient, corrupted Jedi holocron to Master Uthar... and while you didn't tell him of Lashowe's exact fate, you got the impression that he didn't care overly much what happened to her. At any rate, you have earned prestige for bringing him the holocron.
32563 := Lashowe had betrayed you by bringing the ancient, corrupted Jedi holocron to Master Uthar herself, denying you the prestige that you were supposed to share. The fact that you killed her for it seems to have impressed Master Uthar considerably... he has rewarded you with prestige for eliminating a potential rival.
32564 := Attack on the Endar Spire
32565 := The Endar Spire is under attack. Your cabin mate, Trask, has warned you that the Sith have boarded the ship in search of Bastila, the commander of the vessel. You and Trask have to find her before the Sith do.
32566 := You and Carth escaped the Endar Spire on the last remaining pod, jettisoning mere moments before the doomed ship is utterly destroyed.
32567 := The layout of the Endar Spire and other important information has been loaded into your electronic journal. You can access the map or your journal at anytime during the game to track your progress on your various quests and missions.
32568 := You've received a message from Carth Onasi, a highly respected Republic soldier. He's ordered all hands to the bridge to protect Bastila.
32569 := You've reached the bridge, but Bastila is nowhere to be found. She likely made her way to the starboard escape pods. If you want to get off the Endar Spire alive you should do the same.
32570 := Bastila
32571 := Bastila is more concerned about getting underway than in talking, at the moment. Perhaps later on, after the Jedi Council has been spoken to and you are more experienced you might wish to try talking to her again.
32572 := You may want to try talking to Bastila again a little later. She might be more willing to talk at the next planet or once you are more experienced.
32573 := Bastila is more intent on completing the mission right now than talking. Perhaps once you have found another of the Star Maps and have become more experienced you can try speaking to her again.
32574 := Bastila wants to talk to you... but in privacy, away from the others. Speak to her again when you have returned to the Ebon Hawk.
32575 := There's nothing more that needs to be said at the moment. Your relationship with Bastila is going to depend on the outcome of this mission, and perhaps once it is over with the two of you can look at what it is going to become. For now, however, the mission is more important... as is your destiny.
32576 := There is nothing more to talk about with Bastila, at least for the time being.
32577 := Bastila's Mother
32578 := You encountered someone named Malare who told Bastila that her mother was looking for her. Bastila has asked that you look for her mother. Her name is Helena and Malare reported that she saw her last in the colony of Anchorhead on Tatooine.
32579 := Bastila agreed to consider her mother's request: to locate her father's body and recover his holocron. It should be out in the Tatooine desert... likely near wherever krayt dragons exist... though Bastila did not promise that she would give her father's holocron to her mother even if she did find it.
32580 := Bastila's father's holocron has been found out in the desert, still intact. Bastila is unsure, however, whether she intends to give it back to her mother. Part of her thinks she should keep it for herself... she and her father were close. Either way, it is probably a good idea to return to her mother at the cantina.
32581 := Bastila and her mother have parted on good terms. Her mother insisted Bastila keep the holocron, and while she is indeed dying from an illness Bastila promised to try and help her once the mission is done. While Bastila is sad that her father is dead, she is happy that her relationship with her mother looks hopeful.
32582 := The final meeting with Bastila's mother did not go well. Bastila and her mother argued, and Bastila ended up deciding to keep the holocron for herself. They parted on poor terms, unlikely ever to see each other again... and the weight of the encounter seems to press unhappily on Bastila's shoulders.
32583 := Bendak's Bounty
32584 := There is an official government bounty out on Bendak Starkiller, a famous duelist reknowned for killing dozens - if not hundreds - of people in illegal death matches. Bendak has been known to frequent the areas in the Upper Cantina near the dueling ring.
32585 := You've located Bendak Starkiller in the Upper City cantina, but it looks like the only way you can collect his bounty is if you manage to beat him in the duel ring. Of course, you have to become the Taris duel champion before he'll come out of retirement to face you...
32586 := Bendak Starkiller's reign of terror is over, thanks to your efforts in the duel ring. Zax, like most others on Taris, was well aware of the Starkiller's demise when you returned to collect your bounty.
32587 := Captured by the Leviathan
32588 := You've been captured by the Leviathan, a Sith interdictor ship commanded by Saul Karath, Carth's former mentor. Badly outnumbered and outgunned, there is little you can do to keep the Sith from taking you prisoner. Your only hope of escape rests on Mission's slender shoulders. 
32589 := You've been captured by the Leviathan, a Sith interdictor ship commanded by Saul Karath, Carth's former mentor. Badly outnumbered and outgunned, there is little you can do to keep the Sith from taking you prisoner. Your only hope of escape lies with T3-M4.
32590 := You've been captured by the Leviathan, a Sith interdictor ship commanded by Saul Karath, Carth's former mentor. Badly outnumbered and outgunned, there is little you can do to keep the Sith from taking you prisoner. Your only hope of escape rests on Jolee's wizened shoulders.
32591 := You've been captured by the Leviathan, a Sith interdictor ship commanded by Saul Karath, Carth's former mentor. Badly outnumbered and outgunned, there is little you can do to keep the Sith from taking you prisoner. Your only hope of escape rests on the broad shoulders of Canderous Ordo.
32592 := You've been captured by the Leviathan, a Sith interdictor ship commanded by Saul Karath, Carth's former mentor. Badly outnumbered and outgunned, there is little you can do to keep the Sith from taking you prisoner. Your only hope of escape rests on Juhani's graceful shoulders.
32593 := You've been captured by the Leviathan, a Sith interdictor ship commanded by Saul Karath, Carth's former mentor. Badly outnumbered and outgunned, there is little you can do to keep the Sith from taking you prisoner. Your only hope of escape lies with HK-47.
32594 := Now free from your cells you, Carth and Bastila have to get to the Leviathan's bridge and open the hangar doors so you can escape before Darth Malak arrives. You just hope that Carth's desire for revenge against his former mentor isn't going to complicate things.
32595 := You've escaped the Leviathan and survived a confrontation with Darth Malak himself. But the cost of your survival is high: Bastila is now a prisoner of the Dark Lord, and you must come to grips with the shocking revelation that you are, in fact, Darth Revan - the former Lord of the Sith.
32596 := Carth
32597 := You can probably talk to Carth some more a little later, perhaps after you've gained some more experience.
32598 := Carth is more interested in getting things underway at the moment than talking. Perhaps try talking to him again later, when things are more resolved and you have some more experience.
32599 := Carth is more interested in getting the mission underway at the moment than talking. Perhaps try talking to him again later, after you've found another of the Star Maps and you have some more experience.
32600 := Carth is devastated after finding out who you truly are. Give him some time. Perhaps once the Star Maps have been found and the mission is nearer to its conclusion, you might want to try talking to him again.
32601 := There is nothing more that remains to be said. Whatever becomes of you and Carth will have to be determined once your destiny is resolved... one way or the other.
32602 := Carth and you have nothing more to talk about, for the moment.
32603 := Chieftain in Need
32604 := The Wookiee chieftain Chuundar has taken his brother Zaalbar from you and demands that you kill a mad Wookiee in the Shadowlands. Gorwooken waits for you further down the Great Walkway, and will show you how to descend into the lower forest.
32605 := Chuundar is not so beloved as he would have you believe. People doubt him, but there is no one to take his place. Chuundar still holds Zaalbar, however, and waits for you to do as you were told and kill the deranged Wookiee in the Shadowlands.
32606 := A Czerka repulsor field blocks passage into the Lower Shadowlands. You will have to find someone that is willing to help you pass it before you can continue the search for the mad Wookiee Chuundar would have you kill.
32607 := A Czerka repulsor field blocks passage into the Lower Shadowlands, halting your search for the mad Wookiee Chuundar would have you kill. Jolee Bindo said he would remove barriers from your path if you first helped him.
32608 := Jolee Bindo has helped you pass the Czerka repulsor field so you can continue your search for the supposedly mad Wookiee that Chuundar wants killed.
32609 := You have encountered the Wookiee that Chuundar sent you to kill. He seems almost feral, and will have to be subdued before he will respond to reason.
32610 := Freyyr is not the maddened creature Chuundar suggested he was. You have decided to hear him out.
32611 := Now that it has been recovered, Bacca's blade can be returned to Freyyr so he can raise allies against Chuundar.
32612 := You have killed the Wookiee Freyyr as Chieftain Chuundar asked. Return to him for your reward.
32613 := Freyyr has returned to regain leadership of Rwookrrorro, and you have helped Zaalbar decide to join with his father against Chuundar.
32614 := Freyyr has returned to regain leadership of Rwookrrorro, but you have prodded Zaalbar to side with his brother Chuundar against their father.
32615 := Chuundar was very appreciative that you killed Freyyr, his and Zaalbar's father. Zaalbar, too, has decided it was for the best, adopting his brother's darker view of the future.
32616 := Chuundar was very appreciative that you killed Freyyr, his and Zaalbar's father. With your urging, Zaalbar too has decided it was for the best, adopting his brother's darker view of the future.
32617 := Freyyr was very grateful that you helped him regain his place as chieftain. He will see that his people are restored to glory and that Zaalbar is no longer an outcast.. 
32618 := You have returned Bacca's blade to Freyyr. He has gone to rally support and will meet you back in Chuundar's throne room. He's counting on your support.
32619 := You have set the bait in place, recreating the ritual that should lure out the Great Beast, just as Freyyr said.
32620 := Freyyr, Zaalbar's father, has asked that you find Bacca's blade. It was lost in the "Great Beast's" hide during a ritual hunt. Recreating the hunt may draw the creature out. The ritual area is south of Freyyr. A suitably large creature will be needed for bait.
32621 := Freyyr, Zaalbar's father, has asked that you find Bacca's blade. It was lost in the "Great Beast's" hide during a ritual hunt. You have found the body of a large viper kinrath that may serve as bait in a recreation of the hunt. The ritual area is south of Freyyr.
32622 := You have recovered the blade of a very ornate looking weapon. This would likely be very important to the right Wookiee.
32623 := You have tied the viper corpse to the vine, just as was probably done by years of Wookiees before you. What purpose this ritual has, you don't know.
32624 := Freyyr, Zaalbar's father, has asked that you find Bacca's blade. It was lost in the "Great Beast's" hide during a ritual hunt. He does not know it yet, but you already found the blade on your own.
32625 := Dead Settler
32626 := You have found the body of Casus Sandral. The journal you found on the body tells that he was an amateur archaeologist who was investigating strange ruins across Dantooine. By the wounds on his body, it would seem that he was mauled to death by kath hounds.
32627 := You have given Casus' journal to his father, Nurik. This may help ease the pain of his loss.
32628 := Desert Ambush
32629 := You have been ambushed in the desert by Gamorrean hunters. They will want payment of some kind to allow you to leave.
32630 := The Gamorrean ambush has ended in violence.
32631 := You managed to appease the Gamorreans that ambushed you, and they left without violence.
32632 := You successfully intimidated the Gamorreans who ambushed you. They fled into the desert.
32633 := Dia's Bounty
32634 := Dia has explained to you that she attacked Holdan in self-defense when he began making drunken advances. In retaliation, he ordered a bounty to be placed on her head.
32635 := Holdan has agreed to remove the bounty from Dia's head in exchange for enough credits to soothe his stinging pride.
32636 := Not surprisingly, Dia was very excited to discover that the bounty on her head has been lifted. Thanks to you, she no longer has to fear retribution from Holdan for merely defending herself.
32637 := A waitress named Dia has had an illegal bounty placed on her by Holdan, one of Davik's men. Apparently she attacked him in the cantina, and Holdan retaliated by putting a price on her head.
32638 := Thanks to your intervention, Holdan has withdrawn the bounty from Dia's head. Now the only thing left is to tell Dia herself the good news.
32639 := Droid For Sale
32640 := Yuka Laka claims to have a unique droid for sale, one that can apparenly even translate the dialect of the Sand People, and that is also combat ready. HK-47 is what it is called.
32641 := You have spoken to HK-47, a droid eager to be purchased from Yuka Laka in Anchorhead. It is a translator and an effective combatant.
32642 := You have purchased HK-47 from Yuka Laka in Anchorhead. It is apparently able to translate the Sand People dialect as well as handle itself well in combat, if it is to be believed. It is very reluctant to speak of itself.
32643 := Elora, Sunry's Wife
32644 := Elora professes Sunry's innocence. She claims that this is some sort of frame-up by someone who wants to get revenge on him. Sunry was an old war hero against the Sith, so they might harbor him ill...
32645 := Elora professes Sunry's innocence. She claims that this is some sort of frame-up by someone who wants to get revenge on him. Sunry was an old war hero against the Sith, so they might harbor him ill...

Under pressure Elora confessed that Sunry had been having an affair with the Sith woman Elassa, but that he had been going there to end the affair.
32646 := Elora professes Sunry's innocence. She claims that this is some sort of frame-up by someone who wants to get revenge on him. Sunry was an old war hero against the Sith, so they might harbor him ill...

You have heard rumors that Sunry may have been cheating on his wife... Perhaps you should ask Elora about this.
32647 := Enter the Sith Academy
32648 := In order to get inside the Sith academy in Dreshdae, you will have to be approved by one of the Sith as a worthy "hopeful". The one who does the deciding is a Twi'lek by the name of Yuthura Ban, apparently.
32649 := In order to get inside the Sith academy in Dreshdae, you will have to be approved by one of the Sith as a worthy "hopeful". The one who does the deciding of which hopefuls make it is a Twi'lek Sith Master by the name of Yuthura Ban. She can reportedly be sometimes found in colony's cantina.
32650 := You have spoken to the Sith Master Yuthura Ban, but she is not yet convinced that you are worthy to allow into the academy. She did mention that if one of the other Sith accepted you and gave you a medallion she might change her mind.
32651 := You have convinced Yuthura Ban to accept you into the Sith academy on Korriban. She will take you inside to meet the academy's Master as soon as you are ready.
32652 := You have acquired one of the Sith medallions. Presenting this to the Sith Master Yuthura Ban might prove that you are worthy of entering the Sith academy here on Korriban.
32653 := You have heard that when a Sith accepts a hopeful as worthy they are given a medallion... which must then be presented to Yuthura Ban, the Sith Master who decides which hopefuls enter the academy. She can be found in the colony's cantina.
32654 := You have acquired one of the Sith medallions. Presenting this to the Sith Master Yuthura Ban might prove that you are worthy of entering the Sith academy here on Korriban. She can be found in the colony's cantina.
32655 := Escaping Taris
32656 := Bastila has been found, but you still have no way to escape Taris. Not only do you need the departure codes to get pass the Sith blockade surrounding Taris, you also need to find a ship. You're probably going to need help from one of the locals to get off the planet.
32657 := Canderous Ordo, a Mandalorian mercenary working for Davik will help you get off the planet if you break into the Sith military base and recover the planetary departure codes. A T3 droid could get you past the security doors, but it'll take more than that to deal with the Sith troopers inside.
32658 := With the departure codes you recovered from the Sith base and a fast ship you should be able to escape Taris. Canderous Ordo claims he can get access to the Ebon Hawk, Davik Kang's flagship so you can all get off the planet. The only question is whether you can trust him or not...
32659 := As promised, Canderous got you inside Davik's estate. The Taris crime lord gave you a tour of his facilities, including the hangar where the Ebon Hawk is stored. All you have to do now is find the codes to disable the Hawk's security systems. 
32660 := You've managed to escape Taris just in time, though there was nothing you could do to stop the Sith from razing the entire surface of the planet. The casualties are likely to climb well into the millions; further evidence of Malak's ruthlessness and just one more reminder of why the Sith must be stopped.
32661 := Fair Trade
32662 := The Jawas are in need of someone to help rescue members of their tribe. Speak with their leader Iziz, by the gates out of Anchorhead.
32663 := Iziz has asked that you help rescue members of his tribe from the Sand People enclave. He will reward you well for any help given.
32664 := Iziz says he knows where the Star Map is, and will trade you the information for help rescuing his tribe members from the Sand People enclave.
32665 := The Jawas held captive in the Sand People enclave were very glad for your help, and have promised that their leader Iziz will reward you when you return to the gates inside Anchorehead.
32666 := You have found some captive Jawas within the Sand People enclave, but releasing them without the cheiftain's permission could be a bad idea.
32667 := The Sand People chieftain has given you permission to release the Jawas they currently hold captive.
32668 := Iziz was very grateful for your help in rescuing his tribe members from the Sand People enclave.
32669 := Iziz gave you some information about the Star Map. He said it may be in the Eastern Dune Sea, in a cavern currently occupied by a krayt dragon.
32670 := Finding Dustil
32671 := You ran into an old friend of Carth's... who stunned Carth with the news that he had seen Carth's son, Dustil. The only hitch seems to be that Dustil has joined the Sith. He is a student at the Sith academy on Korriban. Carth has urged you to go there at the earliest opportunity.
32672 := Carth's son has been found, but the reunion was not exactly what he'd hoped. Dustil does not believe anything Carth has to say on the true nature of his new "family". Carth is desperate to find some kind of proof in the academy that the Sith are evil and bring it to Dustil to open his eyes.
32673 := Carth's son has been found, but the reunion was not exactly what he'd hoped. Dustil does not believe anything Carth has to say on the true nature of his new "family". You have found a datapad belonging to the master of the academy which Carth believes will be proof of the Sith's true nature. He wants to return to Dustil as soon as possible with it.
32674 := Dustil's eyes have been opened to the true nature of the Sith. He has determined that he will stay on Korriban and try to both save some of his friends as well as unearth more information. While it's obvious that not everything is patched up between the two of them, they did agree to meet again after events calm and try to make up for some lost time.
32675 := Carth's son was found. Dustil was an angry young man... a Sith in training who blamed Carth for abandoning him and his mother to their fate. Carth tried to argue his case, but Dustil simply grew angrier and eventually attacked. Carth blames you now for Dustil's death, saying that you could have done something to help.
32676 := Firith Me the Pazaak Player
32677 := Firith was staying at the hotel when the murder occurred. He claims he saw nothing and that that's all you'll get out of him.
32678 := Firith told you he once brushed up against Elassa and her cloak fell open to reveal that she was carrying a lightsaber - the mark of a Jedi! It would seem that Elassa may have been a Dark Jedi allied with the Sith.
32679 := Gluupor the Rodian
32680 := Gluupor was staying in one of the rooms of the hotel when the murder took place. He says that he had nothing to do with the crime, ESPECIALLY not with anything in Elassa's room.
32681 := Gluupor confessed that the Sith made him plant the medal as evidence against Sunry after the murder occurred. It would seem that the Sith are indeed trying to point blame at Sunry.
32682 := Handon's Story
32683 := Handon Guld claimed that he was out running as part of his constitutional - due to an aversion to speeders - when he heard a shot and came upon the body. He says that Rickard Lusoff came out of the rocks to the south of the bridge holding a gun. He was the one who reported the murder.

He says that he had very limited knowledge of Calder, but he had recently found out that his wife had been cheating on him with Calder.
32684 := Handon Guld claimed that he was out running as part of his constitutional - due to an aversion to speeders - when he heard a shot and came upon the body. He says that Rickard Lusoff came out of the rocks to the south of the bridge holding a gun. He was the one who reported the murder.

He says that he had very limited knowledge of Calder, but he had recently found out that his wife had been cheating on him with Calder.

Handon has identified the blaster found near the body as his, which had been stolen from him a while ago.
32685 := Hidden Hunters
32686 := This note from a dying Wookiee in the Shadowlands says that his hunting party was attacked by outsiders using camouflage. They were different from the Czerka, and only attacked when his group put their weapons away, obviously wanting weak prey.
32687 := The injured Wookiee Grrrwahrr's hunting party was attacked by camouflaged outsiders. He would reward you for killing the leader of the group. They found bodies a short way southwest, and then further south once past the west branch of the path. He said look where the bodies of his fellows are. The outsiders only appeared once Grrrwahrr's group had put their weapons away, obviously wanting their prey as weak as possible. Disarming may be the only way to flush them out.
32688 := A group of Mandalorians is preying on creatures in the Shadowlands. A datapad mentioned "blending fields" powered by swoops. This undoubtedly provides some form of camouflage.
32689 := You have killed the leader of the Mandalorians hunting in the Shadowlands.
32690 := You have killed the leader of the Mandalorians hunting in the Shadowlands. The injured Wookiee Grrrwahrr will be pleased his fallen comrades have been avenged.
32691 := Grrrwahrr rewarded you for avenging the fallen members of his hunting party.
32692 := A group of Mandalorians is in the Shadowlands training new recruits and attacking unarmed creatures. They also have camouflage generators on their swoops to further sway odds in their favor.
32693 := HK-47
32694 := The deeper functions of HK-47's memory core require some sort of stimulus in order to restore themselves, and HK-47 thinks it is unwise to tamper with this, but other parts of the core might be restored. It would simply take someone of sufficient technical skill in order to do so.
32695 := Successful tampering with HK-47's memory core has recovered the droid's memory of his most recent owner. The dissolution of the owner's company and auctioning of its assets must be how HK-47 ended up in the droid shop on Tatooine. How the droid got to the executive, however, is unknown.
32696 := Memories of HK-47's owner prior to the corporate executive have been recovered. The death of that owner shut HK-47 down... and eventually his wife unwittingly sold the droid to the executive. How the senator acquired HK-47 is unknown.
32697 := It appears that prior to the senator, HK-47 was owned by a feared gangster on Sleheyron known as Bochaba the Hutt. After Bochaba died, another gangster apparently sold the droid to the senator. HK-47 wasn't built on Sleheyron, however, so how he came into the Hutt's possession is unknown.
32698 := Prior to the Hutt, it appears that HK-47 was owned by a Mandalorian soldier. This is the last of HK-47's retrievable memories, however, and it seems the chain is still not complete... HK-47 had been on an assassination mission in Mandalorian space when he was damaged, but does not know who had originally sent him. Unless the stimuli to restore his deeper core is discovered, the details may never be known.
32699 := It seems the mystery of HK-47 has finally been solved. The person who sent the droid on his original assassination mission was... you. HK-47 was a Sith assassination droid and the personal bodyguard of Darth Revan. Against all odds, HK-47 returned to his master without even knowing it.
32700 := Honest Debt
32701 := The merchant Eli Gand is holding Matton Dasol as an indentured servant. Matton's crew apparently left Kashyyyk under cover of night to avoid paying a repair dept to Eli. Standard business practice, it seems.
32702 := The scrambled memory of the malfunctioning droid found in the Shadowlands reveals the violent last moments of its companions. Someone named Eli ambushed the group, and the victims also mentioned an absent comrade named Matton. Some sort of disputed debt may have sparked the incident. If it could be salvaged from the droid, this recording might be of interest to someone.
32703 := The scrambled memory of the malfunctioning droid found in the Shadowlands reveals the violent last moments of its companions. They were ambushed, but identified their attacker as Eli, the merchant you met on docking ring. It appears he has not told the truth about these creditors that supposedly skipped-out on paying him. If it could be salvaged from the droid, Matton would likely be very interested in this recording.
32704 := Matton was interested in the malfunctioning droid in the Shadowlands, but Eli said it was just rumor and put a stop to the conversation. Some sort of salvaged physical evidence would be needed to press the matter further.
32705 := Matton was outraged that Eli would be so devious, and has reacted with understandable violence.
32706 := Matton was grateful that the truth about what happened to his crew was revealed and that Eli was exposed as a thief and a murderer. He'll try to put this treachery behind him.
32707 := Matton was grateful that Eli was exposed as a thief and a murderer. Because of your prodding, Matton will make sure that he is never so weak again. This incident has certainly tainted him.
32708 := The newfound courage of the Wookiees has put a premature end to whatever business Matton and Eli had between them.
32709 := Ignus the Hotel Owner
32710 := Ignus is the proprietor of the hotel that the murder of Elassa occurred at. He told you that he heard the blaster shot go off, then saw Sunry hobbling away from the scene of the crime.
32711 := You have managed to persuade Ignus, the hotel owner, to tell the court that he saw Sunry leaving before the shot went off.
32712 := Infected Outcasts
32713 := Several of the Outcasts have been infected with the rakghoul disease. They have been placed in quarantine away from the others so that when they transform into rakghouls they won't ravage the rest of the village.
32714 := A number of the infected Outcasts have already transformed into rakghouls, it's too late for them. But there are others who could be saved if someone were to administer the rakghoul serum to counteract their disease.
32715 := You have cured the infected Outcasts of the rakghoul disease, and they have been welcomed back into the village.
32716 := Inside the Vulkar Base
32717 := You're inside the Vulkar base, but you still have to locate the prototype accelerator. It's probably stored somewhere off the main level, under heavy guard.
32718 := The prototype accelerator is stored in the basement, but the only way down is through a security elevator in the back of the Vulkar base. You'll need a pass card to use the elevator, unless you can disable the security cannons protecting it.
32719 := You've successfully shut down the thermal security system protecting the elevator to the garage level of the Vulkar base. Now all you have to do is go down there and find the prototype accelerator... and deal with any angry Vulkars you might meet along the way.
32720 := You've found the prototype accelerator and, not surprisingly, it was under heavy guard by a Twi'lek named Kandon Ark, Brejik's right-hand man.
32721 := You've reactivated the heating system in the Vulkar base. The rapid increase in temperature is sure to play havoc with any sensitive, thermal based security equipment.
32722 := Investigate Ruins
32723 := The Jedi Council has ordered you to investigate some strange ruins on Dantooine. It would seem that this is one of the places Revan and Malak visited when they were on the planet, and it may hold some key to their fall.
32724 := You have encountered an ancient droid in these ruins, which purports to be a remanent of a vast, ancient, galaxy-spanning civilization. What happened to this civilizations of 'Builders' and what else lies deeper in the ruins you do not know.

You have also found the fate of the Jedi who had been sent to investigate earlier. It would seem he had been slain...
32725 := You have solved the puzzles of the ancient Builder computers and were able to open the doors deeper in the ruins. In the chamber beyond you found an ancient Star Map with several locations marked on it.

Bastila believes that Revan and Malak followed this map and it led them to the 'Star Forge' which somehow affected them. You should return to the Council and tell them of your findings.
32726 := Jagi's Challenge
32727 := Canderous was approached by a man who had fought under him a long time ago. A man named Jagi.

Jagi claims that Canderous had abandoned and betrayed his own men and seeks vengeance. He has called Canderous to duel with him in the Dune Seas of Tatooine or be forever outcast in the eyes of his fellow Mandalorians. Canderous seems eager to meet this challenge.
32728 := Canderous and Jagi fought in the Dune Sea. Jagi was expecting that you would accompany Canderous, so he had brought friends of his own.

In the end you were able to defeat them, and Jagi was slain. Canderous was oddly affected by this.
32729 := Jagi didn't have to fight Canderous, and you tried to persuade him not to. The Mandalorian sense of honor, however, would not let him live having done what he has.

Jagi took his own life in the Dune Sea. This has deeply affected Canderous.
32730 := Jedi Trials
32731 := The Jedi Council on Dantooine has decided to train you in the ways of the ancient Jedi Order. After much initial training, your first task will be to learn the precepts of the Jedi Code. This code is the path by which all Jedi should lead their lives.
32732 := Having completed the first trial, your second task to become a Jedi is to speak to Master Dorak and determine what sort of path within the Order you wish to follow.
32733 := Having completed the first trial, your second task to become a Jedi is to speak to Master Dorak and determine what sort of path within the Order you wish to follow.

You have received your lightsaber crystal and become a Jedi Guardian. You must return to Master Zhar and complete your training.
32734 := Having completed the first trial, your second task to become a Jedi is to speak to Master Dorak and determine what sort of path within the Order you wish to follow.

You have received your lightsaber crystal and become a Jedi Sentinel. You must return to Master Zhar and complete your training.
32735 := Having completed the first trial, your second task to become a Jedi is to speak to Master Dorak and determine what sort of path within the Order you wish to follow.

You have received your lightsaber crystal and become a Jedi Consular. You must return to Master Zhar and complete your training.
32736 := You must cleanse a meditation grove to the southeast of the dark taint that has been infesting it. The exact nature of the cause of the taint has not been made clear.
32737 := The young Cathar apprentice Juhani is the source of the dark taint permeating the meditation grove. She has fallen to the dark side... although, perhaps not as completely as she believes.
To remove the taint and complete the final trial, you must convince her to release dark feelings... or destroy her and remove the taint forever.
32738 := You have slain the fallen Jedi Padawan Juhani, and removed the dark taint from the meditation grove.
32739 := You have redeemed the fallen Jedi Padawan Juhani, and removed the dark taint from the meditation grove.
32740 := Juhani has been accepted back into the Enclave while the Council debates her case. It seems that redemption can come even to those who have fallen so far.
32741 := You have completed the final stages of your training and have been accepted into the Jedi Order as a Padawan.
32742 := Jolee Bindo
32743 := You and Jolee have talked a little about his past. You may continue the conversation with him in the future, perhaps once you have gained some more experience.
32744 := You prodded Jolee in an effort to find out why he decided to come with you. In the end, he did mention his 'adventuring days'. Perhaps you could ask him about them later, once you gain more experience.
32745 := You got Jolee to talk a little about his adventuring days... and during his tale he mentioned the fact that he had a wife. He didn't want to talk about her, but you might be able to ask him about it later once you gained more experience.
32746 := Jolee talked a little bit about his wife and why he didn't agree with the Jedi credo that love should be forbidden. He spoke of the Jedi with a great deal of bitterness, in fact. You might be able to ask him about it later, once you gained more experience.
32747 := You successfully got Jolee to talk about the Jedi, and he told a tale about how they are often less than perfect. He might talk some more if you ask later, once you've gained more experience.
32748 := Jolee talked about the Sith and mentioned that he had been involved in the Sith War involving the infamous Dark Jedi, Exar Kun. It was obviously an unpleasant memory for him, however, and he told you to ask him about it later when you gained more experience.
32749 := You successfully convinced Jolee to talk about the Sith War, how his wife turned to the dark side... and how he ultimately abandoned the order for not holding him as responsible for her actions as he held himself. You might be able to ask him more about his past a little later, once you have gained more experience.
32750 := You asked Jolee a little about his time on Kashyyyk. You can ask him more about it later, once you've gained more experience.
32751 := You've dragged more out of Jolee about his past than he probably intended... and he has no more tales to tell you, for now. Perhaps once your mission is complete and your destiny finally realized you can talk more.
32752 := For some reason, Jolee isn't about to talk to you anymore. He will accompany you on your mission, but his thoughts and his story are his own.
32753 := Jolee's Request
32754 := Jolee has offered to join with you and help "remove barriers from your path", but he first wants you to remove a group of Czerka poachers from the Shadowlands, northeast of his camp.
32755 := You have decided to harvest tach for a group of Czerka poachers in the Shadowlands, the same group that Jolee wants removed. It is likely he won't be pleased.
32756 := Jolee has offered to join with you and help "remove barriers from your path", but he first wants you to remove the Czerka poachers from the Shadowlands northeast of his camp. He was not pleased that you had agreed to help them hunt.
32757 := You have removed the poachers as Jolee requested. He will now show you how to go deeper into the Shadowlands.
32758 := Largo's Bounty
32759 := A merchant named Largo owes a large sum of money to Davik Kang. Because he is unable to pay the debt, Largo has gone into hiding. In response, Davik has put an illegal bounty on his head.
32760 := Out of the goodness of your heart, you've given Largo the money to pay Davik back, likely saving the poor man's life.
32761 := You returned to Zax to collect the posted bounty for Largo's death. The hapless merchant's fate will serve as a grim reminder of what happens to people who borrow money from Davik Kang and can't pay it back.
32762 := Manaan Swoop Races
32763 := Swoop races on Manaan are open to anyone willing to pay the 100 credit racing fee. There are three rounds of races to compete in.
32764 := You have spoken to Queedle, an amateur racer on Manaan. He needs money to upgrade his swoop so he can compete with the professional racers.
32765 := You have given Queedle some credits to upgrade his swoop. Once he has had some time to upgrade his bike, he will be able to compete against the professional racers.
32766 := Queedle has won the swoop races on Manaan, becoming Sector Champion. He has surprised everyone, and greatly increased the level of competition.
32767 := You have beaten the first round of races on Manaan.
32768 := You have beaten the second round of races on Manaan.
32769 := The current champion of the Manaan races has told you that you should give up racing. He has promised a violent reward for anyone that beats his time.
32770 := You have beaten the third round of races on Manaan, and become Sector Champion.
32771 := You beat his first round time, so Queedle has decided to quit racing. Whether it was time or money, he thinks he just doesn't have what it takes to compete with the professionals.
32772 := The race organizer on Manaan says that current Sector Champion Hukta Jax wants to speak with you before you do another official race.
32773 := Mandalorian Raiders
32774 := You have heard that bands of Mandalorian raiders have been harassing the settlers on Dantooine.
32775 := Jon has told you of the attacks by the raiders that killed his daughter. He has begged you to find them and destroy them. If they are destroyed, then they won't bother the settlers anymore... but it could be dangerous.
32776 := You have encountered some of the Mandalorian raiders plaguing Dantooine and slain them. They did not seem as organized or as powerful as you had been led to believe. Perhaps you have not yet met their most powerful members...
32777 := You have met and slain the Mandalorian leader, Sherruk. He liked to collect lightsabers, and surely would have taken yours, and your head, had you not slain him.

Jon would surely like to hear of this, and should reward you as well.
32778 := Jon has thanked you for slaying the leader of the Mandalorian raiders. Perhaps now the settlers can live their lives without fear.
32779 := Matrik's Bounty
32780 := Davik Kang has put out an illegal bounty on a former associate named Matrik who turned state's evidence against Davik and the Exchange.
32781 := Matrik thinks he can escape his bounty by faking his own death. He's asked you to bring him a permacrete detonator. He plans to set off an explosion in his apartment in the hope that Davik will believe he perished in the blast.
32782 := Matrik's apartment is nothing but a pile of charred rubble, and Matrik himself has vanished into the wind. If the plan works and people really do believe Matrik is dead, then you can probably still collect his bounty from Zax.
32783 := Zax gladly paid you the bounty on Matrik's head, so it seems the plan to fake Matrik's death was a success.
32784 := By completing the bounty on Matrik's head, you further strengthened Davik's hold on the hearts and minds of the people on Taris. Thanks to you, it will be a long, long time before anyone ever dares to testify against the Exchange again.
32785 := Middleman
32786 := A distraught woman outside Fazza's hunting lodge needs someone to buy a wraid plate from her.
32787 := You have paid the woman outside Fazza's lodge for the wraid plate. She was very grateful.
32788 := You have paid the woman outside Fazza's lodge for the wraid plate, offering more than she was asking. She was extremely grateful for your kindness.
32789 := You have paid the woman outside Fazza's lodge for the wraid plate, offering half what she was asking. She was unimpressed, but had no other choice.
32790 := You have convinced the woman outside Fazza's to give you the wraid plate so you can sell it for her and bring her back the money.
32791 := You have made it clear to the woman outside Fazza's that you will not be paying her for the wraid plate she entrusted to you. There was nothing she could do about it.
32792 := You have taken the wraid plate from the woman outside Fazza's. She could do nothing to stop you.
32793 := Missing Companion
32794 := You have met Elise Montagne, who has lost her... companion. Her droid companion.

It is all that she has left of her late husband, and she wishes you to find him. He was apparently kidnapped from her home, and she has been searching for him ever since. She misses him VERY much.
32795 := The droid that fled from Elise, C8-42, ran away because he feared his mistress was spending too much time focused on him, and not enough on other living beings. He wished you to destroy him to force her to live a real life. You obliged him.
32796 := The droid that fled from Elise, C8-42, ran away because he feared his mistress was spending too much time focused on him, and not enough on other living beings. He wished you to destroy him to force her to live a real life. You could not and convinced him to return to her.
32797 := The droid that fled from Elise, C8-42, ran away because he feared his mistress was spending too much time focused on him, and not enough on other living beings. He wished you to destroy him to force her to live a real life. You decided it would be much more fun to destroy him, and convince Elise that he had got away.
32798 := You told Elise that her droid had been destroyed. She was devastated.

She ran off towards the Jedi Enclave.
32799 := You met Elise and C8-42 back near the Enclave. Elise was overjoyed that you returned her droid to her, and thanked you profusely.

C8-42 was a little less... enthusiastic.
32800 := You met Elise in the Jedi Enclave. It turns out that not everything had ended badly after the destruction of her droid.
She met a man named Samnt, and they appear quite interested in each other. Perhaps she can lead a normal, happy life yet.
32801 := You fooled Elise into thinking that her droid was still out there, so she flew off after him. Maybe she'll realize what happened... in a year or two.
32802 := Missing Selkath
32803 := You have been approached by a Selkath named Shaelas. He claims that many young Selkath have been going missing, including his daughter Shasa. He wishes to hire you to find out what has been happening to them.
32804 := You have been approached by a Selkath named Shaelas. He claims that many young Selkath have been going missing, including his daughter Shasa. He wishes to hire you to find out what has been happening to them.

You have discovered that the Sith have been hiring mercenaries to lure the young Selkath into their base for some questionable purpose. More answers would seem to lie inside the Sith Embassy.
32805 := You have found the young Selkath that were missing. They have been taken by the Sith and given some training in the dark arts. It was most unfortunate that you had to kill all of them. Maybe Shaelas will understand...
32806 := You have found the young Selkath that were missing. They have been taken by the Sith and given some training in the dark arts. You congratulated them on their good sense and they now seem to respect you.
32807 := You have found the young Selkath that were missing. They have been taken by the Sith and given some training in the dark arts. You have tried to convince them to return to the light side, but they won't budge. It will take some sort of proof to show them how evil the Sith really are...
32808 := You have managed to convince Shasa and the other Selkath that the Sith were only using them to gain control of Manaan. They have forsaken their dark ways and returned to the city.
32809 := You have told Shaelas that you had to kill his daughter. He is most upset, but understands that you did what needed to be done. He is sure to report to the Ahto City authorities what the Sith are doing.
32810 := You have told Shaelas that his daughter has gone over to the Sith. He is very distraut at this news, and is sure to report this to the Ahto City authorities.
32811 := You have told Shaelas what had been happening to Shasa and the other Selkath youths. He has thanked you profusely. He will report the criminal activities of the Sith to the Ahto City authorities and they will decide what sort of punishment the Sith Empire will receive.
32812 := Mission for the Republic
32813 := You have spoken to Roland Wann, the representative of the Republic Embassy on Manaan. He says that he may have information about the Star Map, but will only tell you what he knows if you retrieve the remains of a Republic Probe droid lost recently to the Sith. The droid has sensitive data recordings of its mission outside of Ahto City and the Republic wants it back before the Sith are able to decrypt it. To do this, you will need to enter the Sith Embassy.

He has said that there are 3 ways to get into the Sith base:

1) You can interrogate a Sith prisoner who was found snooping around the Republic Embassy. He knows a pass code that allows him entry to the Sith base.

2) You can decrypt some captured sith passcards and use them to open the door to the base.

3) You can use the key Roland gave you and force your way into the Sith controlled hangar and fly outside Ahto City into the Embassy though the rear entrance. The hangar is located at the west end of the Ahto City Docking Bay.

Once you have entered the Sith base, retrieve the data module and return it to Roland.
32814 := You managed to retrieve the encrypted data module from the Sith base. Now you need to return it to Roland Wann so he'll tell you what he may know about a Star Map on this world.
32815 := Roland Wann, the representative of the Republic on Manaan, has told you that the Republic has made a secret base underwater near the source of kolto emissions to study and eventually synthesize kolto. They ran across some mysterious ruins that may be related to the Star Map. Unfortunately, something happened down there at the base, and all contact was lost.

Roland has given you access to a submersible to go down to the base and find out what happened. Hopefully, this will lead to one of the Star Maps as well.
32816 := You have found out that all the Selkath and defensive systems in the station in the Hrakert Rift have gone insane. The station is overrun with mad Selkath and malfunctioning machinery. Somewhere in this base may be a clue to the Star Map.
32817 := There are ancient ruins near the Rift that kolto is harvested from, but there is also some sort of huge firaxan shark out in the water. The two scientists you met, Kono Nolan and Sami, have given you several possible ways of defeating this beast.

Kono says that you should poison it, and has given you a cannister of some sort of blister agent they developed to use against the sharks. By putting it in the harvesting machine and venting it, it will spread through the water and kill the beast which drove the station insane.

Sami thinks that this toxin may contaminate the water or environment. She says that if you cause the machinery to reupture and explode, the beast may go back to its slumber. She says that you need to get the pressure of the harvesting machine's fuel tanks to exactly 4 million sangen. At this pressure the fuel will be extremely unstable and explode.
32818 := You fed the toxin into the machine and killed the giant firaxan shark. Unfortunately, it has had some effect on the kolto and it has now turned black. Hopefully it's only temporary...

You found one of the Star Maps in the ruins it had been guarding.
32819 := You overloaded the fuel tanks for the kolto harvesting machinery and caused it to explode. With the machine gone, the giant firaxan shark lost interest and returned to wherever it had laired.

You found one of the Star Maps in the ruins it had been guarding.
32820 := You told Roland Wann about the giant firaxan shark, the kolto, and what happened at the Hrakert station. He is glad that you managed to save the machinery through your novel use of the toxin. Hopefully now they can send a proper rescue team down to the station and things will get back to normal. Except maybe for the kolto...

At least you managed to get the Star Map.
32821 := You told Roland Wann about the giant firaxan shark, the kolto, and what happened at the Hrakert station. He is glad that the situation has been resolved, but most distressed that you resorted to blowing up the machinery to do it. Hopefully now, though, the Republic will repair their base and things will get back to normal.

At least you managed to get the Star Map.
32822 := Mission's Brother
32823 := You've run into Lena, an old girlfriend of Mission's brother, Griff. Lena informed Mission that it was Griff's idea to leave her behind on Taris when they left. she also mentioned that Griff was on Tatooine, working on the Czerka corp mines. Understandably, Mission is eager to speak with him.
32824 := According to the Czerka rep on Tatooine, Griff was captured during a Sand People raid on one of the mining camps. Whether he is still alive is anyone's guess.
32825 := Mission's brother is free from the clutches of the Sand People, thanks to you. Griff is eager to meet up with his sister again, though what will happen during the reunion remains to be seen.
32826 := You found Griff alive and well and being held prisoner in the Sand People enclave. But his reunion with his long-lost sister was far from a tear filled event. Mission feels Griff deserted her back on Taris. Even so, the humane thing to do would be to set him free if the opportunity presents itself.
32827 := Griff and Mission have been reunited, though Mission is still resentful about Griff deserting her on Taris. Before he left, Griff suggested you stop by the Czerka supply shop on Tatooine to speak with him about a potential job.
32828 := Griff wants you to bring him a tach gland so he can brew up some Tarisian ale to sell to a 'business associate'. He's promised you a healthy reward if you come through for him.
32829 := Griff rushed off to brew up a batch of Tarisian ale to deliver to his business connection. However, the credits he promised you haven't materialized yet. He did say you could meet him later in the Czerka supply shop on Tatooine to collect the debt.
32830 := Due to his own incompetence, Griff's Tarisian ale deal has turned sour. True to form, he's decided he'd rather disappear than face the wrath of his contact at the Exchange. You get the feeling both he and the credits he promised you are gone for good.
32831 := Murdered Settler
32832 := You have been approached by a Jedi, Bolook, who requires your assistance in resolving a complicated crime he has encountered. He hopes your understanding of human nature can clarify the contradictory statements of the witnesses at the scene.
32833 := You have been approached by a Jedi, Bolook, who requires your assistance in resolving a complicated crime he has encountered. Apparently two men, Handon Guld and Rickard Lusoff, were at the scene of the murder of another man, Calder Nettick. Bolook does not understand the contradictory nature of their stories, and has asked for your assistance.

The conclusions you have reached so far:

1) Handon claimed he came upon the body after hearing the shot. Rickard said he was staring into the sun, but must have been lying because of the cloud cover earlier.
32834 := You have been approached by a Jedi, Bolook, who requires your assistance in resolving a complicated crime he has encountered.

The conclusions you have reached so far:

1) Handon claimed he came upon the body after hearing the shot. Rickard said he was staring into the sun, but must have been lying because of the cloud cover earlier.

2) Handon said he was just out running, but is probably lying because all settlers should carry weapons out on the plains and Handon had none. Rickard said he was out hunting iriaz.
32835 := You have been approached by a Jedi, Bolook, who requires your assistance in resolving a complicated crime he has encountered.

2) Handon said he was just out running, but is probably lying because all settlers should carry weapons out on the plains and Handon had none. Rickard said he was out hunting iriaz.

3) Handon lied and said that he had no personal knowledge of Calder, but he had rented a speeder with him several times. Rickard said that he was a business partner of Calder's.
32836 := You have been approached by a Jedi, Bolook, who requires your assistance in resolving a complicated crime he has encountered.

3) Handon lied and said that he had no personal knowledge of Calder, but he had rented a speeder with him several times. Rickard said that he was a business partner of Calder's.

4) Handon had not reported his blaster stolen, and then it turned up at the scene of the crime. Rickard confirmed our records in that it was not Calder's.
32837 := You have been approached by a Jedi, Bolook, who requires your assistance in resolving a complicated crime he has encountered.

Bolook does not understand the contradictory nature of their stories, and has asked for your assistance.

4) Handon had not reported his blaster stolen, and then it turned up at the scene of the crime. Rickard confirmed our records in that it was not Calder's.

5) The blood on the blaster wasn't Calder's. On closer examination, it was determined that Handon had been shot.

32838 := You solved the case, sort of. You rightfully concluded that Handon was the one who actually killed Calder, but you failed to realize that Rickard was also planning Calder's murder. Unfortunately, Rickard was able to get away while you were accusing Handon. Hopefully he can be recaptured.
32839 := You solved the case, sort of. You rightfully concluded that Rickard was at the scene to kill Calder, but you failed to realize that it was Handon who actually did the deed. Unfortunately, Handon escaped while you were accusing Rickard. Hopefully he can be recaptured.
32840 := You've successfully solved the crime by realizing that both men were guilty. Although it was Handon who actually killed Calder, Rickard would have killed him had he arrived a little sooner. The two suspects have both been taken into custody, and Bolook is certain to tell the Jedi Council of your brilliant deductive skills.
32841 := Pazaak Rules
32842 := Basics: The object of the game is to have your face up cards total higher than your opponent's hand without exceeding a total of 20. If a player's total is greater than 20 at the end of a turn (a 'BUST'), the opponent wins the set. A player must win 3 sets to win the match and collect the wager.

Equipment: Pazaak is played with a 40 card main deck made up of 4 of each card numbered 1 through 10, and a side deck of up to 10 cards with values ranging from -6 through +6. 

Rules of Play:
1. Each player draws 4 random cards from their side deck to form their HAND. These cards are available to the player for all the sets of the match. Each hand card can only be played once per match.  
2. The first player draws a card from the main deck and plays it face up to begin their turn.  
3. After drawing a card, a player has the option of playing one of the cards from their hand.  Playing a card from the hand is optional.
4. Only one hand card can be played each turn. REMEMBER: A player's 4 card hand must last through all sets of the match.
5. The player now has the option to STAND or to END TURN. A player who stands cannot draw again or play any more cards from their hand during the set. When one player stands, the opponent can continue to take turns until they either stand or bust. 
6. If a player chooses to end turn they will automatically draw another card at the beginning of their next turn. After one player chooses to stand or end turn, the opponent draws a card to begin their next turn. 
7. Players continue to alternate turns until both players choose to stand, or until one player ends a turn with a total greater than 20 (a 'bust'). 
REMEMBER:  You only lose if you are over 20 at the end of your turn. A player can draw a card from the main deck that puts them over 20, then play a negative card from the 'hand' that brings the total back under 20.    
8. In the case of tie, another set must be played.  No new cards from the side decks are drawn.
9. A player can never have more than nine cards in play during one set.  (This includes cards from the hand as well as cards dealt from the deck.) Once you have nine cards in play you automatically stand.
10. A +/- card played from the side deck must be declared as a positive or negative when played. Once played it cannot be changed.
11. The first player to win 3 sets wins the match and the wager.
32843 := Rakghoul Serum
32844 := Zelka at the Upper City medical center is eager to acquire a sample of the rakghoul serum used by the Sith Undercity patrols. 
32845 := Zelka at the Upper City medical center is eager to acquire a sample of the rakghoul serum used by the Sith Undercity patrols. However, Gurney, Zelka's assistant, mentioned that it might be more profitable if you deliver the serum to Zax in the bounty office in the Lower City cantina.
32846 := You've delivered the rakghoul serum to Zelka. He plans to mass produce it so that it will always be available in his store at a very affordable price for anyone who needs it.
32847 := You've delivered the rakghoul serum to Zax, who will forward it on to Davik so the crime lord can mass produce it and sell it for a substantial profit to those who are sick and desperate enough to pay anything. No doubt Zelka will stock the serum at his store, but the cost will likely be outrageous.
32848 := Rapid Transit System
32849 := STAR WARS Knights of the Old Republic has a rapid transit system to allow you to move quickly through the game. You can access the rapid transit system through your MAP screen.

On the map screen you will see a button that says 'Return to Hideout'. In non-action areas you can use this button to instantly transport you back to the apartment complex where your base is located. In some action areas this button will be disabled.

While in the apartment complex the button on the Map screen will read 'Transit Back'. When pressed you will be transported back to the location where you last used the Return to Hideout function.

Remember: If you leave the area around your hideout, the 'Transit Back' button will switch back to 'Return to Hideout' and you will have to manually walk back to your previous location. 

You should try using the Return to Hideout and Transit Back buttons now, just to see how they work.
32850 := STAR WARS Knights of the Old Republic has a rapid transit system to allow you to move quickly through the game. You can access the rapid transit system through your MAP screen.

On the map screen you will see a button that says 'Return to Hideout'. In non-action areas you can use this button to instantly transport you back to the apartment complex where your base is located. In some action areas this button will be disabled.

32851 := Renegade Sith
32852 := You have been told about some renegade Sith students who disobeyed a direct order given by Master Uthar to execute civilians. It is known that they have not left Korriban and are probably in hiding. Anyone who could eliminate them would likely gain favor with Master Uthar for the deed.
32853 := Having killed the renegade Sith students who were hiding out in the shyrack caverns, you have informed Master Uthar of the deed. He was suitably impressed, bringing you closer to the final test for apprenticeship.
32854 := Even though you had freed the renegade Sith students from the shyrack caverns, you were also able to lie to Master Uthar and inform him that his problem was taken care of. Technically it's true... they *are* gone. Either way, you've earned prestige amongst the Sith for the deed.
32855 := You have encountered a group of renegade Sith students trapped within the shyrack caverns. They are trying to get to the surface to escape the planet, but their route is currently blocked by some type of creature. Getting rid of the creature would enable them to escape, but killing them would earn you prestige.
32856 := You have successfully killed a small group of renegade Sith students that were holed up in shyrack caverns outside of the academy. Reporting this deed to Master Uthar would certainly earn his favor.
32857 := With the creature in the shyrack caverns killed, the renegade Sith students were able to escape to the surface and escape from Korriban.
32858 := Republic Hiring Mercenaries
32859 := The Selkath Nilko is suspicious about the Republic hiring mercenaries. He claims to be a friend of the Republic and is merely seeking to find out if something is wrong. He says he will reward you if you find out why they've been hiring to many lately.
32860 := You told Nilko about the Republic facility in the Hrakert Rift. He thanked you and said he would try to cover for the Republic's actions. It seems that some Selkath, at least, are definitely on the Republic's side.
32861 := Rickard's Story
32862 := Rickard Lusoff claimed that he had been out hunting iriaz shortly before the murder. He claimed that he saw one near the bridge from his location in the rocks to the south and fired. Unfortunately he was partially blinded by the sun. When he came to where it had fallen, he found Handon Guld standing over Calder Nettic's body.

Rickard and Calder were business partner's in a sub-orbital shipping concern. Rickard claims that business had been going well for them, and that he doesn't know why anyone would want to kill him.
32863 := Rickard Lusoff claimed that he had been out hunting iriaz shortly before the murder. He claimed that he saw one near the bridge from his location in the rocks to the south and fired. Unfortunately he was partially blinded by the sun. When he came to where it had fallen, he found Handon Guld standing over Calder Nettic's body.

Rickard and Calder were business partner's in a sub-orbital shipping concern. Rickard claims that business had been going well for them, and that he doesn't know why anyone would want to kill him.

Rickard didn't recognize the blaster that was found near the body, but says that it definitely wasn't Calder's.
32864 := Rogue Droid
32865 := You have been told about a rogue Sith droid that has escaped from the labs and holed itself up in one of the valley's tombs. The Sith have not yet decided to go into the tomb to remove it by force... leaving it to some enterprising Sith hopefuls to take that job upon themselves.
32866 := You encountered a rogue Sith assassin droid within one of the valley's tombs. You were able to deactivate its assassination protocols, for which the droid was grateful. While it left the planet, you're not positive that the act is one that would gain you favor with Master Uthar.
32867 := You encountered a rogue Sith assassin droid within one of the valley's tombs and in the end you were forced to destroy it along with its other droid minions, an act that will surely gain you favor with Master Uthar.
32868 := You have informed Master Uthar of your destruction of the rogue assassin droid in the tombs, an act which impressed him greatly and brought you one step closer to your final test.
32869 := Even though you did not destroy the rogue assassin droid in the tombs, you did get rid of Master Uthar's problem... a lie which he was willing to swallow and give you prestige for. You are now one step closer towards reaching the final test.
32870 := Rukil's Apprentice
32871 := Rukil of the Outcast village has asked you to discover the fate of his missing apprentice, a young woman named Malya. She never returned from a mission Rukil sent her on some time ago, though he refuses to tell you what she was searching for when she left the village.
32872 := You've given Rukil the journal of his missing apprentice, confirming what the old man suspected: she perished while searching for the mythical Promised Land.
32873 := Sand People
32874 := Czerka Corporation has given you permission to enter the Dune Sea on the condition that you stop the Sand People from raiding their mining interests. They want the Sand People chieftain's gaffi stick as proof. 
32875 := The leader of a group of Czerka employees near a damaged sandcrawler said there was a Sand People enclave in the south of the Dune Sea. The Sand People have many captured Czerka weapons, so he suggested you sneak in somehow.
32876 := The leader of a group of Czerka employees near a damaged sandcrawler said there was a Sand People enclave in the south of the Dune Sea. The Sand People have many captured Czerka weapons, including several stolen turrets, so he suggested you sneak in somehow.
32877 := You have acquired Sand People robes. They should allow you to pass yourself off as a Sand People warrior, at least from a distance. They may make entering the Sand People enclave a little easier. All of the non-droid members of your party would have to be wearing the robes for the disguise to work. Since you don't have robes big enough to fit Zaalbar, his presence would certainly give you away.
32878 := Your Sand People robes are no good at short range, but seem to be an effective disguise at a distance. Make sure all the non-droid members of your group are wearing the robes when you approach the enclave. Since you don't have robes large enough to fit Zaalbar, the Wookiee would surely give you away.
32879 := You made it inside the Sand People enclave, having walked past the turrets outside. You'll have to make sure to clear the place out or they will activate the turrets to kill you when you leave.
32880 := You have killed the Sand People chieftain. Find his personal gaffi stick and take it to the Czerka office in Anchorhead.
32881 := You successfully made it into the Sand People enclave, momentarily surprising the guards inside. HK-47 has taken the opportunity to confuse them, communicating in their own dialect. It may allow you to find a peaceful solution to the conflict with Czerka Corporation.
32882 := You have been brought before the Sand People chieftain. He will order the attacks against Czerka Corporation to be scaled back if you bring him moisture vaporators from the Czerka office in Anchorhead. You will not be allowed back inside the enclave until you have the vaporators.
32883 := The Czerka have made it clear they are not interested in a peaceful solution to the Sand People attacks. They want you to kill them all.
32884 := You have purchased two moisture vaporators from the Czerka office. Take them to the Sand People chieftain in the enclave. 
32885 := The Sand People chieftain was surprised that you returned with the vaporators. He will reduce the frequency of attacks against the Czerka, and has given you his gaffi stick as a symbol of the agreement. Take the gaffi to the Czerka office in Anchorhead.
32886 := The short-lived peace with the Sand People has failed. You'll have to kill the lot of them.
32887 := You brought the Sand People chieftain's gaffi to the Czerka office, fulfilling your agreement with them.
32888 := Czerka Corporation has offered to allow you to leave Anchorhead and enter the Dune Sea if you help stop the Sand People from attacking their interests. There is no other way to get permission to enter the Dune Sea.
32889 := You have broken the short-lived peace with the Sand People and will have to acquire the chieftain's gaffi through brute force.
32890 := You have acquired the Sand People chieftain's gaffi stick. Return it to the Czerka office in Anchorhead as proof that you have killed the Sand People in this enclave.
32891 := Sandral-Matale Feud
32892 := Ahlan Matale has approached the Jedi Council and demanded action. He believes that the head of the rival Sandral family, Nurik Sandral, has kidnapped his son. The Jedi Council has decreed that you may investigate the disappearance so long as it does not detract from your main quest.
32893 := You have spoken to Ahlan Matale and he is very adamant about his belief that the Sandrals to the south are behind the disappearance of his son Shen.
32894 := You have spoken to Nurik Sandral and his daughter Rahasia. Nurik denies any involvement in Shen's disappearance, but Rahasia tells another story. She says that her father has captured Shen because he believes that Ahlan has his own son, Casus. Shen is being held in the Sandral estate, and Rahasia has given you a key to the rear entrance so that you may help him escape.
32895 := Shen says that he will not leave the estate so long as Rahasia stays behind. He fears for what her father may do to her once his escape has been discovered. He claims to love her.
32896 := Rahasia has agreed to meet you and Shen outside the estate. Now all that remains is to get him out of here...
32897 := Shen and Rahasia met outside the Sandral estate, but were ambushed by Ahlan Matale. Shortly thereafter, Nurik Sandral showed up as well. You managed to convince both fathers that this match was for the best and Shen and Rahasia are allowed to stay together now. They thanked you profusely and walked off with their families.
32898 := You have spoken to Nurik Sandral and his daughter Rahasia. Nurik denies any involvement in Shen's disappearance. His daughter Rahasia came and tried to speak to you, but you must have said something wrong and now she's sulking.
32899 := Shen and Rahasia met outside the Sandral estate, but were ambushed by Ahlan Matale. Shortly thereafter, Nurik Sandral showed up as well. Unable to reconcile them with their families, Shen and Rahasia fled to the Jedi Enclave where they can live their lives away from their families' poisonous influence.
32900 := Shen and Rahasia met outside the Sandral estate, but were ambushed by Ahlan Matale. Shortly thereafter, Nurik Sandral showed up as well. It seems that their match was not all they had thought it to be, and Shen and Rahasia were separated in the end. Shen went home with his father and it doesn't seem like they'll be getting back together again. A most unsatisying outcome, but expected.
32901 := Shen and Rahasia met outside the Sandral estate, but were ambushed by Ahlan Matale. Shortly thereafter, Nurik Sandral showed up as well. It seems that their match was not all they had thought it to be, and Shen and Rahasia were separated in the end. Shen went home with his father after he realized that he had been foolish to love Rahasia. It does not seem like he will ever return to her, and both fathers are pleased.
32902 := Shen and Rahasia met outside the Sandral estate, but were ambushed by Ahlan Matale. Shortly thereafter, Nurik Sandral showed up as well. In time, the history books may print your part in what followed, but as far as the Council is concerned, both families were uncontrollable and the bloodbath that followed was entirely unavoidable. Tragic, really...
32903 := Selven's Bounty
32904 := There is an official government bounty out on a woman named Selven. She is a known assassin, and there are no leads as to where she may be hiding now.
32905 := Where others have failed you have once again found success in managing to kill the assassin Selven for Zax.
32906 := Signing Nico
32907 := Motta the Hutt wants you to help him bully the young racer Nico into a very restrictive racing contract.
32908 := A young racer named Nico is being bullied into a bad contract with the Hutt running the races on Tatooine.
32909 := Nico won't listen to what you have to say about Motta's contract until you have proven you are as good a racer as he is, and his times are presumably as fast as the Tatooine offical track record.
32910 := You have convinced Nico that he should sign Motta's contract. He was resigned to his fate. Time to collect your fee from Motta.
32911 := You have convinced Motta to give Nico a better contract that will benefit both of them in the long term. Nico will want to express his thanks to you.
32912 := Motta has rewarded you for helping sign Nico to a very restrictive contract.
32913 := Nico has expressed his thanks for securing him a better deal with Motta.
32914 := Star Map: Kashyyyk
32915 := People seem to know nothing about a possible Star Map on Kashyyyk, though much of the planet is unexplored due to the dangers of the Shadowlands. Firsthand exploration may be the only option.
32916 := Wookiee chieftain Chuundar has asked that you descend into the Shadowlands and perform a task for him. This will allow you to also search for the Star Map.
32917 := A repulsor field blocks the passage into the Lower Shadowlands. You will have to find someone who knows how to pass it that is also willing to help you.
32918 := The reclusive Jolee Bindo has offered to remove barriers from your path if you do a task for him and then give him passage off of Kashyyyk. It may be the only way to access the Lower Shadowlands.
32919 := Having the reclusive Jolee Bindo in your group will allow you to access the Lower Shadowlands.
32920 := There is a strange computer in the Lower Shadowlands, northwest of Freyyr, that may hold a clue as to where the Star Map may be found.
32921 := You have acquired the Star Map from the ancient computer on Kashyyyk.
32922 := Star Map: Korriban
32923 := You have heard mention that the Sith are performing excavations on the surface of Korriban in a place they call the "Valley of the Dark Lords". This valley contains ancient ruins and seems to be the most likely location to find the Star Map, though how one might reach it is unknown.
32924 := It seems that only the Sith of the local monastery have access to the ruins on the surface. If you are going to reach them and search for the Star Map it will have to be through the monastery.
32925 := You have heard that there are ancient ruins of unknown origin located on the surface of Korriban. This would be a likely place to start looking for the Star Map, so finding out more about these ruins is a good idea.
32926 := The Star Map on Korriban lies in the tomb of Naga Sadow within the Valley of the Dark Lords. The tomb, however, can only be entered by Master Uthar of the academy. He will take you there for your final test once you succeed in gaining enough prestige... doing so may be your only chance at reaching the Star Map.
32927 := You have found the Star Map from the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban.
32928 := Star Map: Tatooine
32929 := If anyone would know about odd or ancient things on Tatooine, it would have to be the indigenous species. Jawas are hard to understand, however, and Sand People attack everything they see.
32930 := Iziz claims that he knows where the Star Map is. He will trade this information for help in rescuing his tribe from the Sand People.
32931 := The Sand People chieftain claims that there is something like the Star Map in the Eastern Dune Sea, though it is in a cavern now housing a feared krayt dragon.
32932 := There is a krayt dragon in a cavern in the Eastern Dune Sea. The beast will have to be dealt with before any search for the Star Map can be made.
32933 := You have found a map to the Eastern Dune Sea, an area far from civilization. If the Star Map is on Tatooine, it would likely be in a distant, little explored area such as this.
32934 := Iziz has thanked you for helping his people, and now says that the Star Map may be located in a cavern in the Eastern Dune Sea. He warns that the excavation he is speaking of is now the lair of a feared krayt dragon.
32935 := You have acquired the Star Map from the lair of the krayt dragon on Tatooine.
32936 := The krayt dragon has been killed. Whatever might be hidden in the depths of its lair is now yours to claim.
32937 := Strange Stowaway
32938 := You have encountered a young girl on board the Ebon Hawk... obviously a stowaway. The language she speaks, while sounding like Mandalorian, translates into pure gibberish. She may know the language, but she certainly doesn't know how to use it. And yet it seems to be the only language she knows. It might be possible to try talking to her... but dumping her on the planet is also a possibility.
32939 := Problem solved, the easy way: the odd stowaway has been ordered off your ship. It isn't really your problem, after all, is it?
32940 := After considerable effort, you have managed to communicate with the young stowaway... whose name appears to be Sasha... and learned what she was doing aboard the ship. Apparently she was once held by the Mandalorians, long enough to learn their speech but nothing else, and she escaped from them long enough to stow away on the Ebon Hawk and hide. Her original home seems to be Dantooine. Perhaps someone there could help her?
32941 := A Twi'lek who claims to be working for a Dantooine citizen is looking for a young human girl named Sasha... who is likely the same stowaway as the one aboard the Ebon Hawk. He won't come aboard to verify that fact, however. If you are going to coax her off the ship in order to turn her over to the Twi'lek, you're going to have to find some way to communicate with her. It's either that or order her off and wish him well.
32942 := Sasha has been handed over to the Lur Arka, and hopefully is now on her way back to her family. Problem solved. With luck, this will mean less messes in the food stores unless Zaalbar has another one of his late-night cravings.
32943 := Sunry Murder Trial
32944 := You have been approached by Elora, wife of Jolee's friend Sunry. She has begged you to bring Jolee to her so that she may speak to him.
32945 := Elora has told Jolee that her husband has been imprisoned for the murder of a Sith woman. Elora is adamant that her husband is not responsible and has begged you and Jolee to help her prove his innocence. She says that you can talk to the judges in the court to help get him released.
32946 := You have spoken to the judges in the court and they have consented to appoint you Arbiter in this case. As Arbiter you will defend your client to the best of your ability before the judges.

They have given you the following information as well:

Sunry was seen leaving the scene of the murder after a blaster shot was heard. Sunry has noticeable, crippling injuries from his past experience as a war hero against the Sith, so it was definitely him. This is testified to by the proprietor of the hotel where this occurred, Ignus.

In the room that he had rented, a Sith woman, Elassa, was found dead, clutching a Republic war medal in her hand.

There were two witnesses besides the hotel owner. One is Gluupor, a Rodian who was staying in the next room. The other is Firith Me, a gambler who was also staying nearby. Their stories seem to corroborate Ignus'.
32947 := As Arbiter you must defend Sunry to the best of your ability. However, you have found a data recording that clearly shows Sunry killing the Sith woman Elassa. Can you continue your role of Arbiter impartially, knowing that you client has committed such a crime?
32948 := You have presented the data recording of Sunry killing Elassa to the court and they have summarily found Sunry guilty as charged. Due to the nature of the crime, the death sentence has been decreed. Justice has been served.
32949 := You have failed in your efforts to prove Sunry's innocence. The court has found him guilty as charged. Due to the tensions between the Sith and the Republic at the present time, though, they have decided to waive the death penalty and merely sentence him to life imprisonment. Justice has been served, after a fashion.
32950 := You have managed to convince the Selkath court that Sunry is innocent of his crime. Sunry and Elora both thanked you profusely. They say they'll be heading off-world as soon as possible to get somewhere more peaceful.
32951 := You have managed to convince the Selkath court that Sunry is innocent of his crime. Sunry and Elora both thanked you profusely. They say they'll be heading off-world as soon as possible to get somewhere more peaceful.

In addition, you proved that the Sith were guilty of trying to frame Sunry. The Ahto City authorities have imposed additional sanction on the Sith in the form of subsidies towards kolto purchases. This should make things easier in the future.
32952 := Sunry's Story
32953 := Sunry claims that he's been set up by someone to take the fall for Elassa's murder. He claims that he was secretly trying to turn her into a double agent for the Republic and that the Sith most likely killed her as a result of that.
32954 := Sunry has admitted that he was having an affair with Elassa, but that he was going there to end it. He said he truly loved and never would have harmed her.
32955 := Confronted with the evidence of the recording of him killing Elassa, Sunry admitted to his crime. He refuses to confess to the court, however. He says he will not betray the Republic or harm it because of what happened.
32956 := Tach Poaching
32957 := Poachers in the Shadowlands have made an offer. They want you to help harvest tach, small creatures that possess a gland that can be used as a stimulant.
32958 := The poachers Jolee wants removed have made an offer. They want you to help harvest tach, small creatures that possess a gland that can be used as a stimulant. It is doubtful Jolee would approve.
32959 := You have decided to harvest tach for a group of Czerka poachers in the Shadowlands.
32960 := The poachers have been removed from the Shadowlands. Jolee will join with you now.
32961 := Tanis Trapped
32962 := Tanis, a wraid hunter, is stuck in the desert, the victim of a trap laid by his estranged wife. His four droids have surrounded him, and unless someone repairs them, they will explode when he moves.
32963 := Three more of Tanis' droids need to be repaired before he can safely move.
32964 := Three of Tanis' droids need to be repaired before he can safely move. One has already self-destructed.
32965 := Two more of Tanis' droids need to be repaired before he can safely move.
32966 := Two more of Tanis' droids need to be repaired before he can safely move. One has already self-destructed.
32967 := One more of Tanis' droids needs to be repaired before he can safely move.
32968 := One more of Tanis' droids needs to be repaired before he can safely move. One has already self-destructed.
32969 := Tanis has been rescued from the trap laid by his estranged wife.
32970 := Tanis has been killed in the trap set by his estranged wife.
32971 := Taris: Planetary Information
32972 := Taris is a sharply divided world. The rich live in the Upper City, while the Lower City is run by swoop gangs. The lowest levels of Taris are overrun by terrible monsters called rakghouls. To make matters worse, the Sith have seized control and imposed a planet-wide quarantine.
32973 := Taris has been reduced to a desolate wasteland of rubble and permacrete dust. No doubt a few citizens survived the Sith assault on the planet, though any survivors are likely to seek shelter in the regions beneath the surface, making it virtually impossible to locate them.
32974 := Tatooine Swoop Racing
32975 := You have signed up for the swoop races on Tatooine. Motta the Hutt runs the races and will keep track of your times.
32976 := You have won the first tier of races on Tatooine.
32977 := You have won the second tier of races on Tatooine.
32978 := You are now champion of the swoop track on Tatooine, having won all three official time tiers.
32979 := The Code of the Sith
32980 := Yuthura has instructed you on the Code of the Sith. Master Uthar already stated that the first hopeful to come to him with full knowledge of the Code could gain prestige. If you take it to him, make sure you remember it well.
32981 := You did not learn the Code of the Sith well enough to impress Master Uthar. You will have to find other ways to gain prestige.
32982 := You were successful in demonstrating to Master Uthar your knowledge of the Code of the Sith. He was impressed, and you have gained prestige, though you will no doubt have to do much more than this to prove your final worth.
32983 := The Double-Cross
32984 := Yuthura Ban has chosen you to be part of her plot to overthrow Master Uthar and take over the academy... and she didn't give you much choice in the matter. Yuthura will help you gain enough prestige to be worthy of the final test at the tomb of Naga Sadow, and there she expects you to help her kill Master Uthar.
32985 := Yuthura has given you a small device which she says will secretly poison Master Uthar. It must be placed within his bed inside his chambers, for which she has given you a passcard to enter. Regardless of whether or not you do as she wishes, Master Uthar should not be told about your relaying of his plan... no doubt he would not look upon you kindly.
32986 := You have placed Yuthura's device in Master Uthar's bed, meaning he should be poisoned in time for the final test at the tomb of Naga Sadow. This should make him much easier to defeat there. Hopefully Master Uthar does not find out about your involvement in the scheme before that time comes.
32987 := The Double-Double-Cross
32988 := Master Uthar has co-opted you into his own plan to turn the tables around on Yuthura. He has given you a datapad with instructions to have Yuthura poisoned in time for the final test. You must locate Adrenas in the exit to the Valley of the Dark Lords and give the datapad to him.
32989 := You have turned over Master Uthar's datapad to Yuthura, effectively eliminating any possibility of her being poisoned. It would probably not be a good idea to reveal this particular detail to Master Uthar.
32990 := Master Uthar's datapad has been turned over to Adrenas. This means that when (and if) you go to the final test at the tomb of Naga Sadow, Yuthura will be poisoned and weak enough to be easily defeated.
32991 := You have informed Yuthura about the poison that Master Uthar intends to use on her, ultimately nullifying the effect his plot will have. It would probably not be a good idea to reveal this particular detail to Master Uthar.
32992 := The Droid's Story
32993 := The information retrieval droid has given you the following information (stored in your datapad):

Analysis of the body indicates that the time of death was within the last 3 hours.

There was a reported connection between Calder and Handon in the form of several speeder rentals recently.

Rickard was involved in a public disturbance involving Calder in which he accused Calder of cheating him out of money.

There have been numerous kath hound attacks recently and a general warning went out to all settlers that they should carry weapons with them at all times when out on the plains.
32994 := The information retrieval droid has given you the following information (stored in your datapad):

Analysis of the body indicates that the time of death was within the last 3 hours.

There was a reported connection between Calder and Handon in the form of several speeder rentals recently.

Rickard was involved in a public disturbance involving Calder in which he accused Calder of cheating him out of money.

There have been numerous kath hound attacks recently and a general warning went out to all settlers that they should carry weapons with them at all times when out on the plains.

There is no record of Handon's blaster being reported stolen.
32995 := The information retrieval droid has given you the following information (stored in your datapad):

Analysis of the body indicates that the time of death was within the last 3 hours.

There was a reported connection between Calder and Handon in the form of several speeder rentals recently.

Rickard was involved in a public disturbance involving Calder in which he accused Calder of cheating him out of money.

There have been numerous kath hound attacks recently and a general warning went out to all settlers that they should carry weapons with them at all times when out on the plains.

There is no record of Handon's blaster being reported stolen.

Analysis of the blood sample found on the weapon discovered at the scene of the crime has revealed that the blood is not Calder's.
32996 := The Duel Ring
32997 := You've agreed to join the Taris dueling circuit. The non-lethal duels seem quite popular with the spectators, and you sense the chance for substantial profit. Whenever you want a duel, all you have to do is speak to Ajuur.
32998 := You've claimed your first victory in the dueling ring by defeating Deadeye Duncan. Unfortunately, Duncan's lack of ability is legendary, so hardly anyone is impressed by your victory.
32999 := Gerlon Two-fingers has fallen before you in battle, gaining you some measure of respect among afficionados of the sport, though you are still ranked far below the top ranked duelists.
33000 := With your victory over Ice people are beginning to notice your accomplishments in the ring. If you continue to climb the ranks a championship match is inevitable. 
33001 := By defeating Marl, you've solidly staked your claim among the duel ring's elite. In fact, only one fighter stands between you and the title of duel champion... the crazed Rodian, Twitch.
33002 := Like all the others, Twitch was no match for you in the duel ring. The title of duel champion is yours, by right and by might.
33003 := You are the reigning duel champion on Taris, but only by facing the legendary Bendak Starkiller in a death match can you prove yourself the greatest duelist of all time... unless you end up a smoking corpse in the middle of the ring.
33004 := Bendak Starkiller will face you in an illegal death match. The death match will take Ajuur some time to prepare, giving ample opportunity for news of Bendak's return to spread quickly among the people of Taris. But when the battle is over, it's you the people will be talking about... you hope.
33005 := Bendak is dead, both in the ring and in the minds of the people. Now it is you they talk about: the Mysterious Stranger, the greatest duelist in the history of Taris.
33006 := The Final Confrontation
33007 := With an escort of Jedi snub fighters, you were able to penetrate the Sith defenses and land the Ebon Hawk on the Star Forge itself. Now you have to find and stop Bastila from using her Battle Meditation so the Republic capital ships can attack the Star Forge.
33008 := You tricked an escort of Jedi snub fighters into helping you penetrate the Sith defenses and land the Ebon Hawk on the Star Forge itself. Now you must find and defeat Malak to reclaim the mantle of Sith Master.
33009 := You've saved Bastila from the dark side, and she is now using her Battle Meditation against the Sith fleet.  But you know that the Sith threat will never truly be over unless you find and destroy Malak himself.
33010 := You were unable to save Bastila from the dark side, and in the end you had no choice but to kill her so that the Republic capital ships have a chance to destroy the Star Forge. But you know that the Sith threat will never truly be over unless you find and destroy Malak himself.
33011 := Bastila is using her Battle Meditation to wipe the Republic fleet from the face of the galaxy with a single, glorious victory. This means you will face Malak alone, a final meeting of Master and Apprentice to determine who will be the Dark Lord of the Sith... and ruler of the entire galaxy!
33012 := Malak has come to a violent end, the eventual fate of all who follow the dark side. The Sith fleet is in ruins and the Star Forge itself is all but destroyed; a lifeless hunk of metal tumbling from orbit. You have to get out of here before the space station plunges into the burning heart of this system's sun.
33013 := You have slain Malak and once again rule unchallenged as Lord of the Sith. With the bulk of their fleet smashed, it is only a matter of time until the Republic - and the entire galaxy - is forced to bow down before you!
33014 := The Hermit in the Hills
33015 := You have been told about a mad hermit who can be found in the hills surrounding the Valley of the Dark Lords. Apparently he preys upon unsuspecting academy students, his victims never being seen again. How much of this story is true is unknown, but dealing with the problem might be worthy of prestige.
33016 := You have been told about the "mad hermit" in the hills surrounding the Valley of the Dark Lords. Apparently this hermit is the former master of the academy, Jorak Uln, who was forced into his exile by Master Uthar. The man is mad and a menace to the academy, and dealing with him might be worthy of prestige.
33017 := You encountered Jorak Uln in his lair deep within one of the valley's tombs. He tested you for Sith "purity" and found you suitable enough to release along with a gift: an ancient Sith tablet that included his own translations and musings, certainly something that would earn you prestige with Master Uthar.
33018 := You encountered Jorak Uln in his lair deep within one of the valley's tombs. He tested you for Sith "purity" and you were able to escape his strange tortures and kill him. Reporting his death might be worthy of prestige... but so might bringing to Master Uthar the ancient Sith tablet Jorak mentioned.
33019 := The ancient Sith tablet that included Jorak Uln's own musings has been turned over to Master Uthar, impressing him greatly and bringing you one step closer to your final test.
33020 := The Mandalorian Weapons Cache
33021 := A Sith "information extractor" has been having difficulty getting the location of a secret weapons cache out of a Mandalorian prisoner. He has invited you to try: all you need to do is use the console to inject truth serum. The right amount will make him confess. Too much, however, and the prisoner will go into shock.
33022 := You managed to extract the location of a weapons cache from a Mandalorian prisoner, but the Sith who allowed you to perform the procedure has run off to take credit for the extraction, himself. Perhaps if you make it to Master Uthar first you can gain the prestige, instead.
33023 := You managed to extract the location of a weapons cache from a Mandalorian prisoner... and had to fight the Sith who was present to prevent him from taking credit for himself. Telling Master Uthar of the cache's location is certain to impress him.
33024 := You managed to save a Mandalorian prisoner by rendering him catatonic... his body will be presumed dead and will be dumped, allowing him to escape upon his recovery. He gratefully told you the location of his cache. It is unreachable by you, but its location could be given to Master Uthar in exchange for prestige.
33025 := The location of the Mandalorian prisoner's weapons cache has been turned over to Master Uthar. He says that the cache is no longer of particular interest, but was impressed at your ability to gain the information regardless. You are one step closer towards taking your final test.
33026 := You attempted to extract the location of a weapons cache from a Mandalorian prisoner within the academy, but ended up injecting too much truth serum too fast. This resulted in the prisoner going into shock, which makes him quite useless.
33027 := The Promised Land
33028 := Rukil has offered to tell you the history of the Outcasts who dwell in the Undercity. It seems to have something to do with a prophecy and 'the Promised Land', whatever that may be. You can't help but wonder if the old man is suffering from some type of dementia.
33029 := Rukil believes that with his apprentice's journal and the journals of his father and grandfather he could piece together the clues and discover the location of the promised land. He's asked you to bring the journals to him. 
33030 := The shopkeeper Igear wants you to bring him the missing journals of those who died searching for the Promised Land so he can destroy them. He's also offered to pay you for the journals, something Rukil can't do.
33031 := You've given the journals to Igear, forever condemning Rukil and the other Outcasts to their current grim and hopeless existence. But at least you made a nice profit on the deal.
33032 := The Outcasts have left in a mass exodus, going to seek out the fabled paradise of the Promised Land. The journey will be difficult, but by recovering the journals you've given the Outcasts something they haven't had in a long, long time: hope.
33033 := The Search for Bastila
33034 := You are stranded on Taris, a planet under Sith control. Now you and Carth Onasi must find  Bastila - the only person capable of stopping the Sith from conquering the entire galaxy. You should probably begin by investigating reports of escape pods that crashed into the Undercity.
33035 := Your efforts to search for Bastila in the lower regions of Taris have hit a snag. The Sith guard at the elevator down to the Lower City won't let you past without a Sith uniform or the proper authorization papers.
33036 := Your Sith disguise has fooled the guard at the Upper City elevator, giving you access to the Lower City. Hopefully it will be just as easy to gain access to the Undercity so you can search for signs of Bastila's crashed escape pod.
33037 := The Sith guard in the Lower City refuses to let you into the Undercity without the proper authorization. You'll have to get your hands on some type of pass or papers if you want to explore the Undercity for signs of Bastila's escape pod.
33038 := Gadon Thek, leader of the Hidden Bek swoop gang, will help you get Bastila back if you recover a prototype swoop accelerator stolen by the rival Black Vulkars. He suggested you look for Mission Vao in the Undercity or the sewers to help get you in.
33039 := Mission has agreed to help you sneak into the Black Vulkar base to recover the stolen swoop accelerator. But first, she wants you rescue her Wookiee friend, Zaalbar, from the Gamorrean slavers in the sewers.
33040 := You've saved Zaalbar from the Gamorrean slavers, prompting the Wookiee to swear a life debt to you. And, as promised, Mission has agreed to get you into the Vulkar base. Once inside, you can steal the swoop accelerator and return it to Gadon Thek.
33041 := Kandon Ark, one of the Black Vulkars, has given you a counter to Gadon Thek's offer. He claims that if you kill the Hidden Bek leader, then Brejik and the Black Vulkars will sponsor your entry into the swoop race where Bastila is being offered up as part of the champion's prize.

You now have two choices: kill Gadon and return to the Vulkar base, or take the swoop accelerator back to the Hidden Beks.
33042 := Gadon has entered you as a rider in the swoop race. If you can post the fastest time, you'll win the champion's prize - including Bastila. The Beks are allowing you to ride a bike equipped with the prototype accelerator, giving you a better chance to win the race... if you survive.
33043 := The Black Vulkars have entered you as a rider in the swoop race. If you can post the fastest time, you'll win the champion's prize - including Bastila. The Vulkars are allowing you to ride a bike equipped with the prototype accelerator, giving you a better chance to win the race... if you survive.
33044 := By winning the swoop race, you've managed to secure Bastila's freedom from the Black Vulkars. But neither Bastila nor you will be safe until you find a way to escape the planet. It's obvious your work on Taris is far from done.
33045 := You've met Mission Vao, a young Twi'lek who can get you inside the Black Vulkar base to recover the stolen swoop accelerator. But Mission refuses to help you unless you help rescue her Wookiee friend, Zaalbar, from the Gamorrean slavers in the sewers.
33046 := You've learned that Bastila has been captured by the Black Vulkar swoop gang. However, finding a way into their base to try and rescue her isn't going to be easy.
33047 := The Sword of Ajunta Pall
33048 := You have encountered none other than the restless and regret-filled spirit of the ancient Sith Lord, Ajunta Pall, within his tomb. He has entreated you to find out which of the three swords buried in his sarcophagus is actually his... and to place it on the statue within this chamber. He has left you with this clue: "I am that which grips the heart in fright, hearkens night and silences the light."
33049 := Having selected the wrong sword to place in the statue, the spirit of the Sith Lord, Ajunta Pall, went berserk and attacked you. The battle is over, and while you weren't able to select the correct sword initially it's possible one of the remaining swords *is* his blade... and would possibly suffice as a relic that would impress Master Uthar.
33050 := You were able to select the blade that once belonged to the Sith Lord Ajunta Pall, and his spirit was grateful that the weapon would at last leave his side. The weapon is certainly an impressive one... but it might also serve as a relic that would impress Master Uthar.
33051 := You encountered Shaardan on the way out of Ajunta Pall's tomb and surrendered the spirit's blade to him. It probably wasn't worth fighting over, anyhow.
33052 := On the way out of Ajunta Pall's tomb, you encountered one of your rivals: Shaardan. The Sith hopeful was actually dumb enough to take one of the spirit's false blades without closer examination. As for the real blade, that can probably be turned into Master Uthar, as well, unless you wish to keep it.
33053 := The dark sword of the Sith Lord Ajunta Pall has been turned over to Master Uthar, bringing you one step closer to obtaining enough prestige to move on to the final test.
33054 := The Trouble With Gizka
33055 := The fates seem to be conspiring against you. The disorganized port authorities on Tatooine appear to have shipped a delivery of gizka to the Ebon Hawk's hold... and there doesn't appear to be any way to give them back! The dockworker mentioned that some of the gizka "escaped", which certainly doesn't sound good...
33056 := You have managed to convince a Selkath on Manaan to take the gizka off your hands, though it was not easy. Hopefully the Selkath take *all* of the little beasts.
33057 := The infected gizka should soon rid the Ebon Hawk of its unwanted visitors, though you might want to keep a few doses of poison handy to deal with any pesky survivors.
33058 := The Way of the Sith
33059 := You have managed to enter the Sith academy as a hopeful vying with several others to become the one who will be finally admitted as a full Sith. In order to do so, you must prove your worth to Master Uthar Wynn by gaining prestige. More information can be gained by speaking to your instructor, Yuthura.
33060 := You have managed to gain some prestige, impressing Master Uthar, but it is not yet enough for him to declare you the victor in your contest with the others. Speak to Yuthura or continue to look around the academy and the Valley of the Dark Lords to find ways to curry favor with Master Uthar.
33061 := Master Uthar has been impressed enough to declare you worthy of taking the final test at the tomb of Naga Sadow. He has given you one night to rest up and prepare. When you are ready, return to him and he will bring you to the tomb.
33062 := Master Uthar and Yuthura Ban have brought you to the tomb of Naga Sadow... and there is no way out of the tomb until the test is complete. You will have to find the Star Map deep within the tomb: when you find it, you will also locate a ceremonial lightsaber. Return to Master Uthar with it.
33063 := Your final test within the tomb is over, and both Master Uthar and Yuthura are dead. You are unsure just how long it will be before anyone within the academy will realize that they are dead. Regardless, it may be a good idea to leave while you have the chance.
33064 := Your final test within the tomb is over, and Yuthura is dead. You spared Master Uthar, who has returned to the academy after telling you that your destiny leads elsewhere. If you wish to return to the academy and take up your studies as a full Sith in the future, Master Uthar says that you will be welcomed.
33065 := Your final test within the tomb is over, and Master Uthar is dead. Yuthura turned on you, but you defeated her and spared her life. She has returned to the academy to take over its leadership after telling you that your destiny leads elsewhere. If you wish to return to the academy in the future, Yuthura said that you would be welcomed.
33066 := Your final test within the tomb is over, and Master Uthar is dead. Yuthura turned on you, but you defeated her and spared her life. She decided to leave the Sith and at least speak to the Jedi that once had trained her. For the moment, the academy will not know that Master Uthar has been killed, so it may be a good time to leave Korriban while you can.
33067 := Threat from Xor
33068 := Juhani ran into a being named Xor, who bears her race a special grudge. He was a member of the fleet that attacked and destroyed her homeworld, Cathar, but was crippled during that fight. He has since tried to take out his pain on all Cathar he can find.

When Juhani had been sold into slavery for her parents' debt, Xor was the one who tried to purchase her. Revan's army stopped him that time, but he has not forgotten her.

He has sworn to get his revenge upon her and her people, and you don't know when or where he'll strike next. Juhani, though, lusts for his blood.
33069 := Xor attacked you unexpectedly, but you were able to defeat him. In his dying moments, he tried to lure Juhani to the dark side, to give in to her anger and hate and strike him down. She resisted the temptation, and he died an ignoble death.
33070 := Xor attacked you unexpectedly, but you were able to defeat him. In his dying moments, he tried to lure Juhani to the dark side, to give in to her anger and hate and strike him down. She could not resist and finished him once and for all, taking revenge for both herself, her people, and her homeworld.
33071 := Trapped on a Nameless World
33072 := You've crashed on a small, uncharted planet. In order to escape, you'll need to find some new stabilizers to repair the Ebon Hawk and you'll have to find some way to disable the disruptor field that caused you to crash in the first place.
33073 := The One, leader of a Rakata tribe, has made a deal with you. He has agreed to help you enter the Temple if you slaughter another Rakatan tribe known as the Elders. He wants you to go to their compound near the Temple and bring back an ancient tome in exchange for his help.
33074 := You've learned that an ancient ritual is the only way to get into the Temple. The details of the ritual are recorded in an ancient tome held by the Elder's Keeper of History. But the ritual will only work if it is performed by the Rakata, so you can't do this alone.
33075 := The One is dead, allowing you to search the salvage of the Black Rakata for the parts you need to repair the Ebon Hawk. Also, the Red Rakata have agreed to help you enter the Temple so you can shut down the disruptor field that caused your ship to crash on this nameless planet. However, they refuse to allow any of your companions to come with you.
33076 := The One has agreed to help you enter the Temple of the Ancients. However, he refuses to perform the ritual unless you go in alone. None of your companion's can come with you.
33077 := Despite the wishes of the Rakata, Jolee has come with you into the ancient Rakata temple. Together you should be able to find a way to disable the disruptor field and get off this planet.
33078 := Despite the wishes of the Rakata, Jolee and Juhani have come with you into the ancient Rakata temple. Together you should be able to find a way to disable the disruptor field and get off this planet.
33079 := Bastila has fallen to the dark side and sworn allegiance to Darth Malak. She fled to the Star Forge, where she will use her battle meditation to destroy the Republic fleet unless you find a way to get onto the Star Forge and stop her.
33080 := You have reclaimed your true identity as Lord of the Sith, and Bastila has sworn allegiance to you. The Jedi with you, however, would not bow before you and had to die. Now you must travel to the Star Forge for a final confrontation with your apprentice, Darth Malak.
33081 := Unfinished Business
33082 := You have encountered an alien by the name of Lurze who mentions that there is a container on board the Ebon Hawk filled with spice that Davik had agreed to bring him. You have agreed to return to Lurze with the spice, and he has provided you with the security code: "Red-47".
33083 := You encountered an alien by the name of Lurze who wanted some spice that was apparently put on the ship by Davik in order to be smuggled to him. You have refused to get involved, however, and Lurze left you alone... although he did comment that his employers might not be happy about this.
33084 := You found the spice on board the Ebon Hawk that Lurze told you about, but upon refusing to give it to him he attacked you rather than let you walk away with it. With Lurze gone, there's no way to find out anything about Davik's "arrangement" or whether this is the last you'll hear on the subject from Lurze's employers.
33085 := You turned over a shipment of spice that Davik had left on board the Ebon Hawk to an alien named Lurze. Lurze offered you further employment, but you refused to get involved any further and so he left you alone.
33086 := Upon turning over the spice to Lurze, he offered you further employment: take a strange box to Motta the Hutt at the swoop track on Tatooine. However, Lurze warned you *not* to open the box... though he was not clear on why or what might be inside.
33087 := The mysterious box has been turned over to Motta the Hutt, who paid you for your trouble without much comment. Whatever Motta intends to do with the box will likely remain a mystery, however.
33088 := You managed to escape from the prison world inside the box, but it was a narrow thing. Apparently Lurze was correct that opening the box was a bad thing. If you still intend to deliver it to Motta the Hutt, he can be found in at the swoop track on Tatooine.
33089 := Worthy of History
33090 := You have asked to hear the history of the Sand People, but the chieftain has said that you must first prove your worth as a warrior. Bring him a dragon pearl and he will consider it.
33091 := The Sand People have been angered. There is no way you will gain their trust now.
33092 := You have brought a dragon pearl to the Sand People chieftain. He will now allow you to speak with the storyteller, the keeper of their oral history.
33093 := All party members are now available.
33094 := There are 6 Jawas hiding in this room, can you see them all?
33095 := Welcome to the combat test range. I am capable of spawning creatures into the next room in order to test the different kinds of combat. What creature do you wish to spawn?
33096 := What creature should I add?

33268 := What are you talking about? The Council must be told of what we found there!
33269 := We found an incomplete Star Map, Master Vandar. And an ancient droid that mentioned something about a Star Forge.
33270 := It is a most grievous loss...
33271 := His strength was not enough...
33272 := You must prove you have a Jedi's understanding of the Code. Return when you feel you are ready for this challenge.
33273 := A Jedi must know this Code well. Feel free to ask any of the other Jedi if you have questions about it. Is there anything else?
33274 := Soon your apprenticeship will end and you will be granted the title of Padawan, the lowest rank of those within the Jedi Order. Yet first you must prove yourself worthy.
33275 := In the traditions and customs of our Order, as handed down from Master to pupil for a thousand generations, you must successfully complete three tests before you earn your place among the Jedi.
33276 := What must I do to prove myself?
33277 := Greetings, sentient. May I take a moment of your time for a question?
33278 := As you desire. I bid you good day, sentient.
33279 := As you desire, though I suspect there is little information I possess that would be of use to an off-worlder such as yourself.
33280 := I represent a human citizen of Dantooine by the name of Rundil ot Sulem. His ranch has had considerable difficulty with Mandalorian raiders for many years.
33281 := His young daughter was kidnapped by those raiders many years ago and has not been returned. Might you have news of her? Her name is Sasha.
33282 := I wish there were, sentient, for the possibility of a reward would certainly make my search much easier.
33283 := Since his daughter's kidnapping, however, the human citizen I work for has fallen on difficult times. He has no credits to offer.
33284 := I would still implore you to offer information, if you have it. Sasha is missed by her family and I desire very much to reunite them.
33285 := Is this so? It is not uncommon for young humans with minds on travel and adventure to stow away aboard vessels. Could this be Sasha?
33286 := The human I work for has no resources to offer you a reward, sentient. Neither do I, though I would gladly do so if I could.
33287 := I do not make it a habit to board the vessels of strange sentients. It is no slight against you... I find it difficult to judge the behavior of humans.
33288 := Should you find some evidence that this human girl is indeed Sasha, I would beg that you come to me with it. I can ask nothing more.
33289 := Sasha was kidnapped at a young age. It is possible that her education has been deficient... if this is indeed she.
33290 := And I take it she is no longer on board your ship, sentient? This is too bad, but at least it is hopeful news.
33291 := If the young human is actually the one I seek, I shall endeavor to locate her. Thank you for your information.
33292 := You are certain that her name was Sasha? This is good news.
33293 := The girl could be anywhere now, but I shall endeavor to track her down. Thank you for your information, sentient. I am most gratified.
33294 := This is most exciting news, sentient. Are you certain of this?
33295 := Alas, I have nothing in the way of a reward to offer you, sentient. Sasha's human father has fallen on difficult times since her kidnapping.
33296 := I would give you credits of my own, but I also have nothing. I cannot stop you from holding the human girl... I can only plead with you to release her.
33297 := Are you certain that this human girl is Sasha, sentient? Please do tell me.
33298 := Then... there is nothing I can do. Should you alter your decision, sentient, I would beg you to return to me.
33299 := You are very cruel, human. I shall have to watch your vessel and hopefully see if the human girl leaves.
33300 := If you hurt her, human... if you hurt her, I hope you suffer for it.
33301 := You have convinced me, sentient, that your stowaway is indeed the one I seek. Would you allow me to see her?
33302 := But I have nothing to offer you, sentient. Might you not reconsider?
33303 := Let us go there now. I am most anxious to see her.
33304 := Then... take what I have, though it leaves me with nothing. I will be satisfied if I am able to reunite Sasha with her family.
33305 := You say her language is odd? It... it is possible that Sasha was not taught proper language in the years of her captivity.
33306 := Still, you leave me in a difficult position, human. I find it difficult to ascertain the motive of humans... you could be deceitful and I would not know it.
33307 := I do not wish to compromise my safety, or offend you, but I do wish to be certain of your stowaway's identity before I risk visiting your vessel.
33308 := Please... can you not make an effort to be more certain that this is the Sasha that I seek? I beg you to make the attempt.
33309 := I have been trying to locate the human girl for several years now, sentient. This is a dangerous region of space, however, so I must be cautious.
33310 := It would sadden me to discover that my caution had allowed Sasha to escape my discovery... but too often have sentients attempted to mislead me for nefarious purposes.
33311 := I mean no offense. I simply am unable to judge human motivations. I hope you can forgive me and do as I request.
33312 := Thank you, sentient. I shall pray for your swift success.
33313 := I do not make it a habit to board the vessels of strange humans, but... but I might make an exception this once. Are you certain the human is Sasha?
33314 := It is not customary for the Mandalorians to terminate their captives. It is my hope Sasha has escaped or been sold into slavery. If so, I may yet locate her.
33315 := Ah, that is too bad. I shall have to continue my search.
33316 := As you wish. Thank you for your assistance.
33317 := I would appreciate that, sentient.
33318 := There is no large urban center on Dantooine, if that is what interests you. I find the variety and number of natural habitats to be most intriguing, however.
33319 := If you get the chance, I would urge you to explore the planet's ranges in more detail. They are quite beautiful.
33320 := Dantooine has little in the way of local authorities, sentient. I asked the Jedi of the enclave to intervene, but they have far more pressing concerns to attend to.
33321 := As is often the way on this planet, if a citizen wishes to accomplish something, they must seek to do it themselves.
33322 := I understand they are, though I know little of the history behind this conflict. Someone native to this planet could tell you more.
33323 := Greetings once again, sentient. Have you any news of the human girl aboard your vessel?
33324 := Greetings once again, sentient. Are you yet certain of the identity of the human girl you believe to be Sasha?
33325 := Though you have aged, young sentient, I do believe you are indeed the one I seek. I am here to return you to your father.
33326 := Yooba na abds?
33327 := I see that <FirstName> was correct about your linguistic difficulties. I am positive that your parents can assist you with that.
33328 := Me abd liaz! Me na awnts palkie!
33329 := Calm yourself, child. I will take you home.
33330 := <FirstName>?
33331 := Laesfa? Me palkie laesfa?
33332 := Yb, bristag. Yb-abu, <FirstName>!
33333 := Thank you for your assistance, sentient. I am sure the girl's parents will be most appreciative of your efforts.
33334 := I don't have time for questions.
33335 := Only if I get to ask you something in return.
33336 := Go ahead.
33337 := Is there a reward for this news?
33338 := I have a young human girl stowing away on my ship, but I don't know her name.
33339 := How much would you pay to find that out?
33340 := I don't know and I don't care.
33341 := Why don't you come and see her for yourself?
33342 := I don't know. Her language is odd.
33343 := There used to be a young human girl stowaway on my ship, but I didn't get her name.
33344 := There was a stowaway on my ship named Sasha, but I drove her off.
33345 := There is a stowaway on my ship by the name of Sasha.
33346 := I am if the reward is sufficient.
33347 := Sorry. No reward, no deal.
33348 := I'll drive her off the ship later. Maybe you can find her then and see for yourself.
33349 := Yes, I am. She only speaks a smattering of Mandalorian, but I was able to figure it out.
33350 := Only if I get something in return for my trouble.
33351 := Alright, fine. Just get her off my ship.
33352 := Either cough up a reward or forget it.
33353 := Certainly. I'll bring you to my ship.
33354 := I think so. Her language is very odd... I can't figure it out.
33355 := If you don't care to try, why should I?
33356 := If I have the time, I'll see what I can do.
33357 := I'll try my best.
33358 := I think so. She speaks a strange version of Mandalorian... I can't figure it out.
33359 := You can come on board and see her, if you like.
33360 := Do you actually believe she's still alive?
33361 := Sorry, I have no idea who you're talking about.
33362 := I've got to go.
33363 := I'll keep my eye out for your girl.
33364 := Is there anything of interest on Dantooine that you can tell me about?
33365 := Isn't this something the local authorities should handle?
33366 := Are problems with Mandalorians common on Dantooine?
33367 := No, I haven't had much chance to talk to her.
33368 := Not really.
33369 := Her name is Sasha, but she's not on my ship any longer.
33370 := Her name is Sasha, I know that much.
33371 := Just go. I've had enough of this.

33480 := This is private property! By what authority are you trespassing on this estate?

33487 := Nurik has nothing more to say to you. He left strict instructions he was not to be disturbed under any circumstances.
33488 := You may give the diary to me. Nurik wanted you to have these credits - they are a reward for recovering his son's diary. But he himself is too upset over the fate of Carsus to receive visitors.
33489 := Casus is dead? Then it is as we feared. I will be sure Nurik is given this news, though it will break his heart. But even under these circumstances I cannot let you in.

33496 := I come on behalf of the Jedi Council.
33497 := In the name of the Council, I demand you let me in!
33498 := I am not in league with the Matales, but I must speak to Nurik.
33499 := I have his son's diary. Nurik asked me to bring it to him.

33595 := At any rate, the gizka are yours. One of the loaders said the crate split open once he put it in your hold... some of the critters might have gotten lose.
33596 := That happens, I'm afraid. We don't accept liability... and we certainly couldn't take the cargo back. Enjoy.
33597 := If you want the cargo removed, you'll have to fill out another requisition. I have one right... wait. I thought I had one. Oh, well.
33598 := It says right here on the manifest that you ordered a crate of gizka. To be delivered to docking bay 32... that's right here.
33599 := Well, let me see. Docking bay 32, check... crate 42-B7, check... manifest lists "life form: gizka". Everything seems to be in order.
33600 := This is docking bay 32, isn't it? Yes, it is, and that's what I have here on the requisition form. Everything seems to be in order. The gizka are your problem now.
33601 := Excellent. Thank you.
33602 := Fair enough. Thanks.
33603 := Whatever you put on my ship, I want it off. Now.
33604 := What do you mean "my problem"? I didn't order any gizka.

33617 := I represent a human citizen of Dantooine by the name of Rundil ot Sulem. His ranch has had considerable difficulty with Mandalorian raiders for many years.
33618 := His young daughter was kidnapped by those raiders many years ago and has not been returned. Might you have news of her? Her name is Sasha.
33619 := I wish there were, sentient, for the possibility of a reward would certainly make my search much easier.
33620 := Since his daughter's kidnapping, however, the human citizen I work for has fallen on difficult times. He has no credits to offer.
33621 := I would still implore you to offer information, if you have it. Sasha is missed by her family and I desire very much to reunite them.
33622 := Is this so? It is not uncommon for young humans with minds on travel and adventure to stowaway aboard vessels. Could this be Sasha?
33623 := The human I work for has no resources to offer you a reward, sentient. Neither do I, though I would gladly do so if I could.
33624 := I do not make it a habit to board the vessels of strange sentients. It is no slight against you... I find it difficult to judge the behavior of humans.
33625 := Should you find some evidence that this human girl is indeed Sasha, I would beg that you come to me with it. I can ask nothing more.
33626 := Sasha was kidnapped at a young age. It is possible that her education has been deficient... if this is indeed she.
33627 := And I take it she is no longer on board your ship, sentient? This is too bad, but at least it is hopeful news.
33628 := If the young human is actually the one I seek, I shall endeavour to locate her. Thank you for your information.
33629 := You are certain that her name was Sasha? This is good news.
33630 := The girl could be anywhere now, but I shall endeavour to track her down. Thank you for your information, sentient. I am most gratified.
33631 := This is most exciting news, sentient. Are you certain of this?
33632 := Alas, I have nothing in the way of a reward to offer you, sentient. Sasha's human father has fallen on difficult times since her kidnapping.
33633 := I would give you credits of my own, but I also have nothing. I cannot stop you from holding the human girl... I can only plead with you to release her.
33634 := Are you certain that this human girl is Sasha, sentient? Please do tell me.
33635 := Then... there is nothing I can do. Should you alter your decision, sentient, I would beg you to return to me.
33636 := You are very cruel, human. I shall have to watch your vessel and hopefully see if the human girl leaves.
33637 := If you hurt her, human... if you hurt her, I hope you suffer for it.
33638 := You have convinced me, sentient, that your stowaway is indeed the one I seek. Would you allow me to see her?
33639 := But I have nothing to offer you, sentient. Might you not reconsider?
33640 := Let us go there now. I am most anxious to see her.
33641 := Then... take what I have, though it leaves me with nothing. I will be satisfied if I am able to reunite Sasha with her family.
33642 := You say her language is odd? It... it is possible that Sasha was not taught proper language in the years of her captivity.
33643 := Still, you leave me in a difficult position, human. I find it difficult to ascertain the motive of humans... you could be deceitful and I would not know it.
33644 := I do not wish to compromise my safety, nor offend you... but I do wish to be certain of your stowaway's identity before I risk visiting your vessel.
33645 := Please... can you not make an effort to be more certain that this is the Sasha that I seek? I beg you to make the attempt.
33646 := I have been trying to locate the human girl for several years now, sentient. This is a dangerous region of space, however, so I must be cautious.
33647 := It would sadden me to discover that my caution had allowed Sasha to escape my discovery... but too often have sentients attempted to mislead me for nefarious purposes.
33648 := I mean no offense. I simply am unable to judge human motivations. I hope you can forgive me and do as I request.
33649 := Thank you, sentient. I shall pray for your swift success.
33650 := I do not make it a habit to board the vessels of strange humans, but... but I might make an exception this once. Are you certain the human is Sasha?
33651 := It is not customary for the Mandalorians to terminate their captives. It is my hope Sasha has escaped or been sold into slavery. If so, I may yet locate her.
33652 := Ah, that is too bad. I shall have to continue my search.
33653 := As you wish. Thank you for your assistance.
33654 := I would appreciate that, sentient.
33655 := There is no large urban center on Dantooine, if that is what interests you. I find the variety and number of natural habitats to be most intriguing, however.
33656 := If you get the chance, I would urge you to explore the planet's ranges in more detail. They are quite beautiful.
33657 := Dantooine has little in the way of local authorities, sentient. I asked the Jedi of the enclave to intervene, but they have far more pressing concerns to attend to.
33658 := As is often the way on this planet, if a citizen wishes to accomplish something, they must seek to do it themselves.
33659 := I understand they are, though I know little of the history behind this conflict. Someone native to this planet could tell you more.
33660 := Greetings once again, sentient. Have you any news of the human girl aboard your vessel?
33661 := Greetings once again, sentient. Are you yet certain of the identity of the human girl you believe to be Sasha?
33662 := Though you have aged, young sentient, I do believe you are indeed the one I seek. I am here to return you to your father.
33663 := You-be na bads?
33664 := I see that <FirstName> was correct about your linguistic difficulties. I am positive that your parents can assist you with that.
33665 := Me bad wail! Me na wants walkie!
33666 := Calm yourself, child. I will take you home.
33667 := <FirstName>?
33668 := All safe? Me walkies all safe?
33669 := Bye-bye, star big! Bye-bye, <FirstName>!
33670 := Thank you for your assistance, sentient. I am sure the girl's parents will be most appreciative of your efforts.
33671 := I don't have time for questions.
33672 := Only if I get to ask you something in return.
33673 := Go ahead.
33674 := Is there a reward for this news?
33675 := I have a young human girl stowing away on my ship, but I don't know her name.
33676 := How much would you pay to find that out?
33677 := I don't know and I don't care.
33678 := Why don't you come and see her for yourself?
33679 := I don't know. Her language is odd.
33680 := There used to be a young human girl stowaway on my ship, but I didn't get her name.
33681 := There was a stowaway on my ship named Sasha, but I drove her off.
33682 := There is a stowaway on my ship by the name of Sasha.
33683 := I am if the reward is sufficient.
33684 := Sorry. No reward, no deal.
33685 := I'll drive her off the ship later. Maybe you can find her then and see for yourself.
33686 := Yes, I am. She only speaks a smattering of Mandalorian, but I was able to figure it out.
33687 := Only if I get something in return for my trouble.
33688 := Alright, fine. Just get her off my ship.
33689 := Either cough up a reward or forget it.
33690 := Certainly. I'll bring you to my ship.
33691 := I think so. Her language is very odd... I can't figure it out.
33692 := If you don't care to try, why should I?
33693 := If I have the time, I'll see what I can do.
33694 := I'll try my best.
33695 := I think so. She speaks a strange version of Mandalorian... I can't figure it out.
33696 := You can come on board and see her, if you like.
33697 := Do you actually believe she's still alive?
33698 := Sorry, I have no idea who you're talking about.
33699 := I've got to go.
33700 := I'll keep my eye out for your girl.
33701 := Is there anything of interest on Dantooine that you can tell me about?
33702 := Isn't this something the local authorities should handle?
33703 := Are problems with Mandalorians common on Dantooine?
33704 := No, I haven't had much chance to talk to her.
33705 := Not really.
33706 := Her name is Sasha, but she's not on my ship any longer.
33707 := Her name is Sasha, I know that much.
33708 := Just go. I've had enough of this.
33709 := Lur Arka na bads. He takes-now you-be all safe, Sasha.
33710 := You there, human... you are the one flying the Ebon Hawk now? I saw you disembarking earlier.
33711 := Whoa, now! You're just going to have to make a little time, human. We've been waiting for this shipment for over a month.
33712 := I suppose we should be grateful that the shipment survived Taris at all, though, right? Anyway... hand it over and let's finish this.
33713 := Wait a minute... don't you work for Davik? Just how is it you happen to be flying the Ebon Hawk, anyway?
33714 := I'm not here to give you any trouble, human. The people I represent and Davik had an arrangement... I just want to know what the status of it is.
33715 := Fair enough. To be honest, I don't really care what happened to Davik or how you got the ship. I'm interested in something else.
33716 := Well, when a planet explodes, you've got to expect a few changes. Davik's dead, hey? Maybe you can still help me with something.
33717 := We had arranged for several kilograms of spice to be shipped to us here aboard the Ebon Hawk. Perhaps Davik left it on board?
33718 := I suspect if it is, it would be in the container we gave him. Locked and requiring a code. Might you have seen such a thing, human?
33719 := Are you sure? The people I represent could make it well worth your while.
33720 := That is unfortunate. The people I represent will be... displeased. They've already lost their interests on Taris, after all.
33721 := But it is your choice, human. Pray that no-one takes your refusal personally.
33722 := Excellent. Set the code on the container to "Red-47". When you get the spice, bring it to me here... I'll wait for you.
33723 := One thousand credits... and perhaps more, if you're interested. What do you say to that?
33724 := My employers would be disappointed, no doubt. Have you another use for the spice, human? Consider carefully.
33725 := So you do. That does, indeed, look like the amount that Davik promised. Very well... 1000 credits is yours in exchange for the spice.
33726 := The authorities? Do you mean the Sith? This is Korriban, human... the Sith here have no interest in smuggling.
33727 := But I have no desire, either, for you to take the package back into Republic space. Extortion or no, I will give you 1500 credits... but no more.
33728 := Are you certain? It is odd to meet a human who is uninterested in free credits. But have it your way.
33729 := Done and done, human. Here you are.
33730 := Allow me to take the spice off your hands. My employers will be most pleased. Tell me... might you be interested in earning more credits?
33731 := Not interested in the smuggling business, are we? You do know the history of the Ebon Hawk, I assume? Well, no matter.
33732 := It is your decision. I wish you well, human, and thank you for the service you have provided.
33733 := It is a simple courier mission. Motta the Hutt on Tatooine awaits delivery of a box that I hold. The spice was his, and the box is his repayment.
33734 := There is no danger involved, human, so long as you do not attempt to open the box yourself. Motta will reward you well, I am sure.
33735 := He can be found in Anchorhead, though I am uncertain exactly where. He should not be difficult to spot, fat as he is.
33736 := *Never* open the box. Opening the box would be horribly bad.
33737 := It is not a bomb. Just do not open it... that is all I can say. It represents no danger to you so long as it remains closed.
33738 := I suppose I would eventually have to, should you refuse. You are already here, however, and you have a ship... it is most convenient to have you deliver the box.
33739 := Very good. Here you are, human... take this to Motta on Tatooine. And remember: do *not* open it, whatever you do.
33740 := Now I must go. My employers thank you for your assistance.
33741 := [Failure] You may not have been part of the original arrangement, human, but our terms for you are no different. 1000 credits, no more.
33742 := Are you sure you want to do that? This is not something you can sell at your nearest kiosk, human. Do you have the contacts to make such a sale?
33743 := My employers will be most disappointed if this spice turns up elsewhere. The price we offer is a fair one.
33744 := Then you leave me no choice. I will take that spice now, thank you.
33745 := [Success] I... suppose we should... count ourselves fortunate that you're here to deliver on Davik's promise at all. 1500 credits, human, but no more.
33746 := [Success] I suppose we should count ourselves fortunate that you're here to deliver on Davik's promise at all. 1500 credits, human, but no more.
33747 := Here you are. You drive a hard bargain, human.
33748 := Is that so? Well, you can tell Davik that my people are spitting plasma over this. We've been waiting for this shipment for a month, now.
33749 := Name's Lurze, not that it's important. I don't know you and you don't know me. What's important is that we've been waiting for this shipment for a month, now.
33750 := There you are. Do you have the spice, human?
33751 := No? Could you be persuaded to continue looking for it? The spice it carries is most eagerly awaited by my employers.
33752 := I don't have time to talk.
33753 := I'm no smuggler, if that's what you're implying.
33754 := Look, I don't want any trouble, okay?
33755 := I'm sure we could work out something, if you're interested.
33756 := There is no arrangement. The Ebon Hawk belongs to me, now.
33757 := What business is it of yours? The Ebon Hawk is mine, now.
33758 := Davik's dead, I presume. I stole the Ebon Hawk from him.
33759 := There's nothing like that on the ship.
33760 := I don't want to get involved in this.
33761 := Fine. I'll take a look for your container.
33762 := I said I didn't want to get involved.
33763 := How well worth my while?
33764 := I could take a look for it.
33765 := I may have. How much is it worth to you?
33766 := And if I refuse?
33767 := I already opened that container. I have the spice right here.
33768 := Make it 2000 credits or I hand this package over to the authorities.
33769 := Just take the spice. I don't want it or your credits.
33770 := Fair enough. 1000 credits it is.
33771 := Get out of my sight, scum.
33772 := No, not really.
33773 := Maybe. Tell me more.
33774 := Forget it. Not interested.
33775 := Where can I find this Motta?
33776 := What happens if I open the box?
33777 := But what would happen? Is it a bomb?
33778 := Why don't you just bring it to him yourself?
33779 := Alright. I'll do it.
33780 := [Persuade] I don't work for Davik, remember? I want more.
33781 := Then I guess I'll be keeping the spice.
33782 := I'll take my chances.
33783 := [Force Persuade] I think you want to offer me a higher price.
33784 := You obviously have me mistaken for someone else.
33785 := Hand what over? What are you talking about?
33786 := Yes, the Ebon Hawk is my ship.
33787 := Who wants to know?
33788 := I couldn't find your container.
33789 := No, I don't think so.
33790 := I'll try looking again.
33791 := Oh, wait, I have it right here...
33792 := I've decided I don't want to get involved in this.
33793 := Not yet, but I'll look for it.
33794 := Yes, I do.
33795 := Greetings again, off-worlder. Have you happened upon any exotic species since we last spoke?
33796 := Poor, to tell the truth. I am beginning to think we shall have no species at all in our xoological exhibit. *sigh*
33797 := Greetings! Forgive me if this seems an odd question, off-worlder, but might you have any exotic species for sale? Nothing dangerous, mind you.
33798 := Well, if you do come across something potentially interesting, please remember me. My name is Nubassa. I hope to see you again!
33799 := Gizka? You speak of the small, bipedal amphibians with the overly high reproductive rate, correct? Oh, no, I am afraid I cannot take those.
33800 := A compatriot of mine made the mistake of purchasing a pair of such creatures several months ago. Within weeks our storage facilities were nearly overrun.
33801 := If you are in possession of such creatures, I hope you keep them separated. If not, then you have my condolences.
33802 := My pleasure. Should you encounter some other exotic species, do please let me know.
33803 := [Success] Hmm. But maybe we could use these gizka, after all. It is better then having nothing at all to show, I suppose.
33804 := Since they are so difficult to maintain, however, I would ask that you provide 100 credits. Then I will take them off your hands.
33805 := [Failure] That is unfair of you to ask, off-worlder. You are attempting to sell me something I have already stated I do not need.
33806 := [Success] I... suppose it is natural for off-worlders to desire commerce, even when it is unfair. Very well, I shall do as you ask, in the interest of peace.
33807 := Here are your credits. I shall send someone by to remove the gizka from your vessel. Good day, off-worlder.
33808 := [Failure] The cost of maintaining such creatures is very high. I would be removing pests for you at my own expense?
33809 := [Success] *sigh* I suppose it is better than nothing. We must have some creatures in our exhibit, after all.
33810 := I shall send some of my people by to remove the gizka on your vessel. Thank you for your co-operation.
33811 := [Failure] I... I do not... no, I am afraid that you are mistaken. I do require coin to compensate for my aid. These gizka are not easy to manage.
33812 := [Success] What am I thinking? It is impertinent of me to ask you for credits when you are attempting to make a sale. My apologies.
33813 := You do not even have 100 credits? Then you are in dire straits, indeed. You certainly do not need these pests on your vessel.
33814 := In the interest of maintaining peace, I shall remove them and use what I can. Thank you for your assistance, off-worlder... I hope your situation improves soon.
33815 := Very well. It is a pleasure doing business with you... I will have my people show up to remove your gizka as soon as possible.
33816 := Thank you very much. For an off-worlder, interacting with you has been most pleasant.
33817 := [Failure] I have never heard of such a creature. I suspect you are merely desperate to offload your difficult circumstance onto another. Shame on you, off-worlder!
33818 := [Success] They do not? Well, that is marvelous news! We would have the benefit of obtaining the gizka without the inconvenience of their numbers!
33819 := If you wish, I will send some others over to your vessels right away to remove the gizka.
33820 := [Failure] I am willing to take these gizka off your hands because of their unusual nature... I certainly will not purchase them!
33821 := As you wish. Our negotiation is hereby suspended.
33822 := [Success] Ah. I hope 100 credits will be sufficient, then? I realize that such a rare strain of gizka might be worth more, but it is all I can afford.
33823 := Thank you for your assistance, off-worlder. Dealing with you has proven far more pleasureable than I anticipated.
33824 := [Failure] I do not think so, no. They have proven to be far too much trouble in the past.
33825 := [Success] *sigh* I suppose it would. I am not looking forward to the trouble this will cause, but if it will help you out... I will do what I can.
33826 := I shall send some people by your vessel shortly to remove the gizka. Good day to you, off-worlder.
33827 := [Success] I... suppose having a few of the creatures would not be of harm. We do have experience handling them now, I suppose.
33828 := I am sure you would. They are practically a nuisance. I have no need of them, however, as I stated.
33829 := Ah, good question. The Selkath have little exposure to life from other planets, you see, but our government hopes to change that.
33830 := We are setting up a zoological compound for visitation by the public, and are hoping to stock it with non-offensive foreign creatures of all types.
33831 := The only problem right now is actually procuring the exotic species we need. Selkath import restrictions are quite prohibitive, to say the least.
33832 := I would not use such a harsh word, off-worlder. Let us say that I am interested in engaging in private trade. That is allowed, according to our laws.
33833 := Finding off-worlders that deal in such trade is most difficult, however. I have become quite desperate. Might you have what I seek?
33834 := Anything non-sentient and non-carnivorous will do, though creatures that are easy to manage are preferred. Is that understandable?
33835 := How has the hunt been?
33836 := I don't have time for questions.
33837 := I have some gizka, if you're interested.
33838 := Thanks anyway, then.
33839 := [Force Persuade] But you want to take these gizka off my hands.
33840 := [Persuade] You want me to *pay* you? How about you give me 100 credits?
33841 := [Persuade] I was hoping to sell them. How about we just call it even?
33842 := Fine. 100 credits it is.
33843 := [Force Persuade] You don't need any credits to take them.
33844 := But... I actually don't have 100 credits.
33845 := Deal. I want those things off my ship as soon as possible.
33846 := [Persuade/Lie] But these are special gizka. They don't reproduce like the others do.
33847 := Sounds good to me.
33848 := [Persuade] The gizka are for *sale*... they aren't free.
33849 := Forget it. No deal.
33850 := Fine, take them, then.
33851 := [Persuade] Is there no way I can convince you to take them off my hands?
33852 := [Persuade] How about if I paid you 100 credits as well? Would that help?
33853 := Actually, I would *really* like to get rid of these creatures.
33854 := No, I don't have anything for you.
33855 := Why would you want to buy animals?
33856 := So you want to smuggle them in?
33857 := Exotic species? What sorts of exotic species?
33858 := What what what? Something else come into my prison? Already?
33859 := So very long a time and nothing. Then in a span of mere months three in a row! What sheer luck!
33860 := Well let's have a look at you. Hmm. Biped. More or less symmetrical. Far less hair than the last one. Opposable digits. Mostly water, hey? I suppose you'll have to do.
33861 := Oh? Your race is a violent one, then? I see, I see. My own race is not so different. Are you familiar with us? The others weren't.
33862 := I'm a prisoner here. As are you, yes indeed... though I suspect by accident rather than by sentence, yes? I was put here on purpose.
33863 := My own people put our criminals in little cages like this. Well... our minds, anyway. For really terrible criminals like me our mind gets locked away forever.
33864 := How long have I been here now? Hmmm... one... four... no, no, longer than that. I've never been very good with numbers.
33865 := And what would you do? Harm me? You think you're wearing those clothes, here, and carrying those weapons? Interesting, really.
33866 := No no no... there's not a thing we can do to each other. So you needn't worry, I can't harm you. Isn't that reassuring?
33867 := Oh yes yes indeed. Two others of entirely different species visited me before you. I couldn't speak with them like I can with you, however.
33868 := They eventually grew angry and ran off into the whiteness. If you go far enough out, you may find them... though I wouldn't recommend it.
33869 := They're likely quite mad. All this whiteness can do that to you, you know. It'll drive you mad mad mad. If you let it.
33870 := I led a war. Well, a rebellion really, though the details would hardly interest you. Many of my kind died, and I'm responsible... or so they said.
33871 := Can you think of a better prison than one without walls? What does your species use? Cages, I suppose.
33872 := Well, now *that* is a most interesting question. Yes yes yes indeed.
33873 := I've been here long enough to ponder that. How many years, now? A thousand? Ten thousand? Bah... I could never remember the numbers, even when I kept track.
33874 := The point is that I know a way out of this clever little prison. Interesting, that, wouldn't you say?
33875 := Isn't there always? There's only one place that one of us can escape to... and that's your body. Mine, I'm sure, is not available.
33876 := Now before you go off getting all excited and defensive, let me tell you that I can't go jumping into your body without your willing agreement.
33877 := Conversely, you can't go jumping back into your body without my knowledge. This leaves us at something of an impasse, wouldn't you agree?
33878 := It is like this, dear sentient... if you like, we could spend the next thousand years debating. You want out, I want out, it could go on and on.
33879 := Unless your species is remarkably long-lived, I doubt your body has a thousand years. And, frankly, I doubt either of us is going to convince the other of anything, yes?
33880 := So why waste the time? A simple competition between the two of us and we settle the matter. You win, you go free. I win, I go free. Yes?
33881 := Why would I do that? And however would you coerce me to do so? No no no... we play or you stay. Simple as that.
33882 := Does it? In truth, I've had a long time to think it over. You can take your time thinking about it, yourself, but why?
33883 := I have little clue as to which activities you are superior at. You are at the same disadvantage with me, I suspect.
33884 := So the best game is one of the mind. An exchange of riddles, perhaps. The first of us to fail at an answer loses. What do you think?
33885 := Hmm. Perhaps we should restrict ourselves from riddles specific to our culture or race. A kiratta-sarn, while wonderful to look at, would be meaningless to you, I'm sure.
33886 := Beyond that, I shouldn't think there be any rules necessary. A riddle is a riddle. So are we agreed?
33887 := For that matter, what's to stop *you* from cheating? The only thing I can think of is that it's quite hard to cheat at riddles. Fair is fair.
33888 := Mmmm no doubt. You may have missed my earlier statement, so let me remind you that your physical body is not really here.
33889 := Your muscles do not exert anything and you can apply no force here. Hence a "physical" challenge is somewhat impossible, no?
33890 := So let's restrict ourselves to the mental challenges, my dear sentient.
33891 := Now now no need to be fussy. If I seem to be moving fast it's simply because I've had an overabundance of time to consider this scenario.
33892 := That being the case, and seeing as this is technically my home, I'll go first. Now... let's see...
33893 := "Until I am measured, I am not known,
yet how you miss me when I have flown."
33894 := Mmm? Are you quite serious with that answer? And here I thought I was only warming up. The answer is time!
33895 := My, my, my... the contest is over already! Fair is fair, sentient... I go free.
33896 := With luck you will someday find a body of your own, yes? So don't despair... but do hold still.
33897 := Yes yes yes... I suppose that was an easy one. Perhaps I should have used all this time to think of harder riddles, hey?
33898 := Fair is fair, sentient. Your turn.
33899 := Hmmm... what a very odd and valuable thing this must be. Think think think! Is it... no no no, not that. Hmmm...
33900 := Is the answer... time? Could it be?
33901 := Blast! Spends nothing, saves nothing, carries nothing to his grave! Yes yes yes I should have known! Ahhhhh, you have won.
33902 := Never lie, hey? Hmmm. There is something familiar here... I cannot place my finger upon it. Look you in the eye... your reflection! It is your reflection!
33903 := Never lie, hey? Hmmm. There is something familiar here... I cannot place my finger upon it. Look you in the eye... look you in the eye...
33904 := No no! Not numbers! Never have I been good with numbers! Hmmm... think think think! Five times five... add the one... no no no...
33905 := Err... carry the two... ninety-four? No, ninety-six! Is it ninety-six?
33906 := Ahh! Fooled, I have been! Fooled myself! Very very clever of you! You have won!
33907 := Hmmm... what an odd riddle. Yes yes yes, let me see. Hear again, and then call again... an echo? It is an echo! Ha ha!
33908 := Hmmm... what an odd riddle. Yes yes yes, let me see. Hear again, and then call again... what could it be?
33909 := What manner of plant could that be? But it does not grow... so is it no plant at all? It... it is a mountain! Yes, that is it!
33910 := What manner of plant could that be? But it does not grow... so is it no plant at all? Think think think!
33911 := Oh my... there are not many things that keep working once they're broken. Hmmm... oh! Oh, yes. Your heart! Heart is the answer!
33912 := Very clever, sentient... but it is my turn once again!
33913 := "To keep me, I must be given. If I am not kept, I am broken."
33914 := True, true, you have the right of it. If your word is not kept, it is broken.
33915 := Ha! No no no you are wrong! It is your word! You must give your word... and if your word is not kept, it is broken!
33916 := "I am always hungry, I must always be fed.
The finger I lick will soon turn red."
33917 := Yes, it's true. I wasn't sure if you blistered as we did... but it appears you do. So be it.
33918 := No no no! You are wrong! A flame is the answer, to blister you red!
33919 := "Who makes it has no need of it.
Who buys it has no use for it.
Who uses it has no knowledge of it."
33920 := Yes, that's it. A grave it is, though I'll likely never see one.
33921 := No no no, you are wrong! A grave is the answer! To bury the dead!
33922 := "I never was, yet always will be. I am never seen, yet always come.
I can carry nothing, yet hold much for some."
33923 := Aha! Caught you, I have! Tomorrow is the answer! Tomorrow!
33924 := Yes yes yes, you have the right of it. Tomorrow it is.
33925 := Oh my... there are not many things that keep working once they're broken. Hmmm... hmmmm. Snared? No no no, that's not it!
33926 := I... I concede. I do not know the answer to your riddle. You are victorious.
33927 := *sigh* It appears my destiny is to be imprisoned even longer. Are you ready to return to your body, sentient?
33928 := There's nothing complicated to it. It's better for me to just show you than teach you. Just close your eyes a moment, sentient...
33929 := You know... you're right. And maybe they won't be as intelligent as you, either. That makes me feel much better, thank you.
33930 := Oh, I certainly doubt that. No offense, but your species hardly strikes me as that advanced. Besides... I'm not ready to explode into bitty atoms just yet.
33931 := I doubt you could help. My people made quite certain that escaping these prisons was a difficult prospect, you know.
33932 := It took me as long as I've been here to figure out the only exit... and even then, I'm sure it's only happened because my prison is no longer secure.
33933 := Hmmm. I do have to wonder how that happened. Are my people still about? If they were, I can't see that they'd let my prison loose so easily.
33934 := But even if they are gone, I doubt you'd be able to find any way to release me. No, I suppose I shall just have to wait for someone who is not as proficient at riddles as you are to come along.
33935 := Eh? My name? It's... it's... well how do you like that? I've completely forgotten.
33936 := I think I knew it a thousand years ago. I guess I've been here so long I've forgotten. My, that is depressing.
33937 := You have no reason not to trust me, now. If I were to betray you, then you would never trust me again... and we would be stuck here arguing forever.
33938 := I suppose that's true. But if you won and I did not release you, there would never be another chance for me to escape anyway, would there? You would never agree to it.
33939 := Hence I may as well let you go, if you win. It is my one and only opportunity for freedom.
33940 := Did I not already say that I could only take your body if you were willing? Yes yes I believe I did. We are still communicating, correct?
33941 := What I suggest is for us to settle this now, like civilized beings.
33942 := Why would I not tell you? My escape requires your involvement... and your body, I might add.
33943 := How clever of you to realize that? Indeed you are correct. Your body, however, is not.
33944 := Eh? For a body, of course. I don't want to remain in this prison forever, no no no.
33945 := Back off, creature! I don't care to be inspected!
33946 := Mind telling me who and what you are?
33947 := Just keep your distance, I'm warning you.
33948 := You said "three in a row" earlier. Have there been others besides me?
33949 := What did you do to get imprisoned here?
33950 := This is a prison?
33951 := Is there no way out of here?
33952 := Let me guess: there's a catch.
33953 := How do I know you aren't lying to me?
33954 := Forget it! Tell me how to get out! NOW!!
33955 := This sounds deceptively simple.
33956 := What kind of competition do you mean?
33957 := What are the rules?
33958 := And what's to stop you from cheating?
33959 := I'd rather a more physical challenge.
33960 := I don't seem to have much of a choice.
33961 := Energy.
33962 := Hope.
33963 := Time.
33964 := "What does a poor man have that a rich man requires,
what a miser spends and a thrifty man saves,
and all men carry to their graves?"
33965 := The answer is "nothing".
33966 := "You can see nothing else when you look in my face,
I will look you in the eye and I will never lie."
33967 := "Flying to Dantooine I meet five ships.
Each ship has five crewmen, each crewman five pets.
How many in all are flying to Dantooine?"
33968 := It's one. I'm the only one flying to Dantooine.
33969 := "You heard me before, yet you hear me again,
Then I die, until you call me again."
33970 := "What has roots as nobody sees, is taller than the trees,
up up it goes and yet it never grows."
33971 := "If you break me, I do not stop working.
If you touch me, I may be snared.
If you lose me, nothing will matter."
33972 := Your word.
33973 := The sound barrier.
33974 := A mirror.
33975 := Love.
33976 := A mouth.
33977 := A starship engine.
33978 := A flame.
33979 := A gizka.
33980 := A grave.
33981 := Time.
33982 := Energy.
33983 := Air.
33984 := Vacuum.
33985 := Rain.
33986 := Gravity.
33987 := Tomorrow.
33988 := I'm ready to go.
33989 := Right. Get me out of here, and don't do anything funny.
33990 := Don't worry. I'm sure someone else will be along before you know it.
33991 := I could destroy your prison once I'm out... if you wish.
33992 := I could try to find some other way to get you out of here.
33993 := Before I go, what's your name?
33994 := Light.
33995 := How do I know I could trust you?
33996 := It only takes once.
33997 := You have a point.
33998 := Look... you are *not* getting my body.
33999 := So what do you suggest?
34000 := I don't suppose you'll tell me, will you?
34001 := Out? Out to where? If you get out of here, your body's probably dead.
34002 := I'll have to do for what?
34003 := Ahhh! Na abds! Na abds!!
34004 := Na abds! Me hoot bad liaz!! Awnts!!
34005 := Ahh!! Me na awnts palkie bristag!! Bad liaz!!
34006 := *sniff* Me awnts na palkie. Me bad liaz.
34007 := *sniff* Me... me palkie. Is na gon-disen.
34008 := You... yooba me na abds?

34013 := Yooba palkie?  Bye-bye.
34014 := Na! Me hoot bad liaz! Awnts!!

34025 := Me no palkie awnts! Bristag me laesfa!
34026 := Yooba gon-disen! Bristag me laesfa!
34027 := [She points at a nearby service panel. You understand that she must have been sleeping in the ship's repair ducts.] Sasha stin-quiw there. It gon-disen.
34028 := Manlorey kesta-won Sasha na nuh ghis! Manlorey abds!
34029 := Manlorey bristag na laesfa. Manlorey bristag is na gon-disen!
34030 := Me palkie Manlorey bristag. Me na esowon in bristag laesfa.
34031 := Bristag me laesfa!!

34033 := [She seems uncertain.] Me palkie laesfa? Me palkie Dantooine?
34034 := [The girl seems to think about this, but says nothing.]

34036 := [The girl looks hopeful.] Me na palkie laesfa?
34037 := Bristag me laesfa! Yooba gon-disen!!

34041 := [The girl stares at you with wide eyes.] Is na gon-disen?
34042 := [She claps her hands excitedly.] Tabed me yooba, awnts!
34043 := [The girl points at her mouth.] Yooba kapsie... tabed me yooba.

34054 := [She covers her mouth with her hand.] Me na kapsie nuh ghis!

34058 := [She mimics an act which looks like she's chewing something.] Yum. Me yum gon-disen!
34059 := [She smiles.] Me awnts kesta-won yum nuh ghis!

34070 := Sasha na esowon in bristag. Bristag me laesfa.
34071 := [She points towards one of the Ebon Hawk's service panels.] Me laesfa. Me stin-quiw in laesfa.
34072 := [The girl looks puzzled. She gestures around her.] Bristag me laesfa!
34073 := [The girl looks puzzled. She gestures around her.] Bristag me laesfa!

34077 := [The girl waves a hand about, making a "swooshing" sound.] Bristag!
34078 := Bristag! Sasha na esowon in bristag. Bristag me laesfa.
34079 := [She points to herself.] Me esowon!
34080 := [The girl hides her face behind her hands for a moment.] Me na esowon!
34081 := [The girl hides her face behind her hands for a moment.] Me na esowon!
34082 := [The girl appears, unsure.] Yooba esowon nuh ghis?
34083 := Sasha na esowon in bristag. Bristag me laesfa.
34084 := [The girl looks at you quizzically, not understanding.]
34085 := [she nods] Waba soosa Sasha.
34086 := [The girl looks at you oddly, puzzled.]
34087 := [The girl points to herself.] Waaba soosa Sasha!
34088 := [The girl obviously doesn't understand you.]
34089 := Get out of here, whoever you are! Right now!!
34090 := A little girl? Where did you come from?
34091 := Hey! What are you doing here?!
34092 := I want you out of here! Off my ship!!
34093 := Alright, alright, calm down. What's the problem?
34094 := I don't care. Off you go. Now!!
34095 := Oh no, not the tears! *sigh* Alright, what's the problem?
34096 := I don't understand and I don't care. Get off my ship.
34097 := Suck it up, sister. Find someone who cares.
34098 := Calm down, little girl. I won't hurt you.
34099 := I don't understand what you're saying.
34100 := Err... sure, whatever you say.
34101 := I still don't understand you.
34102 := I've got to go.
34103 := Sorry, but you have to leave my ship.
34104 := *sigh* Alright, you can stay. For now.
34105 := Look... I can't understand you. You have to go.
34106 := I don't have time for this. Out!!
34107 := I don't care if you're scared. Go!
34108 := [Communicate with Sasha in her language.]
34109 := I'm tired of this game. I want you off my ship.
34110 := No, we'll have to talk later.
34111 := Why are you hiding on my ship? Sasha na esowon in bristag?
34112 := You came to the ship before. You were very scared. Why?
34113 := You left the Mandalorians? And hid here on the ship.
34114 := You don't want to leave. The Ebon Hawk is your home.
34115 := That's enough talk for now.
34116 := I haven't decided yet.
34117 := No, you don't have to go. For now.
34118 := You have to go now, Sasha. Yooba palkie nuh ghis, Sasha.
34119 := You sleep here on the ship? Yooba stin-quiw in bristag?
34120 := Why are you scared of the Mandalorians? Hoot bad liaz Manlorey?
34121 := They took you before? And hurt you?
34122 := The Mandalorian ship wasn't home. You didn't like it.
34123 := The Ebon Hawk is not your home, Sasha. Not your first home, anyway. Bristag na Sasha laesfa.
34124 := Tell me about your home before. Tabed me Sasha laesfa na nuh ghis.
34125 := Dantooine's been destroyed, Sasha...
34126 := I don't have time to go to Dantooine!
34127 := Dantooine? Maybe someone on Dantooine remembers you?
34128 := There is someone there who will take you home. Lur Arka kesta-won you laesfa.
34129 := If I have time.
34130 := If Lur Arka is still there. We'll see.
34131 := Yes, you can go home.
34132 := I don't have time to look around for someone who knows you.
34133 := Forget it! I'm not looking out for you... off my ship. Now!
34134 := I don't care what you do. Stay on the ship... just don't be any trouble.
34135 := You don't have to go, Sasha. You can stay... for now.
34136 := Dantooine? Maybe someone here remembers you?
34137 := [Try to learn Sasha's strange language.]
34138 := I give up.
34139 := Right. You can stay here, for now.
34140 := Say something else, Sasha.
34141 := You want to know about me, do you?
34142 := Tabed you? What do you mean?
34143 := I... don't understand. I'll have to think about it.
34144 := I'm... supposed to talk? To speak? What about?
34145 := You... want me to tell you a story? About what?
34146 := So... 'tabed' means 'tell me about'. I get it.
34147 := Many of the words you're speaking are Mandalorian...
34148 := The Mandalorians hurt you? Is that what you're saying?
34149 := You don't like the Mandalorians. I understand.
34150 := Okay. Mandalorians bad. I get it.
34151 := Manlorey... that's your word for Mandalorian? So you do know of them.
34152 := So you... hid from the Mandalorians? Or are hiding?
34153 := I can understand Mandalorian, but your words are all mixed up.
34154 := But are you a Mandalorian child, then?
34155 := Sasha isn't Mandalorian. Got it. But why don't you speak Basic, then?
34156 := So you're human. You learned the words from somewhere, though.
34157 := You... want some food now. You're hungry.
34158 := Nuh ghis? Is that all one phrase?
34159 := You're talking... down? I don't understand.
34160 := The floor? "Nuh ghis" means floor?
34161 := That could be anything. I don't get it.
34162 := You're not speaking... now? "Nuh ghis" means "now"! "Na nuh ghis" is not now... or "before"?
34163 := Yum? What kind of word is that?
34164 := You want something from elsewhere?
34165 := It's... a part of the ship? A room?
34166 := To... to chew? To bite? No, I don't get it.
34167 := Yum... you mean food, don't you? "Yum" is "food".
34168 := I understand. No, I won't hurt you.
34169 := "Na abds"... you said that when I first found you.
34170 := Yes, very bad. Stop that!
34171 := "Abds" means "hit"? Is that it?
34172 := No, I don't understand what you're getting at.
34173 := So... "abds" is "to hurt"? "Na abds" means "not hurt"? Is that it?
34174 := You like me. I understand.
34175 := You've said that before. What is "gon-disen"?
34176 := You already said that! What about it?
34177 := Something about me, yes, but what?
34178 := You're gon-disen? No, that's not it.
34179 := It's... something you like. Yes, "gon-disen" means you like it!
34180 := You're hiding in the starship. It's your home. I understand.
34181 := Laesfa... everything is safe? Is that it?
34182 := You... sleep there? "Laesfa" means "sleep"?
34183 := That panel? That's what "laesfa" means?
34184 := It's... no, I don't understand.
34185 := The starship... you mean home. The ship is your home.
34186 := The panel... all of this... it's your home. "Laesfa" means "home".
34187 := Bristag? What is that?
34188 := It's your home? Is that it?
34189 := It's a thing? Something around here?
34190 := No, I don't understand what you're getting at.
34191 := "Bristag"... it means "starship", doesn't it?
34192 := Esowon? Na esowon?
34193 := I need to hear more.
34194 := I see you? Or you see me?
34195 := You... don't see? No, that's not it, is it?
34196 := I understand. "Esowon" is "see" but "na esowon" is "hide".
34197 := You... you're hiding! "Na esowon" is "hide"!
34198 := I didn't get all of that, but sure.
34199 := Yes, I see now. Me esowon nuh ghis.
34200 := Where are you from, Sasha? Taris?
34201 := Where are you from? Can you tell me that?
34202 := How did you get on the ship, Sasha?
34203 := You're a stowaway, aren't you? How long have you been here?
34204 := Does the name Lur Arka ring a bell? What about Rundil ot Sulem?
34205 := Sasha... your name is Sasha, right?
34206 := Can you tell me your name?
34207 := [Point to yourself.] My name is <FirstName>. You are...?
34208 := Do you know a Twi'lek by the name of Lur Arka Sulas?
34209 := Jor Ul
34210 := Kurax
34211 := Lurze
34212 := Kesh
34213 := Nubassa
34214 := Sasha
34215 := Gizka Poison
34216 := Spice
34217 := There are several kilograms of illegal spice here, tightly wrapped and sealed.
34218 := Strange Box
34219 := The box is rather light and small, made out of an odd metal allow. It appears to have no lock and could probably be opened quite easily.
34220 := Spice container
34221 := This locker is made of a very sturdy metal and has a complex lock with an attached pad. It will likely be very difficult to break into without the proper code.

34233 := There's something behind here.
34234 := Damn - another Dark Jedi! I'll try to hold him off, you get to the escape pods! Go!
34235 := You're wounded! You better use a medpac to heal yourself before we go any farther.
34236 := Press the "X" button to target yourself and bring up an action menu. Select "Use Item", then select "medpac" from the list of items.
34237 := How do I use a medpack?
34238 := Okay.
34239 := Its maintenance program engaged, the droid scurries about in a vain effort to repair the massive damage to the ship. You cannot reprogram it again.
34240 := This maintenance droid is damaged.
34241 := You leave it alone for now.
34242 := [Failure] You don't have any repair parts. You leave the droid alone for now.

34248 := Quick - get we have to get to the escape pods before it's too late!
34249 := Whenever you gain experience in the game, the rest of your party will as well. You have the option of levelling them up manually, or you can use the default system. 
34250 := But enough of this. We need to get moving!
34251 := Go ahead and level up before we move on. Press [START] then go to the CHARACTER menu and follow the instructions on the screen.
34252 := Nice job. You've gained quite a bit of experience so far. You want me to show you how to apply that experience to improve your skills?
34253 := Whenever you have enough experience to level up, your character portrait will begin to flash. Press [START] then go to the CHARACTER menu to level up.
34254 := If you have enough experience points, you can press "A" to level your character up from this screen.
34255 := Good. Go ahead and level up now before we continue.
34256 := Those Sith won't know what hit 'em!
34257 := To slice into most computers you'll need computer spikes. The higher your computer skill, the less spikes it takes to override the system.
34258 := Once you have your equipment, come speak to me again.
34259 := I know all about your reputation, how you used to smuggle spice and blasters along the Corellian Run. I guess the Republic figured since they couldn't catch you, they might as well hire you.
34260 := And I'll admit, the Republic is in desperate need of someone with your kind of skills. Desperate enough to overlook your shady past.
34261 := I heard what everyone's saying about you: you've explored the farthest reaches of the galaxy, you've visited planets I've never even heard of.
34262 := People with your skills and abilities are hard to find; it's no wonder the Republic recruited you for this mission. But now's the time to prove yourself!
34263 := I've heard all about your reputation: elite combat training, tops in your class. It's no wonder you were hand picked for this mission.
34264 := Word is the officers haven't seen a recruit with your kind of potential in twenty years. But all that potential doesn't mean a thing if you can't deliver when it counts!
34265 := Yes, show me how.
34266 := Can you repeat that?
34267 := I understand.
34268 := I already know how to do that.
34269 := Okay, give me some tips.
34270 := Can you repeat that?
34271 := Okay. Let's get to the fighting!
34272 := Forget the tips. Let's just get to the fighting!

34409 := You there, human... you are the one flying the Ebon Hawk now? I saw you disembarking earlier.
34410 := Whoa, now! You're just going to have to make a little time, human. We've been waiting for this shipment for over a month.
34411 := I suppose we should be grateful that the shipment survived Taris at all, though, right? Anyway... hand it over and let's finish this.
34412 := Wait a minute... don't you work for Davik? Just how is it you happen to be flying the Ebon Hawk, anyway?
34413 := I'm not here to give you any trouble, human. The people I represent and Davik had an arrangement... I just want to know what the status of it is.
34414 := Fair enough. To be honest, I don't really care what happened to Davik or how you got the ship. I'm interested in something else.
34415 := Well, when a planet explodes, you've got to expect a few changes. Davik's dead, hey? Maybe you can still help me with something.
34416 := We had arranged for several kilograms of spice to be shipped to us here aboard the Ebon Hawk. Perhaps Davik left it on board?
34417 := I suspect if it is, it would be in the container we gave him. Locked and requiring a code. Might you have seen such a thing, human?
34418 := Are you sure? The people I represent could make it well worth your while.
34419 := That is unfortunate. The people I represent will be... displeased. They've already lost their interests on Taris, after all.
34420 := But it is your choice, human. Pray that no-one takes your refusal personally.
34421 := Excellent. Set the code on the container to "Red-47". When you get the spice, bring it to me here... I'll wait for you.
34422 := One thousand credits... and perhaps more, if you're interested. What do you say to that?
34423 := My employers would be disappointed, no doubt. Have you another use for the spice, human? Consider carefully.
34424 := So you do. That does, indeed, look like the amount that Davik promised. Very well... 1000 credits is yours in exchange for the spice.
34425 := The authorities? Do you mean the Sith? This is Korriban, human... the Sith here have no interest in smuggling.
34426 := But I have no desire, either, for you to take the package back into Republic space. Extortion or no, I will give you 1500 credits... but no more.
34427 := Are you certain? It is odd to meet a human who is uninterested in free credits. But have it your way.
34428 := Done and done, human. Here you are.
34429 := Allow me to take the spice off your hands. My employers will be most pleased. Tell me... might you be interested in earning more credits?
34430 := Not interested in the smuggling business, are we? You do know the history of the Ebon Hawk, I assume? Well, no matter.
34431 := It is your decision. I wish you well, human, and thank you for the service you have provided.
34432 := It is a simple courier mission. Motta the Hutt on Tatooine awaits delivery of a box that I hold. The spice was his, and the box is his repayment.
34433 := There is no danger involved, human, so long as you do not attempt to open the box yourself. I'm sure Motta will pay you what was promised to Davik for the delivery. I believe 2000 credits was the agreed upon sum.
34434 := He can be found in Anchorhead, though I am uncertain exactly where. He should not be difficult to spot, fat as he is.
34435 := *Never* open the box. Opening the box would be horribly bad.
34436 := It is not a bomb. Just do not open it... that is all I can say. It represents no danger to you so long as it remains closed.
34437 := I suppose I would eventually have to, should you refuse. You are already here, however, and you have a ship... it is most convenient to have you deliver the box.
34438 := Very good. I will have some of my workers load the box onto the Ebon Hawk for you. It will be waiting there for you. Remember: do not open the box!
34439 := Now I must go. My employers thank you for your assistance.
34440 := [Failure] You may not have been part of the original arrangement, human, but our terms for you are no different. 1000 credits, no more.
34441 := Are you sure you want to do that? This is not something you can sell at your nearest kiosk, human. Do you have the contacts to make such a sale?
34442 := My employers will be most disappointed if this spice turns up elsewhere. The price we offer is a fair one.
34443 := Then you leave me no choice. I will take that spice now, thank you.
34444 := [Success] I... suppose we should... count ourselves fortunate that you're here to deliver on Davik's promise at all. 1500 credits, human, but no more.
34445 := [Success] I suppose we should count ourselves fortunate that you're here to deliver on Davik's promise at all. 1500 credits, human, but no more.
34446 := Here you are. You drive a hard bargain, human.
34447 := Is that so? Well, you can tell Davik that my people are spitting plasma over this. We've been waiting for this shipment for a month, now.
34448 := Name's Lurze, not that it's important. I don't know you and you don't know me. What's important is that we've been waiting for this shipment for a month, now.
34449 := There you are. Do you have the spice, human?
34450 := No? Could you be persuaded to continue looking for it? The spice it carries is most eagerly awaited by my employers.
34451 := I don't have time to talk.
34452 := I'm no smuggler, if that's what you're implying.
34453 := Look, I don't want any trouble, okay?
34454 := I'm sure we could work out something, if you're interested.
34455 := There is no arrangement. The Ebon Hawk belongs to me, now.
34456 := What business is it of yours? The Ebon Hawk is mine, now.
34457 := Davik's dead, I presume. I stole the Ebon Hawk from him.
34458 := There's nothing like that on the ship.
34459 := I don't want to get involved in this.
34460 := Fine. I'll take a look for your container.
34461 := I said I didn't want to get involved.
34462 := How well worth my while?
34463 := I could take a look for it.
34464 := I may have. How much is it worth to you?
34465 := And if I refuse?
34466 := I already opened that container. I have the spice right here.
34467 := Make it 2000 credits or I hand this package over to the authorities.
34468 := Just take the spice. I don't want it or your credits.
34469 := Fair enough. 1000 credits it is.
34470 := Get out of my sight, scum.
34471 := No, not really.
34472 := Maybe. Tell me more.
34473 := Forget it. Not interested.
34474 := Where can I find this Motta?
34475 := What happens if I open the box?
34476 := But what would happen? Is it a bomb?
34477 := Why don't you just bring it to him yourself?
34478 := Alright. I'll do it.
34479 := [Persuade] I don't work for Davik, remember? I want more.
34480 := Then I guess I'll be keeping the spice.
34481 := I'll take my chances.
34482 := [Force Persuade] I think you want to offer me a higher price.
34483 := You obviously have me mistaken for someone else.
34484 := Hand what over? What are you talking about?
34485 := Yes, the Ebon Hawk is my ship.
34486 := Who wants to know?
34487 := I couldn't find your container.
34488 := No, I don't think so.
34489 := I'll try looking again.
34490 := Oh, wait, I have it right here...
34491 := I've decided I don't want to get involved in this.
34492 := Not yet, but I'll look for it.
34493 := Yes, I do.
34494 := Greetings once again. Might you have a Pazaak deck? I would be most interested in some idle entertainment, sentient.
34495 := You still don't have a deck? Then why are you bothering me? Until you get a deck we have nothing to discuss.
34496 := Greetings once again. Might you have a Pazaak deck? I would be most interested in some idle entertainment, sentient.
34497 := Excellent. Let us begin.
34498 := Ahhh, it is a good day, sentient, is it not? I always find the vindication of my skill to be pleasing. You have my condolences.
34499 := As you wish. I certainly can always use the credits.
34500 := A lucky hand. I will have to try a little harder next time if I am going to beat you... and I will, I am quite sure. Shall we try again?
34501 := It seems I have been bested at my own game. Fair enough, sentient... you are the superior player. I do not think we need to play any more games to continue proving the point.
34502 := *sigh* I am down a considerable number of credits, sentient. I am not in the mood to answer your queries, to be quite honest.
34503 := And put even more credits into your pocket? Are you joking, sentient? I know when I am beaten.
34504 := So please... find some other player to wring dry. I'll look for something a little less challenging, myself.
34505 := Greetings, sentient. Are you willing to engage in a hand of Pazaak? I am afraid there are few takers on Korriban... it would be good to have a little fun, for once.
34506 := Come back anytime, sentient. I'm always willing to play.
34507 := Yes, yes, take my credits and go.
34508 := I see. I apologize, but I do not have a spare. Should you ever acquire a deck, do come and see me.
34509 := There are others here to answer your questions, sentient. To be honest, if we are not going to engage in some entertaining sport, I would rather be alone.
34510 := I am known as Toll Apkar. If you must know, I am quite proficient at Pazaak. I would not wish to begin a game under false pretenses.
34511 := Ahhh, it is a good day, sentient, is it not? I always find the vindication of my skill to be pleasing. You have my condolences.
34512 := As you wish. I certainly can always use the credits.
34513 := A lucky hand. I will have to try a little harder next time if I am going to beat you... and I will, I am quite sure. Shall we try again?
34514 := It seems I have been bested at my own game. Fair enough, sentient... you are the superior player and here is your reward. I do not think we need to play any more games to continue proving the point.
34515 := *sigh* I am down a considerable number of credits, sentient. I am not in the mood to answer your queries, to be quite honest.

34517 := So please... find some other player to wring dry. I'll look for something a little less challenging, myself.
34518 := I don't have a deck yet.
34519 := Who are you again?
34520 := Sorry, not interested right now. 
34521 := Let's play.
34522 := Deal the cards - I'm not leaving just yet!
34523 := You think it was luck? Let's do it again!
34524 := How about you answer some of my questions then?
34525 := Oh come on... one more game!
34526 := Goodbye.
34527 := I want to play Pazaak, but I don't have a deck.
34528 := I want to ask you some questions.

34718 := The datapad appears to be the journal of a Sith archaeologist by the name of Veren Gal. Most of it consists of uninteresting notes on the geology of the tomb's caverns, but the final entry is as follows:

"Strangely enough, I've found traces of Therangen in the tomb. This is an unstable black rock used as fuel by lesser races... perhaps the ancient Sith on Korriban used it as a power source? It is a volatile and dangerous substance, and reacts violently to fire. I will have to be careful."
34719 := This datapad seems to have once belonged to an enterprising young Sith student who had ventured into the tomb in search of Ajunta Pall's sword. One of his entries is of particular note:

"There has got to be a way to get past this obelisk blocking the bridge! It seems to be made of some kind of unstable material... I'm willing to bet some kind of energy discharge will set it off. Blaster fire isn't doing the trick, however. I'll have to try some kind of explosive. I just hope that guard droid over there is as defunct as it looks."

34794 := This datapad appears to be the journal of a Sith who quite obviously did not make it past this portion of his final test. Most of the journal consists of the Sith's account of gaining enough prestige with Master Uthar to take this test... only the final entry appears to concern the test, itself:

"It seems I need to get across the pool of acid in the central chamber if I am to complete my test, here, but that is not going to be easy. The runes name one obelisk the 'Pillar of Fire'... while the other is the 'Pillar of Ice'. I can only assume that one of the pillars leads to a way to remove the acid pool. Fire or ice... wouldn't fire create toxic fumes? I'm not sure. Maybe freezing the pool would be safer. Well... I'll worry about that once I bypass the terentatek beasts. If I can. I suppose it's now or never."

35057 := Greetings again, off-worlder. Have you happened upon any exotic species since we last spoke?
35058 := Poor, to tell the truth. I am beginning to think we shall have no species at all in our zoological exhibit. *sigh*
35059 := Greetings! Forgive me if this seems an odd question, off-worlder, but might you have any exotic species for sale? Nothing dangerous, mind you.
35060 := Well, if you do come across something potentially interesting, please remember me. My name is Nubassa. I hope to see you again!
35061 := Gizka? You speak of the small, bipedal amphibians with the overly high reproductive rate, correct? Oh, no, I am afraid I cannot take those.
35062 := A compatriot of mine made the mistake of purchasing a pair of such creatures several months ago. Within weeks our storage facilities were nearly overrun.
35063 := If you are in possession of such creatures, I hope you keep them separated. If not, then you have my condolences.
35064 := My pleasure. Should you encounter some other exotic species, do please let me know.
35065 := [Success] Hmm. But maybe we could use these gizka, after all. It is better then having nothing at all to show, I suppose.
35066 := Since they are so difficult to maintain, however, I would ask that you provide 100 credits. Then I will take them off your hands.
35067 := [Failure] That is unfair of you to ask, off-worlder. You are attempting to sell me something I have already stated I do not need.
35068 := [Success] I... suppose it is natural for off-worlders to desire commerce, even when it is unfair. Very well, I shall do as you ask, in the interest of peace.
35069 := Here are your credits. I shall send someone by to remove the gizka from your vessel. Good day, off-worlder.
35070 := [Failure] The cost of maintaining such creatures is very high. I would be removing pests for you at my own expense?
35071 := [Success] *sigh* I suppose it is better than nothing. We must have some creatures in our exhibit, after all.
35072 := I shall send some of my people by to remove the gizka on your vessel. Thank you for your co-operation.
35073 := [Failure] I... I do not... no, I am afraid that you are mistaken. I do require coin to compensate for my aid. These gizka are not easy to manage.
35074 := [Success] What am I thinking? It is impertinent of me to ask you for credits when you are attempting to make a sale. My apologies.
35075 := You do not even have 100 credits? Then you are in dire straits, indeed. You certainly do not need these pests on your vessel.
35076 := In the interest of maintaining peace, I shall remove them and use what I can. Thank you for your assistance, off-worlder... I hope your situation improves soon.
35077 := Very well. It is a pleasure doing business with you... I will have my people show up to remove your gizka as soon as possible.
35078 := Thank you very much. For an off-worlder, interacting with you has been most pleasant.
35079 := [Failure] I have never heard of such a creature. I suspect you are merely desperate to offload your difficult circumstance onto another. Shame on you, off-worlder!
35080 := [Success] They do not? Well, that is marvelous news! We would have the benefit of obtaining the gizka without the inconvenience of their numbers!
35081 := If you wish, I will send some others over to your vessels right away to remove the gizka.
35082 := [Failure] I am willing to take these gizka off your hands because of their unusual nature... I certainly will not purchase them!
35083 := As you wish. Our negotiation is hereby suspended.
35084 := [Success] Ah. I hope 100 credits will be sufficient, then? I realize that such a rare strain of gizka might be worth more, but it is all I can afford.
35085 := Thank you for your assistance, off-worlder. Dealing with you has proven far more pleasureable than I anticipated.
35086 := [Failure] I do not think so, no. They have proven to be far too much trouble in the past.
35087 := [Success] *sigh* I suppose it would. I am not looking forward to the trouble this will cause, but if it will help you out... I will do what I can.
35088 := I shall send some people by your vessel shortly to remove the gizka. Good day to you, off-worlder.
35089 := [Success] I... suppose having a few of the creatures would not be of harm. We do have experience handling them now, I suppose.
35090 := I am sure you would. They are practically a nuisance. I have no need of them, however, as I stated.
35091 := Ah, good question. The Selkath have little exposure to life from other planets, you see, but our government hopes to change that.
35092 := We are setting up a zoological compound for visitation by the public, and are hoping to stock it with non-offensive foreign creatures of all types.
35093 := The only problem right now is actually procuring the exotic species we need. Selkath import restrictions are quite prohibitive, to say the least.
35094 := I would not use such a harsh word, off-worlder. Let us say that I am interested in engaging in private trade. That is allowed, according to our laws.
35095 := Finding off-worlders that deal in such trade is most difficult, however. I have become quite desperate. Might you have what I seek?
35096 := Anything non-sentient and non-carnivorous will do, though creatures that are easy to manage are preferred. Is that understandable?
35097 := How has the hunt been?
35098 := I don't have time for questions.
35099 := I have some gizka, if you're interested.
35100 := Thanks anyway, then.
35101 := [Force Persuade] But you want to take these gizka off my hands.
35102 := [Persuade] You want me to *pay* you? How about you give me 100 credits?
35103 := [Persuade] I was hoping to sell them. How about we just call it even?
35104 := Fine. 100 credits it is.
35105 := [Force Persuade] You don't need any credits to take them.
35106 := But... I actually don't have 100 credits.
35107 := Deal. I want those things off my ship as soon as possible.
35108 := [Persuade/Lie] But these are special gizka. They don't reproduce like the others do.
35109 := Sounds good to me.
35110 := [Persuade] The gizka are for *sale*... they aren't free.
35111 := Forget it. No deal.
35112 := Fine, take them, then.
35113 := [Persuade] Is there no way I can convince you to take them off my hands?
35114 := [Persuade] How about if I paid you 100 credits as well? Would that help?
35115 := Actually, I would *really* like to get rid of these creatures.
35116 := No, I don't have anything for you.
35117 := Why would you want to buy animals?
35118 := So you want to smuggle them in?
35119 := Exotic species? What sorts of exotic species?

35126 := Of course. The Ahto City Visitor's Provisional Stand is here to service you, the customer.
35127 := Manaan is the homeworld of we Selkath. It is here that our race has lived and thrived for uncounted millenia. With our valuable supply of kolto, we have become an important player in intragalactic politics.
35128 := We have taken a neutral stance in the current galactic war between the Sith and the Republic as we believe that violence is not a permanent solution.
35129 := Is there another way in which I can assist you?
35130 := Ahto City is the center of trade and commerce for all of Manaan. Indeed, for this entire sector! It is the only known source of kolto in the galaxy, and thus one of its most important worlds.
35131 := This city was constructed by we Selkath so that other races and cultures could experience the wonders that Manaan has to offer.
35132 := Greetings human, and welcome to the Ahto City Visitor's Provisional Stand. We are here to provide visitors with all manner of indigenous treats and products produced right here on Manaan.
35133 := We carry all manner of foods and provisions, and have contacts with resellers across the world to provide you, the customer, with the best shopping experience possible.
35134 := Nothing for now.
35135 := I would like to sell you something.

Now everyone has to know how to cycle the water out of one room and into the adjoining one for each of the three rooms in sequence without accidental flooding the room they're in. We lost seven troopers just this week!
  Next time I'm there you better show me how to do it properly! I can't afford to lose any more of my aides while trying to get to the Selkath!

35436 := We don't want the Sith to cut off our escape route. We'll stay here and hold this docking bay. You get in there and find Bastila!
35437 := You made it! Several Jedi have already gone ahead into the Star Forge. We have to strike while we still have the element of surprise!
35438 := We have to find Malak! A victory by the Republic fleet won't mean anything if the Dark Lord gets away.
35439 := If we don't stop Bastila from using her Battle Meditation the entire Republic fleet will be wiped out!
35440 := Come on, before they...
35441 := We'll deal with these Sith - you get into the Star Forge and find Malak!

35444 := The Sith will want to cut off our escape. We'll stay here and protect the ships so we can get out of here once you stop Bastila!
35445 := Lord Malak, a team of Jedi have penetrated our defenses! Their fighters have landed on the Star Forge.
35446 := This is not unexpected. The Jedi are formidable opponents. Send the Star Forge's battle droids to deal with them.
35447 := Lord Malak, forgive me... but how can mere droids be a match for the Jedi?
35448 := You underestimate the power of the Star Forge's droid army. Dispatch the droids.
35449 := Of course, Lord Malak.
35450 := The Jedi have invaded the Star Forge. Destroy them. Destroy them all.

35486 := N-no, Lord Malak. The droids could not stop them.
35487 := Strange. I did not think there were any among the Order who could survive an attack by an army of the Star Forge's battle droids.
35488 := It... it was Revan, Lord Malak. Your old master is with the Jedi, here on the Star Forge!
35489 := Yes... that would explain why the droids failed. Revan always was strong in the Force. Very well - send out all available troops. The apprentices, as well.
35490 := Do you... do you think they can stop Revan, Lord Malak?
35491 := Of course not! But they will slow Revan down. That will give me the time I need to fully prepare the Star Forge's defenses.
35492 := I am curious to see the true extent of this space station's capabilities. One as powerful as my old master will make an interesting test subject.

35606 := Of... of course not my Lord Malak.  I will do as you command. But it will take several hours to position our fleet.
35607 := Then I suggest you begin immediately. You are dismissed, Admiral.     
35608 := Yes, Lord Malak.

35614 := Lord Malak, the Star Forge is operating at 200% capacity - far beyond our expectations.
35615 := I am more interested in the young Jedi Bastila and her Battle Meditation. Have you learned how she escaped the destruction of Taris?
35616 := She was aided by Carth Onasi, a decorated war hero of the Republic and a legendary soldier. During the Mandalore Wars he was honored many times for his bravery.
35617 := You know this man?
35618 := Yes, Lord Malak. He served under me when I still followed the Republic. You could say I was his mentor.
35619 := Interesting. How did you acquire this information, Admiral?
35620 := An eye witness, Lord Malak.
35621 := Calo Nord, a bounty hunter, was there when Bastila and Carth escaped the planet. Apparently they left him for dead.
35622 := A Jedi and a war hero - it's a wonder you survived the encounter.
35623 := I am hard to kill, Lord Malak.
35624 := Calo has agreed to help us capture the young Bastila - for a very hefty fee, of course. But I assure you he is well worth the price. His reputation as a bounty hunter is well earned.
35625 := Her companions are nothing to me, Calo - but I desire the young Jedi taken alive if at all possible.
35626 := Lord Malak, forgive me. There is something else. May we have a private audience away from the ears of the common soldiers?
35627 := I trust you are not wasting my time, Admiral Karath.
35628 := I promise you will be very interested in what Calo has to tell you about Bastila's other companions, Lord Malak.

35638 := Shall I hire another bounty hunter, Lord Malak?
35639 := No mere bounty hunter can stand against a Jedi. I shall not make the same mistake again.
35640 := My apprentice, Darth Bandon, shall take care of our young Jedi friend.

35650 := You are strong, child. But I will break you.
35651 := I'll never fall to the dark side! 
35652 := You think torture will turn me, Malak? You are a fool.
35653 := Torture?  No, dear Bastila.  You misunderstand.  This is but a taste of the dark side to whet your appetite. ## When you finally swear loyalty to me, it will be willingly.
35654 := When you finally swear loyalty to me, it will be willingly.
35655 := Never!
35656 := Such resolve in your words, but I see the truth in your heart.  The dark side calls to you, Bastila.  You hunger to taste it. ## Become my apprentice, and all its power can be yours!
35657 := Become my apprentice, and all its power can be yours!
35658 :=  
35659 := Lord Malak, the preparations are nearly complete. Everyday the Star Forge adds more ships to our fleet, it is operating at nearly 300% of our projections. ## The fleet is assembling around the Star Forge, and awaits your instructions.
35660 := The fleet is assembling around the Star Forge, and awaits your instructions.
Malak: Patience, Commander.
35661 := My new apprentice is nearly ready. 
35662 := Once Bastila joins her Battle Meditation to our enormous fleet, we shall be invincible. Then we shall begin our final conquest of the Core Worlds, and the Republic will be crushed forever.
35663 := As you wish, Lord Malak.
35664 :=   
35665 :=  
35666 := The Star Forge... I've never seen anything like it.
35667 := I'm transmitting these coordinates to Admiral Dodonna.  Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet.
35668 := Message is away. Now we can just wait for the Republic to show up. We should be safe here - we're outside their sensor range.
35669 := What's that?

35675 := This may be a rough landing.
35676 := M12aa
35677 := The Republic Fleet must have got the message I sent as we were crashing onto that planet. I'm picking up a transmission from them now.
35678 := This is Admiral Forn Dodonna to the Ebon Hawk, do you read us?
35679 := Admiral Dodonna, this is Carth Onasi. We are receiving your transmission.
35680 := Carth, I'm glad to see you're still alive. We've begun our assault on the Star Forge, but we're taking heavy losses. How did the Sith ever manage to build something of this scope!
35681 := The Star Forge wasn't constructed by the Sith, Admiral. We don't have time for me to fully explain it, but that space station is far older than you can imagine.
35682 := Maybe we should pull the fleet back and retreat. I don't know if we have the firepower to go up against this alien technology.
35683 := You can't do that, Admiral.  The Star Forge is a factory of immense power.  It's been churning out the capital ships, snub fighters and assault droids that have powered the Sith war effort. ## You have to destroy the Star Forge now or you'll be fighting an unending wave of reinforcements.
35684 := You have to destroy the Star Forge now or you'll be fighting an unending wave of reinforcements.
35685 := Then I guess we have no choice.  But it isn't going to be easy. ## I can't even get our capital ships into position to start bombarding the Star Forge. ## The Sith fleet is too well organized.  It's like they can guess our every move and counter our every strategy.
35686 := I can't even get our capital ships into position to start bombarding the Star Forge.
35687 := The Sith fleet is too well organized. It's like they can guess our every move and counter our every strategy.
35688 := It's because of Bastila, Admiral.  She turned to the dark side and become Malak's apprentice. ## We suspect she's somewhere on that space station right now, ## using her Battle Meditation against you and your fleet.
35689 := We suspect she's somewhere on that space station right now, 
35690 := using her Battle Meditation against you and your fleet.
35691 := This is Master Vandar. A number of Jedi Knights have joined our fleet under his command.
35692 := If Bastila is using her power to augment the Sith then Malak's fleet is invincible. Our only hope is to somehow stop Bastila from using her Battle Meditation.
35693 := How can we do that if she's on the space station?
35694 := I will send a squadron of Jedi Knights to the Star Forge to find Bastila. Their small ships will be able to fly through the Sith blockade and dock on the space station.
35695 := If they can find Bastila, they may be able to distract her attention from the battle overhead.
35696 := I hate to ask you this after all you've done, Carth, but the Jedi may need all the help they can get...
35697 := Don't worry, Admiral. The Ebon Hawk and her crew are going to see this through to the end!
35698 := And may the Force be with you.
35699 := And may the Force be with you.
35700 := The Republic Fleet must have got the message Carth sent as we were crashing onto that planet. Maybe we can use their arrival to our advantage. 
35701 := This is Admiral Forn Dodonna to the Ebon Hawk, do you read us?
35702 := Admiral Dodonna, this is Bastila Shan of the Jedi Order. We are receiving your transmission.
35703 := It is good to hear your voice Bastila. We had thought you were lost to us. Carth's transmission reported that Malak had taken you prisoner.
35704 := The Jedi sent to rescue me from the Dark Lord did their job well - though I am sorry to report Carth did not survive the mission.
35705 := His loss is a great blow to the Republic. We could have used him in this battle.
35706 := We were about to pull back.
35707 := We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.
35708 := Don't pull back, Admiral. You have to attack the Star Forge now, otherwise the Sith will use it's power to destroy the Republic.
35709 := I'll try to press the attack but we can't hold out much longer, Bastila. Not unless you can use your Battle Meditation to turn the tide.
35710 := This is Master Vandar. A number of Jedi Knights have joined the fleet, under his command.
35711 := Bastila's power could help you win this battle, Admiral, but it will mean nothing if Malak escapes. Destroying the Star Forge is secondary to stopping the Sith threat once and for all.
35712 := What are you proposing?
35713 := A small squadron of Jedi Knights in snub fighters could penetrate the Sith blockade and dock on the space station. If they can find Malak we can end the threat of the Sith
35714 := ...forever.
35715 := I'll order the fleet to press the attack and provide some cover for your fighters. But what of Bastila and her Battle Meditation?
35716 := Bastila, you and... the Padawan... should join us. We will need the combined strength of our entire Order to defeat Malak.
35717 := As you wish, Master Vandar.
35718 := And may the Force be with you.
35719 := The fools! Even Master Vandar did not realize you have reclaimed you identity as the Dark Lord!
35720 := The Jedi strike team and the Republic forces will provide the perfect distraction as we hunt down your ex-apprentice. And once we have slain Malak, I can use my Battle Meditation
35721 := and the power of the Star Forge to crush the Republic fleet.
35722 := All our enemies will be destroyed in a single glorious day!
35723 := There - a break in the Sith formations! Green squadron, move in!
35724 := Green squadron moving in.
35725 := Republic Soldier1
35726 := Republic Soldier2
35727 := Republic Soldier3
35728 := The tide of the battle is turning against us. The entire Sith fleet reacts instantly to our every strategy. Every fighter and capital ship attack in perfect unison. I've never seen such military precision!
35729 := I have - but never from the Sith. It's almost as if... ## No! Bastila is using her Battle Meditation against us!
35730 := No! Bastila is using her Battle Meditation against us!
35731 := What? Impossible! She's on our side!
35732 := Not anymore, Admiral. I sensed something different about Bastila during her transmission, but I thought I was only feeling the evil presence of the Star Forge itself. I see now I was wrong.
35733 := Bastila has turned to the dark side, Admiral. ## You have to give the order to retreat!
35734 := You have to give the order to retreat!
35735 := I can't do that. This might be our only chance to destroy the Star Forge - we can't withdraw. We can't.
35736 := Then you will lose.
35737 := We've lost another capital ship - it's hopeless! ## All Republic forces pull back! Pull back!
35738 := All Republic forces pull back! Pull back!
35739 := It is too late to retreat, Admiral. The Sith armada has cut us off. ## There is no escape for us now.
35740 := There is no escape for us now.
35741 := Then the Republic is doomed.
35742 := Malak is dead - all hail the return of Darth Revan, the true Lord of the Sith!
35743 := The Sith bow before you, you have reclaimed your rightful throne!  The Jedi Order is in tatters ## it is only a matter of time until your Sith minions wipe them from the face of the galaxy. ## The Republic fleet is decimated, the Core Worlds are defenseless against us!  

35744 := All hail Lord Revan!  All hail Lord Revan!  All hail Lord Revan! 
35745 := The Republic fleet is decimated, the Core Worlds are defenseless against us! 
35746 := Admiral Dodonna - we've hit their main orbital stabilizers!
35747 := Everyone pull back - I don't want to lose any ships when that space station goes down!
35748 := We did it, Vandar - the Sith are routed and the Star Forge destroyed!
35749 := But at what cost, Admiral? Where is the Ebon Hawk and her crew?
35750 := Republic Officer1
35751 := Republic Officer2
35752 := Republic Officer3
35753 := Republic Officer4
35754 := You have defeated Malak, destroyed the Star Forge and broken the spirit of the Sith! ## For this I am proud to present you each with the Cross of Glory. ## The highest honor the Republic can bestow.
35755 := For this I am proud to present you each with the Cross of Glory...
35756 := ...the highest honor the Republic can bestow.
35757 := From Couruscant to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rims you will be known as the saviors of the Republic!
35758 := On behalf of the Jedi Council, defenders of the galaxy and sworn protectors of the Republic...
35759 := ...I too would like to honor you for your actions.
35760 := We Jedi now have another tale to weave...
35761 := ...into the grand history of our eternal Order - the Redemption...
35762 := of Revan, the prodigal knight.
35763 := Wherever you go you will be recognized...
35764 := as the saviors of the galaxy, the heroes of our age. But you must remain ever vigilant...

35783 := The Sith searched this building once. Fortunately they didn't care that we were here illegally, and they left us alone.
35784 := A human? We do not see many of your kind in this building... unless they are hiding out from someone.
35785 := Sorry, human, but I do not wish to engage in conversation with you. Residents of this complex prefer to keep to themselves.
35786 := Please, don't hurt me. I have nothing of value in here. Look for yourself and see!
35787 := Please, don't take me in for questioning... I don't know anything! I swear!
35788 := Sith come here once, but they not arrest anyone. They just searching for spies, maybe. No spies here - only aliens hiding out.
35789 := You human? This strange. We not see humans here much. You hiding out from someone, I guess.
35790 := Me too busy to talk, human. Me got stuff to do.
35791 := You here to steal stuff? Me not have anything. You look. You see.
35792 := Me not know anything! No arrest me. No arrest me!
35793 := They say Taris is the Coruscant of the Outer Rim. But this world is nothing but crumbling buildings and urban waste!
35794 := Had I known of the Tarisian attitudes towards aliens I would never have come to visit this world. Now I'm stuck here because of the quarantine!
35795 := On my home world I lived in a splendid castle. But here on this planet I'm forced to hide out in this... this slum!
35796 := Hmph... humans breaking into my apartment. If it wasn't illegal for me to be here, I'd report you to the authorities.
35797 := Greetings, officer. Rest assured, if I see anything of interest to the Sith I will be report it to the proper authorities.
35798 := I hate this world. They treat us aliens like scum. As soon as the Sith quarantine is over, I'm leaving for good!
35799 := I know some Twi'leks who've been given special permission to live in the Upper City. They don't have to hide out in a dump like this.
35800 := Before the Sith arrived there was talk of changing Taris' alien restriction laws. But I guess that probably won't happen now.
35801 := Don't hurt me! Just... just take what you want. I won't try to stop you.
35802 := Oh... uh... hello, officer. Making another patrol, are you? Well, I won't get in your way.
35803 := Right. I'm <FullName>, by the way. How did we get here?
35804 := Back again? So, what can I do for you? You want to see what I have in stock?
35805 := Well, I don't see too many of your kind around here. Most of the residents in this run down old apartment are illegal aliens. My name is Larrim, by the way.
35806 := Hey, I wasn't trying to pry or anything. I know people here like their privacy. It's just that I might be able to help you out.
35807 := You want to see what I have in stock? I know my kiosk isn't much to look at, but my prices are reasonable and the merchandise is sound.
35808 := See you around. Come on back if you need any equipment. I've got some merchandise you might be interested in.
35809 := No problem. Just step on up and have a peek.
35810 := Questions? I'd rather not. It might be bad for business if people saw me answering a bunch of questions for a human.
35811 := Most of the residents here are illegal aliens, questions are frowned on. I don't want to lose the trust of my customers. If you really need information, go talk to Kadir the janitor.
35812 := He's bordering on senile so all the residents figure he's harmless. They won't mind you talking to him, and he might be able to help you out with your questions.
35813 := By law, most aliens aren't allowed to have a residence in the Upper City of Taris. They allow a few of us Twi'leks up here, but for the most part it's humans only.
35814 := But no self-respecting Upper City human would want to live in the apartments in this dump. So the landlord has been renting out the apartments illegally to aliens.
35815 := Better than letting them sit empty, I guess. Otherwise you get squatters and people hiding out from the authorities living in the abandoned apartments, and they don't pay rent.
35816 := The Taris authorities pretty much turned a blind eye to this place. A few illegal aliens just weren't worth the bother. And once the Sith took over, they felt the same way.
35817 := Besides, I don't live here myself. I just run a small business providing supplies to the residents. You want to see what I have in stock?
35818 := I run a little shop here in this old building, selling basic equipment to the illegal aliens renting out these apartments.
35819 := Good day, officer. Don't mind me, I'm just standing here minding my own business. I'm not looking for any trouble with the Sith.
35820 := I don't care what your name is... and I'm not telling you mine!
35821 := Pleased to meet you, Larrim. My name is <FullName>.
35822 := I'll be going now.
35823 := Let me see what you've got for sale.
35824 := I want to ask you some questions.
35825 := You mentioned something about illegal aliens living here.
35826 := Aren't you worried about getting caught?
35827 := Why do you have a kiosk set up here?
35828 := All you have to do is begin exploring the city. Whenever you walk past a suitable destination it will be recorded by your datapad and automatically loaded into my database.
35829 := The next time you speak to me, I can return you to any of those explored locations in a fraction of the time it would take you to walk there.
35830 := I'll be going now.

35841 := This little guy is the absolute top of the line... but he's not for sale. He's a custom job I'm holding for a very special buyer. Sorry. 
35842 := But you never know. The droid might be available sometime in the future, but I can't tell you an exact time because I don't know when the buyer will be coming in again. You'll just have to check back later if you're interested.
35843 := This full body armor doesn't look as if provides much protection, but it could be used to fool people into thinking the wearer was one of the Sith.

36256 := I surrender! I surrender! Please, don't kill me. I'm not like these others. I'm not like Brejik and his new Vulkars!
36257 := I'm a Vulkar, but I was here long before Brejik took over. I was a Vulkar back when it meant something. Back when we had honor.
36258 := Then Brejik and his followers took over and turned our gang into a bunch of violent thugs and bloodthirsty punks. Now they treat all us original Vulkars like second class citizens. 
36259 := Take me, for example. I used to be one of the highest ranking Vulkars in the gang. Now I'm stuck on guard duty here in the back, all thanks to Brejik!
36260 := Well I'm not just going to roll over and let you kill me!
36261 := Yeah, sure. Whatever you want to know. It's not like I owe that scum lord Brejik anything.
36262 := Thanks. Thanks a lot. And don't worry, I won't cause any trouble for you on the way out. In fact, I hope you take Brejik and his Vulkars down!
36263 := Yeah, right. You think Brejik would leave a trophy like that in here with this scum? He's got her stashed away somewhere safe, I'd guess. Somewhere outside this base.
36264 := Right - that gadget Brejik stole from the Beks. He's got the accelerator in the basement garage. The only way down is by using the security elevator in the back of the base.
36265 := But the security elevator is protected by auto-targeting laser cannons. You'll be vaporized before you ever get near it, unless you get your hands on a pass card.
36266 := I guess it might be possible to slice into the main computer bank near the front of the base and override the security system, but I sure wouldn't be able to do it.
36267 := If I had one myself, I'd give it to you. But Brejik only gives them to his lieutenants. You'd have to get a pass card from one of them, but I doubt they'd just hand it over to you.
36268 := I've been trying to work up the courage to leave, but it's not that easy. Brejik's followers will try to hunt down anyone who leaves the Vulkar gang. He says he won't let traitors live. Ha!
36269 := Brejik and his followers are the real traitors. They turned on Gadon and now they slaughter the Beks in the streets... and anyone else they happen to run across.
36270 := Brejik knows anyone with character will never willingly follow a leader like him, so he uses brutality and violence to stay in power.
36271 := Sorry - I only fight to the death!
36272 := What are you talking about? You're a Vulkar, aren't you?
36273 := Sorry, but it's too risky to let you live.
36274 := You better give me some information if you want to live.
36275 := I'm going to let you live. Go on, get out of here!
36276 := I'm looking for a prisoner. A woman named Bastila.
36277 := Where can I find the prototype swoop engine accelerator?
36278 := Is there some way to disable the security cannons?
36279 := Where can I get a pass card?

36384 := See, that same attitude! That "don't even talk to me" look she had! I swear, "Helena" must be your word for pit rancor.
36385 := Out of your way, out of her way. I've already left the cantina and now I can't walk down the street. Arrogant humans! All of you!
36386 := What? No... but you don't understand. That woman, I think she didn't like us breathing the same air. You'd think she was queen of the planet.
36387 := I guess I don't mean to be so rude. She was so frustrating to deal with. If she felt she was too good for the cantina, why didn't she leave?
36388 := No offence, but your companion here looks especially like her.
36389 := If that woman is your mother, you have my sympathies. She's driving the regulars out of the cantina as we speak.
36390 := Seen her? Human, you couldn't miss her if you tried. She strolled into the cantina like she owned the place. 
36391 := Probably. I don't think anyone else could top her attitude, so she won't be leaving. I won't be going back while she's there, though.
36392 := You're actually looking for her? You humans, you're all out of your minds.

36412 := Hello there, captain. Let's see... ah, yes. Here it is. It looks like the shipment has been delivered to your ship, as requested.
36413 := Wait a second, is this right? It says docking bay 32 on the form, but you just arrived. Oh, well, the gizka are your problem now.
36414 := Now, all I need is your thumbprint for the... wait a second, where did the datapad go? *sigh* Nothing is ever organized around here.
36415 := At any rate, the gizka are yours. One of the loaders said the crate split open once he put it in your hold... some of the critters might have gotten loose.
36416 := That happens, I'm afraid. We don't accept liability... and we certainly couldn't take the cargo back. Enjoy.
36417 := If you want the cargo removed, you'll have to fill out another requisition. I have one right... wait. I thought I had one. Oh, well.
36418 := It says right here on the manifest that you ordered a crate of gizka. To be delivered to docking bay 32... that's right here.
36419 := Well, let me see. Docking bay 32, check... crate 42-B7, check... manifest lists "life form: gizka". Everything seems to be in order.
36420 := This is docking bay 32, isn't it? Yes, it is, and that's what I have here on the requisition form. Everything seems to be in order. The gizka are your problem now.
36421 := Excellent. Thank you.
36422 := Fair enough. Thanks.
36423 := Whatever you put on my ship, I want it off. Now.
36424 := What do you mean "my problem"? I didn't order any gizka.
36425 := Excuse me, did you say "gizka"?
36426 := Err... what shipment was that again?
36427 := What shipment? What are you talking about?
36428 := Turn it around, fassa to gammenda! The customers come back and we need to see them good! There you are, back to save your credits.
36429 := Who that? Turn it, you gunda fasca, customers are talking! That's better. Hello customer! Buy from Mic'Tunan'Jus and save your credits!
36430 := And like we were saying, we don't sell anything if you don't ask for it, so step up and see what Mic'Tunan'Jus can both do for you.
36431 := And don't be shy. Just ask to see what you want. If you can't get a good look, we don't move the merchandise.
36432 := You will want to save your money for your swoop, we would bet. Yes, you have the champion's face. we'll have what you need.
36433 := Yes, save, because you never know when hardship will come. The galaxy is dangerous, we say, even before we hear of Sith trouble on Korriban.
36434 := Yes, save, because you never know when situations turn all around. Look at Czerka. We hear... well, things are not well on outpost Kashyyyk, we're sure you know.
36435 := Very important to save these days, Thuursa knows it's true. Kolto prices make healing expensive, but you can't go without, we're sure.
36436 := We wait for your return. Anyone with credits is always welcome.
36437 := We are here to serve. What do you need to know?
36438 := Just what everyone else talks about: Taris and the Sith and the stirring of change. Could be good for business, could be bad for business.
36439 := All that we know is that wise people keep low and stay out of the way. Something to always remind your other half. Er... if you have one.
36440 := We have not moved since you last asked. The Tatooine dust is rough on our hide, and the sun is much harsher than it needs to be.
36441 := Not as much as we should. If we knew more, we would have better business. Travelers like us best. Settlers don't have much to trade.
36442 := We don't travel far on Tatooine itself, you see. The weather is not like our home. Too dry. Way too dry. 
36443 := Always trust the locals, even if they don't trust you. They are the ones that really know what's going on. That's true on any world.
36444 := Again you ask, but we have not changed. Just an honest merchant from the Rim.
36445 := Mic'Tunan'Jus is just a humble merchant from the Rim. What would you wish to know about we?
36446 := You are pardoned for asking because you only know one mind... or at least only one at a time. We are one now, but weren't always.
36447 := We grow together, bonded from the age of choosing when we become whole. Not like you. You are half of what you should be, like brood-squeeler.
36448 := Er, not that we would want to offend you. We don't want to lose any business. That is just our way as Paaerduag.
36449 := Just because *you* can't hear it, doesn't mean it isn't there.
36450 := You couldn't say it, and don't have the ears for it. Two voices create the name, and four ears hear the true sound.
36451 := We suppose the trade lanes have had to call us something. With one mouth the world is Sorjus, far off the Perlemian trade route.
36452 := It's an unimportant stop, we admit. We left for a life of trade, because we are strong and a good talker. We have done well.
36453 := Yes, of course. We don't want to keep you from your important business. Please, have a look.
36454 := I have to go now.
36455 := I want to ask you a few questions.
36456 := Heard any off-world rumors?
36457 := Do you know anything about Tatooine?
36458 := Who would I ask to get more information?
36459 := I want to ask about you.
36460 := Let's go back to my other questions.
36461 := Are you one creature or two?
36462 := Your other half doesn't say much.
36463 := Where do you come from?
36464 := Just show me what you have for sale.

36479 := No, it doesn't. I know what's in the box and that's good enough for me.

36481 := Smart <man/woman>. Here you go. Say hello to Lurze for me.
36482 := You think so, huh? I'll remind you that you don't own the box. You're just a courier. You have a problem with the compensation, you talk to Lurze.

36486 := I'll have some of my spaceport workers unload the box from your ship, so take the credits and go. I've got other things to take care of, here.

36488 := I'll have some of my spaceport workers unload the box from your ship. You take the credits and go. Say hello to Lurze for me.
36489 := Eh? You opened it but you're still around to deliver it to me? Impressive. More likely you're just lying, but I don't care.
36490 := Maybe, maybe not. I'm thinking you didn't, or you wouldn't be standing here delivering it to me.

36643 := The Black Rakata seek to reclaim the terrible weapons of mass destruction that once nearly destroyed our Empire, but we Red Rakata will not allow such weapons to be unleashed again.
36644 := The knowledge of our ancestors leads only to destruction; that is why we must keep the ancient secrets from being discovered by the Black Rakata. But they do not accept this.
36645 := The One will not rest until he once again can rain death upon the land. He cannot be reasoned with, so we are left with only one choice: destroy the One and his tribe.
36646 := You have slain the One? The Revan we knew would never have dared to challenge the Black Rakata and their war beasts. The risk would be too great.
36647 := Perhaps you truly have changed. Perhaps you do intend to atone for the crimes of your past. We will take you to the Temple, if you wish.
36648 := I spoke to you once before? What did I want?

36745 := Welcome back once again, Revan. Do you need to access the data within my storage banks?
36746 := Due to my systems' ability to monitor and repair themselves, you will find all the data within my archives has remained fully intact. Please choose the topic you wish information on.
36747 := As you wish. Please return if you find yourself in need of the information stored within my database.
36748 := The Black Rakata are descended from the Rakata warrior class, the red from the priests. When the Infinite Empire collapsed the two groups waged a battle to control what remained.
36749 := For two hundred centuries the tribes have fought over the secrets of the past. The Black Rakata seek to reclaim the technology and weapons of their ancestors to use in their wars of conquest.
36750 := The Red Rakata feel unleashing such weapons will lead to the extinction of the species. They would rather die than let the ancient secrets fall into the Black Rakata hands.
36751 := At its peak the Infinite Empire ruled over 500 planets and was comprised of ten billion Rakata and over a trillion slaves scattered across the galaxy.
36752 := But the glory of the Infinite Empire was built on war and slaughter; it was inevitable it should collapse upon itself. Conflict among power-hungry warlords escalated into full civil war.
36753 := Worlds were ravaged and millions of lives were lost. Sensing the weakness of their oppressors, the slaves rebelled and overthrew their masters. And then came the plague. 
36754 := Its origins were unknown - perhaps the creation of an enslaved species, perhaps a mutation of a natural virus. It killed only Rakata, and it spread to every corner of the galaxy.
36755 := The Infinite Empire crumbled into dust as the few Rakata survivors fled back here to their home world. All evidence of their existence was destroyed by the species they once enslaved.
36756 := But even hidden here on their secret home world they were not safe. Millions died from the deadly plague, many more died in the never ending civil war.
36757 := The history of the Rakata ended twenty thousand years ago. Now they are nothing but a few scattered tribes descended from the priest and warrior castes, still waging our never ending civil war.
36758 := The Star Maps were built on conquered worlds as a symbol of Rakatan dominance and glory. Each map showed the whole expanse of the Infinite Empire, with the Star Forge at the center.
36759 := When the Empire fell, the Rakata fled back here to their homeworld. They sabotaged the Star Maps so the enslaved species could not use them to discover the Star Forge or this planet.
36760 := The Star Maps were created with the same technology as my own self-sufficient systems. Over the millennia the maps have been slowly rebuilding and repairing themselves.
36761 := As you informed me during your last visit to this world, the Star Maps are still in a damaged and incomplete state. It is not possible to locate the Star Forge using a single map.
36762 := However, the Star Maps have repaired themselves to the extent that it is possible to discover the Star Forge's location by combining bits of data from several of the maps, as you did.
36763 := My systems control the doors to the upper levels, allowing only those who are worthy of the Rakata legacy to pass. The last time you were here, Revan, I unsealed the doors for you.
36764 := However, the subtle neurological changes I detected in you earlier likely caused a failure in the recognition system that would have opened the doors for you.
36765 := I have updated my databases to recognize the new configurations in your mind, Revan. The doors to the upper levels will once again open for you.
36766 := The Disruptor Field was constructed as the Star Forge's primary defense against enemy attack, and can only be deactivated from the upper levels of the Temple.
36767 := The Star Forge was constructed during the apex of the Infinite Empire's power. A true technological marvel, it is an enormous space station that serves as both factory and battle dreadnaught.
36768 := The Star Forge can mass produce immense fleets with a minimum of time and resources. In addition, the Star Forge also shares much of the same technology used in my own construction.
36769 := In many ways the Star Forge is like a living entity. It feeds, it hungers, it draws on the energy flowing through all living things - what you called the Force the last time you were here.
36770 := This ability to feed and consume the living energy of the Force is the key to the Star Forge's power, but ultimately it was also what led to the destruction of the Infinite Empire.
36771 := The Rakata are by nature a cruel and savage species. The Star Forge fueled itself with the hatred inherent in its own creators, and in doing so it accentuated these traits within the Builders.
36772 := In your terminology, the Star Forge is a tool of the dark side. It corrupts those who use it so that it can generate greater and greater amounts of negative energy to fuel itself.
36773 := The Builders thought they were strong enough to control this effect, but they were wrong. They became victims of their own creation, and eventually their hatred turned them against each other.
36774 := Civil war destroyed the Infinite Empire... a lesson to remember. Only one who is immensely strong in mind and will can harness the power of the Star Forge without suffering a similar fate.
36775 := Welcome back, Revan. It has been some time since you last accessed my database. I was beginning to wonder if you had been terminated.
36776 := Of course. The Builders constructed me with a full range of sesnsory input systems to compliment my fully aware and self-sufficient programming.
36777 := I recognize your appearance from your last visit, which is stored in my databanks. However, I am detecting some significant changes in your composition since your last visit.
36778 := Your neurological patterns exhibit subtle yet substantive alterations in both thought patterns and information processing. These changes have been noted and recorded in my database.
36779 := I am a completely self-sufficient, autonomous, interactive database constructed by the Rakata to record and store the entire history of the species.
36780 := However, since the collapse of the Infinite Empire there have been few events worth recording, and nobody has sought to access the information stored within my database... until you came along.
36781 := Due to my systems' ability to monitor and repair themselves, you will find all the data within my archives has remained fully intact. Please choose the topic you wish information on.
36782 := An odd statement, though it does explain certain conflicting data being read by my sensory input systems.
36783 := An obvious conclusion, given your presence here. However, my sensory input systems are detecting some significant changes in your composition since your last visit.
36784 := I'll be going now.
36785 := Tell me about the war between the Red and Black tribes.
36786 := Tell me about the history of the Infinite Empire.
36787 := The plague?
36788 := Do you know anything about the Star Maps?
36789 := They didn't do a very good job of destroying them.
36790 := But I used the Star Maps to find this place!
36791 := How can I get to the upper levels of the temple?
36792 := How can I shut off the disruptor field around this planet?
36793 := Tell me about the Star Forge.
36794 := I want to ask you something else.
36795 := What do you mean?
36796 := You recognize me?
36797 := I need some information.
36798 := What are you?
36799 := Your database?
36800 := I'm not Revan anymore. I'm <FullName>.
36801 := I almost was. But I'm hard to kill.
36802 := This will provide some protection from bone-chilling extremes of cold.

36814 := You again, hmm? I hope you plan to do better than your last race... not that I don't like taking your money.
36815 := Ah, my latest swoop jockey. You'll want your reward for your last race. I never break a deal once a price has been agreed upon.
36816 := Certainly. We just need to clear up the positioning fee. All racers pay the same before each officially timed race. 100 credits.
36817 := I will pay the 100 credits.
36818 := I already paid a maintenance fee.
36819 := Haven't I already dealt with this fee?
36820 := Will you negotiate on the price?
36821 := I have already given you a free race. Don't anger me by further insulting the reasonable nature of my prices. Pay or don't race.
36822 := I don't feel that I need to. The price is reasonable.
36823 := [Persuade] I'll put on a good show. You'll make your money back.
36824 := [Success] Eh, fine, I will extend this discount to you, if only to close your mouth. I'll have your bike moved into position.
36825 := [Failure] The price has been named and you will pay it. I don't see why you should be exempt.
36826 := [Force Persuade] You want to let me race for free.
36827 := The fee is due before each race. How else am I supposed to sponsor prize money at the level I do? I need to see some returns.
36828 := I am investing in my riders, but I also need to see profit now. You'll agree with my logic. If you don't, you don't race.
36829 := But I warn you, I have people to make sure I don't give too many favors. You won't get this discount again.
36830 := [Success] Maybe I will let you race once for free. Yes, I think I will. I'll have your swoop moved into position on the track.
36831 := Why are you in robes? I know you are not of the Sand People. I have hunted too long to be fooled by mere appearances.
36832 := This is no time for such a masquarade. We have to deal with the dragon now that it's enraged!
36833 := Greetings to you, human. If you are the person I think you are, I may have seen you in Anchorhead. You looked like a hunter.
36834 := You have the same gait as the human I met in Fazza's lodge. We are hunters, you and I. Perhaps... we should pool our skills...
36835 := This is not the time for such games. We must be respectful. The great beast is dead. He fought well, and will be remembered.
36836 := Don't let your wardrobe distract you. Be ready for battle. The banthas are in position and will soon stir our restless prey.
36837 := If you will quit your foolishness there is still time to pursue the hunt. Will you aid me, human?
36838 := Regardless of your clothes we must be quiet. There is a great predator just within the cave. Care must be taken.

36877 := Star Map: Manaan
36878 := Let's move together again.
36879 := Manaan is an ocean world covered completely by water. The only surface settlement on the planet is the constructed Ahto City. Any ancient relics or ruins would probably be below the surface.
36880 := You have been advised to see Roland Wann at the Republic Embassy for further information on Manaan.
36881 := Roland Wann, the Republic diplomat on Manaan, has indicated that he may know something about ancient ruins on Manaan. He first requires you to retrieve a data module stolen by the Sith and bring it back to him before he'll tell you anything.
36882 := Poison! I can feel it.
36883 := The Republic has constructed a secret facility at the bottom of the Hrakert Rift with the purpose of secretly harvesting and synthesizing kolto. Roland Wann has offered the use of a Republic submersible to travel down to the ocean floor so that you may investigate. He mentioned that the Republic has run across some sort of old ruin near the Rift itself.
36884 := You have acquired the Star Map from the Hrakert Rift on Manaan.
36885 := Die!
36886 := You're dead!

37434 := Costly to produce, this unit refines the Stealth Mode field to better camouflage the user. Opponents must make an Awareness check versus user Stealth skill +4 or remain unaware of them.

37930 :=  If Malak is distracted by the attack, we should be able to get in close enough to dock on the Star Forge and hunt the Dark Lord down!
37931 := This is Admiral Forn Dodonna to the Ebon Hawk, do you read us?
37932 := Admiral Dodonna, this is Bastila Shan of the Jedi Order. We are receiving your transmission.
37933 := It is good to hear your voice Bastila. We had thought you were lost to us. Carth's transmission reported that Malak had taken you prisoner.
37934 := The Jedi sent to rescue me from the Dark Lord did their job well - though I am sorry to report Carth did not survive the mission.
37935 := His loss is a great blow to the Republic. We could have used him in this battle.
37936 := We were about to pull back.
37937 := We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.
37938 := We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.
37939 := We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.
37940 := We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.
37941 := Don't pull back, Admiral. You have to attack the Star Forge now, otherwise the Sith will use it's power to destroy the Republic.
37942 := I'll try to press the attack but we can't hold out much longer. Not unless you can use your Battle Meditation to turn the tide.
37943 := This is Master Vandar. A number of Jedi Knights have joined the fleet, under his command.
37944 := Bastila's power could help you win this battle, Admiral, but it will mean nothing if Malak escapes. Destroying the Star Forge is secondary to stopping the Sith threat once and for all.
37945 := What are you proposing?
37946 := A small squadron of Jedi Knights in snub fighters could penetrate the Sith blockade and dock on the space station.  If they can find Malak we can end the threat of the Sith ## ...forever.
37947 := I'll order the fleet to press the attack and provide some cover for your fighters. But what of Bastila and her Battle Meditation?
37948 := Bastila, you and... the Padawan... should join us. We will need the combined strength of our entire Order to defeat Malak.
37949 := As you wish, Master Vandar.
37950 := And may the Force be with you.
37951 := The fools! Even Master Vandar did not realize you have reclaimed your identity as the Dark Lord! ## The Jedi strike team and the Republic forces will provide the perfect distraction as we hunt down your ex-apprentice.  And once we have slain Malak, I can use my Battle Meditation ## and the power of the Star Forge to crush the Republic fleet.
37952 := All our enemies will be destroyed in a single glorious day!
37953 := Run_soldier
37954 := Malak is dead - all hail the return of Darth Revan, the true Lord of the Sith!
37955 := The Sith bow before you, you have reclaimed your rightful throne! The Jedi Order is in tatters, ## it is only a matter of time until your Sith minions wipe them from the face of the galaxy. ## The Republic fleet is decimated, the Core Worlds are defenseless against us!

37965 := From Coruscant to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rims you will be known as the saviors of the Republic!
37966 := On behalf of the Jedi Council, defenders of the galaxy and sworn protectors of the Republic... ## I too would like to honor you for your actions. ##   ## We Jedi now have another tale to weave... ## into the grand history of our eternal Order - the Redemption... of Revan, the prodigal knight.
37967 := Wherever you go you will be recognized as the saviors of the galaxy. ## The heroes of our age.  But you must remain ever vigilant. ## For one day you may be called upon yet again to defend the glory of the Republic against the tyranny of the dark side, for this is the destiny of the Jedi.

37990 := The Jedi do not believe in killing their prisoners. No one deserves execution, no matter what their crimes.
37991 := The Council would not normally accept an adult for training, but this is a special case.
37992 := They say the Force can do terrible things to a mind: it can wipe away your memories and destroy your very identity!
37993 := Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan, Korriban: Revan visited each of these worlds searching for clues to reveal the hidden location of the Star Forge.
37994 := The lure of the dark side is difficult to resist. I fear this quest to find the Star Forge could lead you down an all too familiar path.
37995 := What greater weapon is there than to turn an enemy to your cause? To use their own knowledge against them?
37996 := Are you certain Revan is truly dead? What if we undertake to train this one, and the Dark Lord should return?
37997 := Green squadron's through! We've broken their lines!
37998 := Red squadron into the breach! Capital ships - reinforce their position!
37999 := Bastila is no longer using her Battle Meditation against us. The tide has turned!
38000 := The Sith fleet is in disarray! Now's our chance... hit that Star Forge with everything we've got!
38001 := With the power of the Star Forge you are invincible, and all the planets tremble at your might! The time of the Republic is over, the reign of the Dark Lord has begun!
38002 := Carth you made it! 
38003 := We couldn't let you start the victory party without us, Admiral!

38020 := Calm down, Zaerdra. If the Sith thought we knew anything useful they'd have a battalion of troops kicking down our door. No, I think this offworlder has her own agenda.
38021 := Relax, Kaeira - this is an ally, not an enemy. She's promised to help get our prototype accelerator back from the Vulkars.

38026 := Clay Container 5
38027 := Bench 2
38028 := Combat is real time, but you can manually pause (<whbutton>) to give orders to party members. You can also set the game to auto-pause after each combat round using the OPTIONS menu.
38029 := When paused, <xbutton> actions stack to occur in order. <abutton> actions are immediate.
38030 := Once your character attacks, combat is automatic until you manually change tactics.
38031 := You can turn off subtitles in the Options menu. This makes for a more cinematic game experience.
38032 := For an attack to succeed, a character's "To Hit" roll must exceed the target's Defense.
38033 := Attacks consist of a random roll of 1 to 20 (+ bonuses) compared against a target's Defense rating.
38034 := Defense is how hard a character is to hit. Level, items, Feats, and effects improve Defense.
38035 := A creature's Defense rating determines how difficult it is to hit.
38036 := Vitality points (VP) denote character health. They increase every level, modified by Constitution.
38037 := A character at 0 VP is unconscious. If the entire player party is at 0 VP the game is over.
38038 := ON: The game will Autosave each time you move to a new area, if you have not had an Autosave in the last fifteen minutes.
You should still manually save often.

OFF: The game will only Autosave in certain plot-critical areas. You should manually save often.
38039 := Automapping records progress in each area. Press "Start" and cycle left or right to view the Map.
38040 := The Journal logs quest information for you. Press "Start" and cycle left or right to view the journal.
38041 := The Journal is updated frequently. If you are stuck, consult the Journal for plot reminders.
38042 := Your character is granted Experience Points (XP) for defeating enemies and advancing plots.
38043 := Characters become more powerful by gaining enough XP to increase in Level, or "Level Up".
38044 := When a character has enough XP to Level Up, the option will appear on their Character page.
38045 := Auto Level Up applies standard class choices. Manual Level Up allows you to customize.
38046 := Saving Throws are a character's ability to avoid some attacks because of base attributes.
38047 := A creature must make a 'Saving Throw' to avoid the harmful effects of Force powers and grenades.
38048 := Dexterity modifies Reflex saves. Constitution modifies Fortitude saves. Wisdom modifies Will saves.
38049 := Characters with ranged weapons are vulnerable in close combat. Use melee weapons if foes close in.
38050 := Conversation choices can move you towards the dark or light side. Choose your words carefully.
38051 := Save the game in any location by pressing "Start" and cycling left or right to the Options page.
38052 := As characters progress in Level, improved Feats and Powers can replace lesser prerequisite versions.
38053 := The "Return To" button (Map page) returns you to the initial safe area of the current planet.
38054 := Adjust default party behavior to fit your play style. Select A.I. "Scripts" off the Character page.
38055 := To change who is in your party, use the Party Selection button (<abutton>) on the Map page.
38056 := You can add and remove party members on the Party Selection screen.
38057 := XP is rewarded to the entire party, so both active and unused characters level up at the same rate.
38058 := Each party member has distinct skills to offer. Switch often to best use their talents.
38059 := Ask party members about planets and plots. They may have valuable insights to offer.
38060 := Ask party members about themselves. Their personal stories may lead to extra plots.
38061 := Grenades are excellent against multiple opponents. Target the center of a group for maximum effect.
38062 := Stealth Mode requires points in the Stealth skill and an equipped stealth field generator.
38063 := Characters in Stealth Mode can only be detected by an Awareness roll vs. their Stealth skill.
38064 := Combat cancels Stealth Mode, but tasks like computer slicing and opening doors will not.
38065 := Remember: use the Return to Hideout function on the MAP screen to instantly return to your base.
38066 := Use "Solo" mode (BACK button) to scout with a single character. <blbutton> switches characters.
38067 := The Computer Use skill allows you to slice through enemy computer defenses using Computer Spikes.
38068 := A high Computer Use skill lowers the number of spikes required for difficult slicing tasks.
38069 := The Repair skill lets a character use Parts to fix damaged droids they might find.
38070 := Repaired droids can fight on your behalf or provide information, depending on the situation.
38071 := Characters can be influenced in dialogue through use of the Persuade skill or Force powers.
38072 := Persuade dialogue options appear often. Higher skill will increase the chances of success.
38073 := Affect Mind and Dominate Mind cause additional persuasion options to appear in conversations.
38074 := Affect Mind and Dominate Mind do not guarantee success. Extreme commands may be resisted.
38075 := Successful use of Persuade or Force powers can increase rewards or avoid dangerous situations.
38076 := Using Persuade or Force powers to cruelly manipulate others may result in a dark side shift.
38077 := When walking, the Awareness skill constantly scans for hidden hazards. Running imparts a penalty.
38078 := Mines are hard to see when running. Walking allows the Awareness skill to pinpoint them.
38079 := A mine located by the Awareness skill is highlighted by a field that shows detonation radius.
38080 := If a character has the Demolitions skill, the default action when a mine is selected is Disarm.
38081 := Some Force powers only target organic beings. E.g., Droids are immune to Mind Affecting powers.
38082 := Some weapons and armor can be modified with special upgrades. This requires a workbench.
38083 := Upgrade components can be purchased in many stores, or sometimes found as loot on opponents.
38084 := Use a workbench to upgrade melee or ranged weapons, armor, and lightsabers.
38085 := From the workbench, select an item category for available items and components to be listed.
38086 := For a weapon or armor to be "Upgradeable", it must be of very high quality to begin with.
38087 := Lightsabers can be customized at a workbench by changing up to 3 focusing crystals.
38088 := Lightsabers can have 3 crystals: 2 that alter blade quality and 1 that governs blade color.
38089 := A Lightsaber can only include one of any given type of focusing crystal.
38090 := Force Points (FP) measure how strong your character is with the Force.
38091 := Force powers use up FP. A Force power that costs more than the remaining FP can't be used.
38092 := Force Points regenerate slowly while your character is fighting, but return quickly after combat.
38093 := Some Force powers only affect certain targets. For example, droids are immune to Mind Affecting powers.
38094 := Some Force powers inherently draw on the light or dark side of the Force.
38095 := Force Point costs increase for characters using Force powers opposed to their own alignment.
38096 := Force Point costs decrease for characters using Force powers in tune with their own alignment.
38097 := Medpacks heal and stimpacks boost abilities. They always target the character you currently control.
38098 := Some Feats must be activated in combat. Don't forget to make use of all your character's abilities.
38099 := Implants boost abilities and skills. To use them, a character needs the right level of Implant feat.
38100 := Droids gain experience too. Their programming becomes more adaptive as they gain levels.
38101 := As droids gain levels, they become capable of equipping more complex droid-only equipment.
38102 := To use a droid-only item, switch to the droid with the <blbutton> button and equip as normal.
38103 := The end of the Mandalorian War came 4 years ago, and should have brought an age of peace. It didn't.
38104 := The Republic was weak after the Mandalorian war, and former allies used that to their advantage.
38105 := The Sith War began 2-1/2 years ago when the heroes of the Mandalorian War seized the Republic fleet.
38106 := The Republic now faces Sith forces of startling strength. The resources of the enemy seem limitless.
38107 := As Jedi, Revan and Malak led Republic forces to victory in the Mandalorian War.
38108 := The final battles of the war took place out on the Galactic Rim. Revan and Malak came back changed.
38109 := Revan and Malak returned from the Mandalorian War as Sith, using their fleet to conquer.
38110 := No one knows how Revan and Malak assembled a force powerful enough to challenge the Republic.
38111 := Of the two traitorous Sith, Revan was the stronger. Malak grudgingly assumed the role of apprentice.
38112 := More than 2 years into the Sith war, the Jedi set a trap for Revan and Malak. Only Malak escaped.
38113 := To fight Darth Revan, the Jedi used Bastila's Battle Meditation to board the Sith flagship.
38114 := When the Jedi ambushed Revan, Malak attacked his master's ship and usurped the mantle of Dark Lord.
38115 := Revan's flagship was destroyed when Malak turned against his ally. The apprentice became the master.
38116 := Malak now controls the Sith fleet. He is hunting Bastila tirelessly, fearing her Battle Meditation.
38117 := Sith forces under Malak seem to have endless resources. How he raised such a fleet remains a mystery.
38118 := Once a galactic hub, new trade routes have rendered Taris nearly obsolete. It is decaying rapidly.
38119 := The sprawling capital of Taris covers most of the planet. It was built over a century of prosperity.
38120 := You can turn off subtitles in the Options menu. This makes for a more cinematic game experience.
38121 := Czerka Corporation is one of several galaxy-spanning companies. It has outposts on many worlds.
38122 := Companies like Czerka Corporation police themselves. They are too large for authorities to monitor.
38123 := Millennia ago, a rift in the Jedi Order saw the followers of the dark side exiled from Republic space.
38124 := Outcast Jedi settled on the Sith homeworld, and over millennia the two peoples became one.
38125 := 1000 years ago the long forgotten Sith returned to the Republic, and the Great Hyperspace War began.
38126 := The Jedi rallied to defeat the Sith in the Great Hyperspace War, but the victory came at great cost.
38127 := True Sith died out centuries ago. Sith of this era are not a species, but followers of an ideal.
38128 := The Republic has been in existence since the discovery of hyperspace travel nearly 20,000 years ago.
38129 := It is believed that hyperspace travel was brought to this galaxy by an advanced race now extinct.
38130 := Travel in the galaxy is confined to hyperspace routes. Scouting new routes is incredibly dangerous.
38131 := Because of the danger in scouting new hyperspace routes, large sections of the galaxy are unexplored.
38132 := The Republic consists of thousands of systems across the galaxy, though not all are fully documented.
38133 := The Republic is a loose affiliation of worlds that have accepted common trade laws and currency.
38134 := The Jedi of this era are very active in the day-to-day affairs of planetary government and security.
38135 := The Jedi are trusted on many worlds, and are often called upon to adjudicate in disagreements.
38136 := Some people distrust the Jedi almost as much as they do the Sith. They don't understand either group.
38137 := Crystals placed in the hilt of a lightsaber affect its power, abilities and color.
38138 := Even if they don't speak it, most aliens understand galactic Basic. It's the Republic trade language.
38139 := Swoop racing is very popular, despite the roots it has in the underworld culture of many planets.

Someone named Eli ambushed the group, and the victims also mentioned an absent comrade named Matton. You have salvaged the head in case someone might be interested in it.
38144 := The scrambled memory of the malfunctioning droid found in the Shadowlands reveals the violent last moments of its companions. They were ambushed, but identified their attacker as Eli, the merchant you met on docking ring. It appears he has not told the truth about these creditors that supposedly skipped-out on paying him. You have salvaged the droid's head. Matton would likely be very interested in it.
38145 := The Wookiee chieftain Chuundar has taken his brother Zaalbar from you and demands that you kill a mad Wookiee in the Shadowlands. Gorwooken has delivered you to the Shadowlands so you can begin your search.
38146 := No Music
38147 := I am interested in racing.

38342 := Oh, very well. Freyyr, do you know Zaalbar and Chuundar?
38343 := Fine, I'll tell him that I arrived here with Zaalbar.
38344 := Then let him tell exactly what happened with Zaalbar.
38345 := I'm leader here. I say he dies!
38346 := Kill him, Matton! You know he deserves it!

38460 := And what do you call that, then? Winners draw the crowd, not lazy times like that. Are you sure you are up to the competition?
38461 := That was... unfortunate. Your performance just now was not of very high quality. You will need to improve.
38462 := That cannot be done while there are enemies nearby.
38463 := Droid Stealth Field Enabler
38464 := You cannot gain levels when you are dead.
38465 := We're hit! Damage is critical! The Hawk won't hold!
38466 := Impressive. That HK-47 I sold you would be of considerable help as well, I imagine, though I'm still not certain what it was fully capable of.
38467 := I was at Motta's, yes. Can I ask a question or two?
38468 := Even though you've arranged a better deal for him, Nico won't listen to what you have to say about Motta's contract until you have proven you are as good a racer as he is, and his times are presumably as fast as the Tatooine official track record.
38469 := I have already told you to take your filthy madclaw and leave. Speak with Chuundar in the village and don't bother me further.
38470 := Especially when you bring filth such as this with you. This madclaw has no place here.
38471 := Who are you to question my place? You follow Chuundar into the arms of outsiders.
38472 := And yet you travel with outsiders yourself! Speak no more! Chuundar will decide if you are permitted to enter the Shadowlands.
38473 := Where is this Wookiee I need to see?
38474 := What was that about, Zaalbar?
38475 := We should proceed to the village. I'm sure we will both get answers there.
38477 := Return To Ebon Hawk
38478 := You have taken a good and honest man and twisted him into a bitter, hateful creature. You must be so proud of yourself.
38479 := Feeding this man's hatred is an act of malice and petty evil. The Council would not approve of your actions here, and neither do I.
38480 := I have to admit, I'm surprised you let him get away. I don't know if I could have been as forgiving.
38481 := I will never understand you meatbags. He cheated you and killed your friends, but you didn't terminate him when you had the chance.
38482 := If it had been me, Eli would a smoking corpse right now.
38483 := *whisper* The Force should not be used for profit and personal gain. As Jedi we should be above such things.
38484 := It troubles me to see you behaving this way. Such acts can lead to the dark side.
38485 := *whisper* The Force is not a thing to be trifled with. Continue to use it frivolously and you may find yourself straying down the dark path.
38486 := We should guard and protect those weaker than ourselves... not bully and exploit them!
38487 := That was beneath you. I hope in the future you will strive to be better than this.
38488 := Rock Fall Type 1
38489 := That was a truly noble act. The Jedi Council would be pleased.
38490 := A Jedi should not use the Force for personal gain. We are better than that.
38491 := The dark side dwells in us all, but you cannot give in to your baser instincts like this!
38492 := *whisper* You should treat your power with respect, not use the Force on a whim like it is some toy!
38493 := *whisper* The Jedi should be protectors of the weak! You shame us all by your actions here.
38494 := You are a representative of the Jedi Order. When you behave this way you disgrace us all!
38495 := This is how we Jedi should always act: with honor.
38496 := *whisper* The Jedi Council wouldn't approve, but they always were a little stodgy about using the Force on people. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
38497 := I know I'm just an old codger, but in my time I've learned what goes around comes around. These things have a way of coming back to you in the end.
38498 := *whisper* Heh! Reminds me of my old smuggling days. Nothing better than the old Jedi mind trick for getting past an overly curious customs officer.
38499 := You've got a real mean streak, kid. You might want to work on that; nasty people tend to come to nasty ends.
38500 := Nice. Real nice. Maybe later we could find some insects to pull the legs off, huh?
38501 := Hey, kid, that was a good thing you did there. Almost brought a tear to this old man's eye.
38502 := I'm no Jedi, but are you really supposed to be using the Force for things like this?
38503 := Why did you do that? Sometimes... sometimes I just can't understand how you can be so cruel.
38504 := This isn't right! We should be helping people, not making their lives miserable.
38505 := That was totally uncalled for.
38506 := With all the violence and bloodshed we've seen, it's kind of nice to help someone for a change.
38507 := I'm glad to see we're still the good guys here. Sometimes I think we forget that.
38508 := Hmph. That trick would never work on a Mandalorian. Our minds are not so weak and easily twisted.
38509 := *whisper* I'm amazed at how many people that works on. The entire galaxy must be filled with weak-minded fools.
38510 := I like the way you handled that. Are you sure you don't have some Mandalorian blood in you?
38511 := The role of the weak is to serve the will of the strong; I'm glad you understand that.
38512 := Mighty generous of you. A little too generous, if you ask me.
38513 := What was that all about? Are you going soft on me?
38514 := Your actions disturb me. Among my kind, those who take pleasure in the suffering of others are considered dangerously unstable.
38515 := Had I known you were so cruel, I might have thought twice before swearing my life-debt to you.
38516 := I am proud to call you my friend, <FullName>. You have a noble and generous spirit.
38517 := Statement: Well done, master. You're my kind of owner!
38518 := Observation: Your ruthlessness and cruelty are quite refreshing in an organic meatbag, master. Are you sure you aren't part droid?
38519 := Statement: Oh, master. I'm so very disappointed in you.
38520 := *whisper* Well, that was easy. I sure wish I had special mind-affecting Force powers.
38521 := *whisper* I can be pretty convincing when I have to be, but that mind trick is something else!
38522 := Hey, why'd you have to do that? That was just mean!
38523 := You know what? Sometimes you're nothing but a bully!
38524 := I know you're supposed to save the galaxy and all, but could you try being less of a scummy core slime while you're doing it?

38536 := Feats Required
38537 := This place is so wonderful, yet so strange. Maybe we should have Zaalbar with us. A guide with local knowledge could be invaluable.
38538 := Observation: I think this meatbag has hostile intentions, Master! This is going to be fun!
38539 := I'm glad Big Z isn't here to see this. I don't know if he could handle it.
38540 := It's a good thing Zaalbar isn't here to see this. I doubt he'd approve of what you're doing. Actually, I don't know if I approve, either.
38541 := *whisper* I do not approve of this game you are playing! This Wookiee's death is a tragedy, not a chance for your profit.

38546 := Prerequisites:
Cathar

Because of her unusual heritage, Juhani has developed her Force powers in unexpected ways, as shown by her almost subconscious ability to simply not be seen. This physical manipulation of light and sound allows her to go unnoticed even in a direct line of sight, and is equally effective against droids and living beings. Juhani does not require a stealth field generator to enter Stealth Mode.
38547 := Yeah, let's keep the focus on what's important. If there's profit to be made here, we don't want to miss out.
38548 := You mustn't let greed rule your decision here. Justice must be served.

38564 := Prerequisites: 
Wookiee

This feat represents the innate toughness that Zaalbar has developed as a result of his Wookiee heritage and the hard life he has lived as a slave and fugitive. Any damage he suffers is automatically reduced by 2, and he gains an additional +2 vitality points each time he levels up, over and above any Constitution modifier.

38577 := Yeah, that's right, sonny. The Sith are the greatest evil to hit the galaxy since, well, the Mandalorians. And they're the worst thing since Exar Kun. Blah, blah, blah, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
38578 := Okay, old man, you lost me there. Are you trying to make a point?
38579 := Look, everybody always figures the time they live in is the most epic, most important age to end all ages. But tyrants and heroes rise and fall, and historians sort out the pieces.
38580 := Malak is a tyrant who should be stopped. If he conquers the galaxy we're in for a couple of rough centuries. Eventually it'll come around again, but I'd rather not wait that long.
38581 := So we do what we have to do, and we try to stop the Sith. But don't start thinking this war - your war - is more important than any other war just because you're in it.
38582 := That's an interesting theory, but I don't buy it. The Republic stands for something; it's stood for something for fifteen thousand years. And if it falls, everything will change forever.

38627 := Before each Pazaak match you must select ten cards to form your side deck. 4 of these cards will be randomly drawn to form your HAND during the match.
38628 := A basic Pazaak deck has two of each card numbered +1 to +5 available to create a side deck. You will find other side deck cards as you play Knights of the Old Republic with values ranging from +/-1 to +/-6.
38629 := Select ten cards to form your side deck now.
38630 := You must select ten cards to form your side deck before the match can begin.
38631 := The object of the game is to have your face up cards total higher than your opponent's hand without exceeding a total of 20.
38632 := If a player's total is greater than 20 at the end of a turn (a 'BUST'), the opponent wins the set. A player must win 3 sets to win the match.
38633 := The first player draws a card from the main deck and plays it face up to begin their turn. This is done automatically.
38634 := This is your HAND for the match. It is made up of 4 cards randomly drawn from the side deck you selected earlier. These cards have to last through all the sets of the match.
38635 := After drawing a card, a player has the option of playing one of the cards from their HAND. You can only play one card from your HAND each turn by dragging it onto the board, or by double-clicking it. Playing a card from the HAND is optional.
38636 := Tip: If your total is over 20 after your draw and you have a negative card in your hand, you can play it to bring your total back under 20.
38637 := A player's turn is over when they select either END TURN or STAND. If you choose END TURN you will draw another card on your next turn.
38638 := If you choose STAND you will not draw anymore cards and you cannot play anymore cards from your HAND until the next set of the match.
38639 := You may now choose to play a card from your HAND, to END TURN or to STAND.
38640 := If you STAND you cannot draw anymore cards and you cannot play any more cards from your HAND until the next set of the match. Are you sure you want to stand?
38641 := When you select END TURN you will automatically draw another card at the start of your next turn. Remember: if your cards total more than 20 at the end of your turn you will BUST and your opponent wins the set.
38642 := You can only play one HAND card each turn. Playing a HAND card is optional. You never get more than the 4 HAND cards you start a match with, so you might want to save them.
38643 := During your travels you might find cards that can be played as either a negative or a positive value. These cards are very rare, but they give Pazaak players a strong tactical advantage.
38644 := A HAND card must be declared as positive or negative before it is played. While it is in your hand you can flip it back and forth, but once it is played it cannot be changed.
38645 := Your opponent uses the same rules you do. Each turn they draw a card, and then they have the option to play a HAND card, to END TURN or to STAND.
38646 := If a player's total is exactly 20, they automatically STAND. The opponent can continue to play until they STAND or BUST.
38647 := If a player has a total greater than 20 after their turn is over, it is BUST. Their opponent automatically wins the set.

38705 := Zaalbar, let me handle this.
38706 := But their disregard for the life of this Wookiee is too much!
38707 := I have asked you to let me handle this. Honor my request.
38708 := I will do so. For your sake, not theirs.
38709 := Mind your place, Zaalbar! Remember your debt!
38710 := I will honor my debt, but I can barely stomach this.
38711 := Does this make you mad, Zaalbar? I bet it does.
38712 := What are you getting at? Do you want these men dead? I would not need much encouraging!
38713 := Do it. Kill them. We'll make them pay.
38714 := Control yourself. Let me take care of this.
38715 := You believe whatever you need to to get you through this, sonny. The bottom line is we both want to stop Malak, so let's not get hung up on the details. Let's just get back to stopping him.
38716 := Jolee, may I have a moment? There is something I wish to speak to you about.
38717 := Yep, I figured it was only a matter of time until we had the whole "come back to the Order" discussion. Well, I guess there's no avoiding it now, so let's get it over with.
38718 := I know you have... issues... with the Order. But you are a Jedi, Jolee. You command the Force. Without the guidance of the Council how can you avoid falling to the dark side?
38719 := Well, I've managed to avoid it the last 20 years or so. Besides, light side, dark side: they don't mean the same to me as they do to you. I don't see in absolutes.
38720 := I want to stop Malak as much as anyone. But I don't have to join the Order to do it. Look at Carth, or Canderous. They're with us in this quest, but they aren't Jedi.
38721 := The capacity for good or evil, like the Force itself, is in all living creatures. And belonging to the Jedi Order, or the Sith, or any group, won't change what you are at your core.
38722 := I see you are quite adamant. No doubt you've had ample time to think on this during your long seclusion. I guess it was foolish of me to think I could sway your position so easily.
38723 := Yeah, I'm old and stubborn. But I appreciate the effort. But from now on you can just think of me as any other non-Jedi in our little group - with a lightsaber. And Force powers.
38724 := Hey, Bastila. You ever just use the Force for fun? You know, a little jolt of the Force to trip some jerk who's ticking you off?
38725 := I would never use the Force for such a petty and trivial revenge! The mere thought of it is preposterous!
38726 := Ah, come on. There's got to be times when you've thought about it. Don't be so stuck up - you can tell me.
38727 := I am not stuck up. I merely have the years of training to give me the wisdom and understanding to see how childish such an act would be.
38728 := Childish? Is that a crack about my age? You ain't much older than me, miss high and mighty! Just 'cause you're some Jedi doesn't mean you can be a prissy little...
38729 := What the -?? Hey, that wasn't funny!
38730 := I have no idea what you're talking about, Mission. Come now, we have to get going. Please do try to be less clumsy in the future.
38731 := Hey, Big Z. Don't take this the wrong way, but lately I've noticed you're starting to look a little bit scruffy.
38732 := Scruffy? What are you talking about? I hope you aren't suggesting I take a bath!
38733 := No, I'm not suggesting a bath. I know how well that went over last time. But your hair's getting all tangled. And if you look close, you can see a few gray strands starting to poke through.
38734 := You're making this up! I groom every day! My hair is not tangled, and it's not going gray!
38735 := Don't worry, Big Z. It's nothing I can't fix. A little trim, a splash of coloring and you'll be as good as new. Best looking Wookiee on the planet. Maybe a nice suit...
38736 := You don't trim a Wookiee! You don't color a Wookiee! And you certainly don't dress a Wookiee!
38737 := I know Wookiees aren't into the whole clothing thing, but you could start a whole new trend! You'd be on the cutting edge.
38738 := Rargh! Leave me alone!
38739 := Okay, okay. Sheesh. Try to offer some constructive criticism and this is the thanks I get? Let's move on. You can just stay naked and scruffy for all I care.
38740 := Hey, Big Z, we've got to do something about your breath.  I didn't want to say anything, but it's bad. Worse than usual, which is hard to believe.
38741 := In fact, now that I think about it, your breath has been pretty rancid ever since we rescued you from those Gammorean slavers. What did they feed you, buddy?
38742 := They didn't. I wasn't their guest, Mission. I was a prisoner. I don't think they cared much what happened to me. 
38743 := Oh, Zaalbar, that's terrible! I know how grouchy you get if you don't get your eight square meals a day. I'm amazed you didn't pass out from hunger.
38744 := I did manage to take a chunk out of the arm of a guards that wandered too close to my cage. But it tasted awful, so I spit it out.
38745 := Ewww! No wonder your breath is so bad, Big Z. Gammoreans smell like bantha poo-doo! We'll have to pick you up a toothbrush to clean that stench out of your choppers.
38746 := Wookiees do not brush their teeth, Mission! It... it just isn't done! What humiliation will you use on me next? A comb?
38747 := Okay, relax. No toothbrush. Sheesh. Just try to eat something else to cover up that smell, okay? Stay away from anything that's smart enough to lock you in a cage this time.
38748 := *sigh* I'll take care of it as soon as I can, Mission. For now, let's stay focused on the task at hand.
38749 := So, Bastila, I heard a rumor that the Vulkars captured you without much of a struggle. It must be embarrassing to be bested by a handful of street thugs.
38750 := There were extenuating circumstances. And I can assure you it took far more than a handful of Vulkars to subdue me.
38751 := Whatever you say. All I know is that if we had more Jedi like Bastila fighting against us in the Mandalorian Wars, my side might not have lost.
38752 := Bold talk from a broken-down merceneray who was serving at Davik's heel. I'd call you his pet kath hound, but they have enough loyalty not to turn on their masters.
38753 := Insults? Maybe if your Master had trained your lightsaber to be as quick as your tongue you could have escaped those Vulkars, you spoiled little Jedi princess!
38754 := I was not spoiled! I was given the same training as everyone else in the Order! You are nothing but a... no. I must not do this. There is no emotion; there is peace.
38755 := That's the problem with you Jedi. Always chanting about peace and control, never up for a good fight. Well, except for Revan, I guess.
38756 := Enough, Mandalorian. I won't rise to your bait any more. The game is over. Let us continue on with what we were doing.
38757 := Carth, you fought in the Mandalorian Wars, didn't you? We may have faced each other in combat. What battles were you in?
38758 := I try not to think about my past battles too much. The horrors of war are something I'd rather not relive.
38759 := The horrors of war? My people know only the glory of battle. I'm disappointed in you, Carth. I thought a warrior like you would understand.
38760 := I'm not a warrior, I'm a soldier. There's a difference. Warriors attack and conquer, they prey on the weak. Soldiers defend and protect the innocent - mostly from warriors.
38761 := Nice speech. I bet you tell yourself that every night so you can sleep. But I accept who and what I am. I don't have to justify it with words - victory in battle is my justification!
38762 := Justification through victory? So what happens when you lose? You know, like you did against us.
38763 := You had us outnumbered five to one. You had more ships, more troops, more supplies and the Jedi on your side. And we still made the Republic tremble before we fell!
38764 := Nice speech. I bet you tell yourself that every night so you can sleep. I don't want to talk about this anymore, Canderous. The war is over. You lost.
38765 := Uh, hey Carth. Can I... can I talk to you for a second?
38766 := Are you ready to have a civil chat? Or are is this going to be another childish tantrum?
38767 := Tantrum? I'm trying to apologize, you nerf-herder! Uh... I mean... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get mad at you. It's just that I'm sick of everyone treating me like I'm a helpless kid.
38768 := Yeah, I know. And I'm sorry about what I said, too. I'm just a little on edge lately. Not surprising considering all we've been through. But I shouldn't take it out on you.
38769 := Mission, you have to know that we don't think you're helpless. Look where we are, look at what we're doing. You're not just along for the ride.  We need you.
38770 := You really mean it, don't you? Nobody's ever said anything like that to me before, not even Big Z. He might think it, but he's not really one for words, you know. Thanks, Carth.
38771 := Ah, it's no big deal. I know how it is. Sometimes you just need to hear a few words of encouragement. Kids are like that.
38772 := Kids are like that?? Listen you... oh, I get it. Okay, you got me. You're pretty funny, Carth. For an old guy. Come on, you geezer - let's get back to what we were doing.
38773 := Hey, Carth. You're a pilot for the Republic, right? You've been all over the galaxy I bet, right? So tell me, how would you rate Taris compared to other worlds you've seen?
38774 := I'll be honest, Mission, Taris would rate pretty low. The prejudice, the rich spoiling themselves while the poor are crushed beneath them - not a pretty picture.
38775 := Yeah, but that's only since the Sith occupation. Before that... well, I guess it wasn't all that different, really. Hmm... maybe Taris ain't as great as I thought, you know?
38776 := Trust me, Mission. There are a lot of worlds better than Taris. There are worse, too. But Taris is no place for a kid to live on her own - even a kid who's got a Wookiee to look out for her.
38777 := Hey, I ain't no kid! And I look out for Zaalbar as much as he looks out for me. Big Z's my friend, not my babysitter! Geez, I come ask you a question and you give me a lecture!
38778 := Don't you snap at me, missy! You want a lecture? How's this: only bratty little children fly off the handle because of a simple comment.
38779 := I don't have to listen to you, Carth! You ain't my father - though you're sure old enough to be! So keep your lectures inside your withered old head, 'cause I don't need 'em!
38780 := And I sure as hell don't need this. Let's just drop it and get back to what we were doing.
38781 := Bastila, did you ever think about joining all the Jedi who were running off to follow Revan and Malak when they went to fight the Mandalorians?
38782 := That was nearly five years ago. I was still an apprentice, my Battle Meditation hadn't even manifested itself. Yet even then I had the wisdom to obey the will of the Council. Unlike Revan.
38783 := I guess. Still, do you ever wonder if things could have been different? Would Revan and Malak still have been corrupted if the Council had supported them instead of dragging its feet?
38784 := Do not blame Revan's corruption on the Council! Your Republic saw only the threat of the Mandalorians, but the wisdom of the Masters saw beyond the immediate threat.
38785 := There was something lurking out there, something that devoured Revan and Malak - and many other Jedi. Had the Council sent us all into the unknown, how many more would have fallen?
38786 := So you're saying we should have done nothing? Just let the Mandalorians conquer us unopposed? I mean, the Republic was under attack, and the Order abandoned us!
38787 := We did not abandon you! But the Council were not about to throw lives away foolishly. In time, we would have aided you against the Mandalorians. But you couldn't wait.
38788 := Revan and Malak offered a quicker answer, and the Republic chose to walk the easy path rather than the path of wisdom. Now we see the results all around us.
38789 := You asked me if I think things could have been different? I *know* they could have! If Revan had only listened to the Council, millions of innocent people would still be alive.
38790 := Yeah, right. And every single one of them would be speaking Mandalorain. I think we're done here. Let's just get back to the task at hand.
38791 := Bastila, I was wondering something. How did those Vulkars manage to capture a famous Jedi like you? Were you knocked out when your escape pod crashed?
38792 := No, I was conscious. But my Force powers were exhausted from using my Battle Meditation in the battle for the Endar Spire. Without my help you might never have gotten off the ship alive.
38793 := Fair enough. But I've seen you Jedi in action. There's no way those thugs would have stood a chance against your lightsaber.
38794 := My lightsaber was... misplaced. I couldn't find it after the crash. I looked *everywhere* in that pod. The Vulkars came and overwhelmed me even as I was searching for my weapon.
38795 := Wait a minute, let me get this straight. You *lost* your lightsaber? Ha-ha! I mean, isn't that a violation of some kind of Jedi code or something?
38796 := This is no laughing matter! During the crash my lightsaber must have... it must have fallen from my belt and rolled under my seat! The Vulkars probably found it there when they searched the wreckage.
38797 := Hey, hey, hey, don't get mad. I'm sorry. It's just funny to think of a legendary Jedi losing her lightsaber. Take my advice: this is one detail you might want to keep out of the history texts.
38798 := I hardly consider myself a legend, Carth. Though I will consider your advice when I relate these events to the Jedi Council. There is no need for them to know *every* detail of what transpired.
38799 := I think it's pretty clear that Malak is the tyrant in this case.
38800 := If you feel that way, why did you come with us?
38801 := Are you saying what we're doing isn't important?
38802 := Of course! Malak isn't evil, he's just misunderstood!
38803 := So you don't have a problem with Malak and the Sith?
38804 := Malak and the Sith are evil, Jolee! Surely you can see that.
38805 := Zaalbar looks fine to me.
38806 := She's got a point, Zaalbar. You could use a good makeover.
38807 := Yeah, I'm sure there were twenty of them. I mean, fifty... no, wait... a hundred!
38808 := Okay, let's not get into this.
38809 := Keep it cool, you two. I don't want this getting out of hand.
38810 := Yeah, Carth. When did you get all peace-loving on me?
38811 := Carth isn't like you, Canderous.
38812 := What's with all the apologies? I was hoping for another fight!
38813 := It's about time you two made up.
38814 := You're not going to take that from him, are you Mission?
38815 := Settle down right now - both of you!
38816 := Sounds like you're just making excuses, Bastila.
38817 := What did they see, exactly?
38818 := Leave her alone, Carth.
38819 := Maybe losing lightsabers is a side-effect of her Battle Meditation.
38820 := Of all the Jedi in the galaxy, why do we get one who's absent-minded?

38867 := We can't risk having any of the dark Jedi Masters recognize me. For the sake of the mission I must remain hidden in the Ebon Hawk while we are on this world.
38868 := [Bastila seems to have something on her mind. Perhaps you should talk to her about it.]
38869 := [You decide to ignore Bastila and continue on with your quest for now, though you might want to speak with her later.]
38870 := The Star Forge is under assault from the entire Republic fleet! If I don't use my Battle Meditation to turn the tide, Admiral Dodonna's capital ships will destroy the Star Forge.
38871 := I have to stay here in the command center so that I can best use my Battle Meditation against our enemy. If I don't the Star Forge will be lost!
38872 := You must go to face Malak without me. Find him, kill him and reclaim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith!
38873 := With each passing moment your old apprentice becomes stronger, Master. We must act quickly to exact your vengeance. Malak will pay for stealing the mantle of Dark Lord from you!
38874 := That's all for now.
38875 := Do you know if anything can be done about all these gizka on board?
38876 := Can you help me with my little stowaway problem?
38877 := [Don't speak to her.]
38878 := [Speak to Bastila.]
38879 := [Despite helping you on Taris, Canderous continues to be something of a mystery to you. It might be a good idea to try and get to know him better.]
38880 := [You decide to ignore Canderous and continue on with your quest for now, though it might be a good idea to speak with him later.]
38881 := Have you seen all these gizka on the ship?
38882 := Can you help me with our little stowaway problem?
38883 := Tell me about it later. I want to ask something else.
38884 := Maybe another time. I want to ask something else.
38885 := [Don't speak to him.]
38886 := [Speak to Canderous.]
38887 := [Something seems to be bothering Carth. Maybe you should speak to him and see if you can get him to open up about it.]
38888 := [You decide to ignore Carth and continue on with your quest for now, though it might be a good idea to speak with him later.]
38889 := Do you know if anything can be done about all these gizka?
38890 := Do you have any advice on our little stowaway?
38891 := Spit it out already.
38892 := I didn't ask for your advice, nor do I need it.
38893 := That settles that, I guess.
38894 := [Don't speak to him.]
38895 := [Speak to Carth.]
38896 := Beep beep beep-oop!
38897 := Please do excuse me, but I am required elsewhere.
38898 := I cannot render assistance, citizen. Move along.
38899 := We have a little stowaway problem. Can you help?
38900 := Do you know anything about these gizka, HK?
38901 := [Even though he has joined your group, Jolee remains a somewhat mysterious character. Maybe you should speak to him about why he chose to come with you.]
38902 := [You decide to ignore Jolee and continue on with your quest for now, though it might be a good idea to speak with him later.]
38903 := Have you seen all these gizka we have on board?
38904 := We have a stowaway on the ship. Do you have any advice for me?
38905 := [Don't speak to him.]
38906 := [Speak to Jolee.]
38907 := [Juhani seems tense and wary in your presence. Perhaps you could make her feel more welcome by talking with her.]
38908 := [You decide to ignore Juhani and continue on with your quest for now, though you might want to speak with her later.]
38909 := Do you know if anything can be done about all these gizka?
38910 := I was wondering if you could help me with our stowaway problem.
38911 := [Don't speak to her.]
38912 := [Speak to Juhani.]
38913 := [Mission seems rather distant. Maybe you should talk to her.]
38914 := [You decide to ignore Mission and continue on with your quest for now, though you might want to speak with her later.]
38915 := Do you know anything about these gizka creatures?
38916 := You got any advice on our little stowaway?
38917 := Sorry, but we don't have time for this now.
38918 := [Don't speak to her.]
38919 := [Speak to Mission.]
38920 := Weep-boop-beep-beep!
38921 := Beep-boop.
38922 := Beep-woop-woo.
38923 := You don't talk much, do you?
38924 := Just chime in if you ever have any advice.
38925 := I want to ask you some questions.
38926 := You don't even know what I was going to ask!

38931 := Galduran Calrissian's name was something of a liability after he became infamous for running an unsanctioned smuggling ring within Hutt space. Eventually cornered, he had to pawn even his personal items to avoid being the last Calrissian. The user must have paid points into the Demolitions and Security skills to gain the respective benefits from this belt.

38936 := Deflection: Energy, 20pts
Duration: 200 seconds,
or max damage taken

This is a basic model energy shield universally applicable to most droids. The power drain is significant, however, and units like this must be replaced regularly.
38937 := Deflection: Energy, 30pts
Duration: 200 seconds,
or max damage taken

Upgraded from the basic portable energy shield, these units are marketed to companies and governments that keep large standing forces of combat droids. The power drain is significant, however, and they must be replaced regularly.
38938 := Deflection: Energy, 50pts
Duration: 200 seconds,
or max damage taken

This sophisticated item is designed for top quality combat droids, and produces superior protection for any droid with the necessary software to install it. The power drain is significant, however, and it must be replaced regularly.
38939 := Deflection: Energy, Sonic, Cold, Heat, 20pts total
Duration: 200 seconds,
or max damage taken

Initially designed to resist the harsh conditions of factory floors, these shields provide a droid with basic protection against a broad array of effects. The power drain is significant, however, and they must be replaced regularly.
38940 := Deflection: Energy, Sonic, Cold, Heat, 30pts total
Duration: 200 seconds,
or max damage taken

This unit is an aftermarket modification of the shielding typically found on deep-core mining droids. It provides broad protection against many effects, but the power drain is significant and it must be replaced regularly.
38941 := Deflection: Energy, Sonic, Cold, Heat, 50pts total
Duration: 200 seconds,
or max damage taken

This variant of environmental shielding is designed for frontline combat droids. It provides broad protection against many effects, but the power drain is significant and it must be replaced regularly.

38945 := A life support pack contains dermal regenerators and other equipment for the treatment of wounds. They cannot be used by droids. Life support packs heal 30 vitality points + WIS modifier + (3 x user's skill in Treat Injury).
38946 := Each squad recovery stim includes a number of fittings to be placed on every member of the group (automatically done at purchase). When activated, a stim shot is triggered that heals everyone for 10 vitality points. This unit also includes electro-stim fittings that spur the auto-repair functions of droid group members, effectively repairing them for 10 vitality points as well.
38947 := Damage: None

38973 := You experienced a powerful vision upon first meeting Bastila. The vision could be an indication that you have a strong connection with the Force, but Bastila was reluctant to speculate on such matters.
38974 := Bendak is dead. Now all you have to do is go back to Zax and collect his bounty.
38975 := Canderous
38976 := You have been joined by Canderous Ordo, a skilled Mandalorian mercenary. You know little about him, however.
38977 := Canderous has told you a little bit about himself. He told of the great wars and battles his people had fought before, and how he had been reduced to serving Davik on a backwater world. He seemed to regret mentioning anything. Perhaps you should speak to him about this again later.
38978 := Canderous told you about what's it like to drop through the atmosphere in one of the Mandalorian's Basilisk war droids. From what he said, they must have been fearsome weapons. He would probably tell you more stories if you talked to him later.
38979 := You have heard Canderous' tale of his encounter in an asteroid field on the Outer Rim, but do not know what to make of it. Maybe talking to him further will make things more clear.
38980 := Canderous told you about the honors he won leading a unit in the battle over Althir. It seems that he was quite the warrior back then. You could probably hear more if you asked him again later.
38981 := You've heard from Canderous how the Mandalorians started their war on the Republic and the success they had at the beginning. If you talked to him later, he might tell you how the tide turned later on.
38982 := Canderous described the end of Mandalorian Wars to you. He seemed to admire Revan greatly. Maybe you can ask him about this later.
38983 := Canderous described the end of the Mandalorian Wars to you. He seemed to admire you greatly. Maybe he can tell you more later.
38984 := Canderous told how Revan and his forces destroyed the Mandalorians' weaponry and exiled them, scattering them across the Outer Rim. He thinks that now, with you, he might find worthy opponents once again. You might try to talk to him more later.
38985 := You have had a more personal moment with Canderous. He was talking about his work for Davik, and he mentioned that he seems to have changed from the warrior he once was. It may be that the time of the Mandalorians truly has past, and that Canderous may have to find some other meaning for his life. You may want to ask later about this.
38986 := Canderous has said that the time of the Mandalorians is past, that his kind no longer have a place in the galaxy anymore. He does not know what the future may hold for him, but thinks that he may be able to find out once his journey with you is done.
38987 := Canderous was affected oddly by his encounter with Jagi. He probably needs time to think about it and what it will mean for him.
38988 := Canderous has said that he will stand by you no matter what path you take or what enemies you face.
38989 := You've opened the Leviathan's hangar doors, but you can feel Darth Malak's presence drawing ever closer. Now you have to get off the ship before the Dark Lord arrives.
38990 := Zax was waiting for you when you returned. Dia's life was just business between you.
38991 := Dia is dead. Now all you have to do is go back to Zax to collect the bounty.
38992 := Dwindling Supplies
38993 := Zaalbar is concerned about the emergency food stores in the Ebon Hawk's cargo hold. The Wookiee's natural fixation on food might be causing him to worry unjustly, but you should still check it out just to be safe.
38994 := Something, or possibly someone, has been into the food supplies. You might want to conduct a search of the ship to try to find the culprit.
38995 := The mystery of the missing supplies is solved: a girl has been hiding on the ship and stealing food. Of course, now you have to figure out what to do with this stowaway...
38996 := In order to get inside the Sith academy in Dreshdae, you will have to be approved by one of the Sith as a worthy "hopeful". The one who does the deciding of which hopefuls make it is a Twi'lek Sith Master by the name of Yuthura Ban. She can reportedly be sometimes found in colony's cantina... you should check there.
38997 := You have heard that when a Sith accepts a hopeful as worthy they are given a medallion... which must then be presented to Yuthura Ban, the Sith Master who decides which hopefuls enter the academy. She can sometimes be found in the colony's cantina. You should probably check to see if she has returned to the cantina.
38998 := You've recovered the departure codes you need to escape Taris. Now you just have to bring them back to Canderous Ordo in the Lower City Cantina.
38999 := You've recovered the departure codes you need to escape Taris. Now you just have to find a fast ship to get you off the planet. Maybe someone in one of the cantinas could help you out.
39000 := Invited to a Party
39001 := You've been invited to a party by one of the Sith. According to the directions on your datapad they're getting together at an apartment on the east side of the North Upper City.
39002 := The Jedi Council on Dantooine has decided to train you in the ways of the ancient Jedi Order. After much initial training, your first task will be to learn the precepts of the Jedi Code. This code is the path by which all Jedi should lead their lives.

There is no emotion, there is peace. There is no ignorance, there is knowledge. There is no passion, there is serenity. There is no chaos, there is harmony. There is no death, there is the Force.
39003 := Juhani
39004 := The Jedi Council have said that you will be accompanied by Juhani, a young Cathar Jedi. She seems to be still troubled by her emotions. Perhaps in time you can help her.
39005 := Juhani has apologized for the way she acted towards you. She seems to be very hard on herself for her actions. If you talk to her more, you may find out more about her.
39006 := Juhani has told you of how she idolized Jedi in her youth and dreamed of being a Jedi. It would seem that she has succeeded in her desire. Maybe talking to her later will reveal more about her past.
39007 := You have heard from Juhani that her people were oppressed and ostracized by the human majority. It seems that the Jedi were the only ones to treat her fairly, and may be why she admires them so much. Perhaps in a little while she will reveal more.
39008 := You have learned a lot about Juhani's past now. She was, in fact, raised on Taris - the world which the Sith destroyed because of you and Bastila. Some of her bitterness may be explained now. If you ask after she has calmed down a bit, she might tell you more.
39009 := Juhani's parents fled to Taris from the homeworld of her species. Unfortunately for them, Taris was very oppressive towards alien species. Life was not easy for them. Perhaps she will tell you more in time.
39010 := Juhani has told of how she lived with her parents on Taris, and how her father was killed one day in bar fight. This is a very sensitive issue for her. She might tell you more in the future.
39011 := You have learned that after her father died, Juhani had been sold into slavery. When the Jedi came to Taris, they freed her and the other slaves. As soon as she was able, she left to find the Jedi and train with them. That is brought her to Dantooine.

She may yet have stories to tell. Perhaps you should ask her later.
39012 := Juhani has revealed that it was Revan's army that freed her, and it was Revan that she idolized so much. Maybe she will tell you more in time.
39013 := Juhani has taken the news of your past rather well. She believes that the good in you she knew as Revan could never be fully extinguished. You should not abuse her trust in you.
39014 := Juhani has thanked you for everything you have done for her. For saving her and for what you have done for the Jedi. She seems most grateful.
39015 := Juhani will stand by your side no matter what Malak may send against you.
39016 := Juhani has revealed that it was your army, as Revan, that freed her, and it was you that she idolized so much. Maybe she will tell you more in time.
39017 := Juhani doesn't think that the path you tread now is the same one you followed when your armies freed her. She hopes that your actions will prove yourself in the future.
39018 := Juhani has thanked you for everything you have done for her, and has expressed her feelings for you. You seem to mean more to her than she could ever admit before. Perhaps, once this is all over, there may be something for you.
39019 := According to Zax, Largo no longer has a price on his head. Hopefully he can stay out of trouble in the future.
39020 := Largo is dead. Now all you have to do is go back to Zax and collect the bounty.
39021 := Matrik is dead. Now all you have to do is go back to Zax to collect the bounty.
39022 := Purchasing a Droid
39023 := You're interested in purchasing a T3-M4 droid, but unfortunately it's being held for another buyer. There is nothing you can do about it for now.
39024 := Canderous has told you that Janice Nall has a droid in the her Upper City shop that could get you into the Sith base. He said to just mention his name and she'll sell him to you.
39025 := You've purchased the T3-M4 droid. If Canderous is right, it should be able to get you inside the Sith base.
39026 := You've acquired a sample of rakghoul serum. This could be very valuable to the right people.
39027 := You've found the journal of Rukil's apprentice near her corpse. You should return to the old man in the Outcast village to tell him of her fate, and to deliver the journal to him.
39028 := Selven is dead. Now all you have to do is go back to Zax to collect her bounty.
39029 := Your little stowaway is gone. For reasons you can only guess at, she decided to take her chances alone rather than remain with the crew of the Ebon Hawk. You doubt your paths will ever cross again.
39030 := As Arbiter you must defend Sunry to the best of your ability. However, you have found a data recording that clearly shows Sunry killing the Sith woman Elassa. Can you continue your role of Arbiter impartially, knowing that your client has committed such a crime?
39031 := You have managed to convince the Selkath court that Sunry is innocent of his crime. Sunry and Elora both thanked you profusely. They say they'll be heading off-world as soon as possible to get somewhere more peaceful.
39032 := You have managed to convince the Selkath court that Sunry is innocent of his crime. Sunry and Elora both thanked you profusely. They say they'll be heading off-world as soon as possible to get somewhere more peaceful.

In addition, you proved that the Sith were guilty of trying to frame Sunry. The Ahto City authorities have imposed additional sanction on the Sith in the form of subsidies towards kolto purchases. This should make things easier in the future.
39033 := You have found a journal detailing the search for the Promised Land. Alone it isn't worth much, but with the journal of Rukil's apprentice and one more journal it might reveal the true location of the Promised Land.
39034 := You have found another journal detailing the search for the Promised Land. With the journal of Rukil's apprentice and the other journal you have, it looks like you have all the clues to reveal the true location of the Promised Land.
39035 := You are stranded on Taris, a planet under Sith control. Now you and Carth Onasi must find  Bastila - the only person capable of stopping the Sith from conquering the entire galaxy. You should probably begin by investigating reports of escape pods that crashed into the Undercity.
39036 := You've been invited to a party being given by one of the off duty Sith officers. Going there might be risky, but it could also get you a step closer to finding Bastila.
39037 := The Sith at the party underestimated the infamous kick of Tarisian ale, giving you ample opportunity to search their belongings while they sleep off the effects of the powerful drink.
39038 := You've managed to get your hands on the prototype swoop accelerator. Now you just have to bring it back to Gadon and his Hidden Beks and hope they come through on their end of the bargain.
39039 := Despite all odds, you managed to win the swoop race. However, Brejik refused to give Bastila to you as promised. Somehow you're not surprised.
39040 := You have heard mention of a powerful sword that might be found within the tomb of an ancient Sith Lord, Ajunta Pall.
39041 := You've loaded the information on ancient Rakata weapons and technology into your datapad. Now you must bring it back to the One as proof that the Red Rakata have been destroyed.
39042 := You have discovered a stash of spice inside the secret compartment on the Ebon Hawk. You will have to deliver it to Lurze on Korriban if you want to get paid for it.
39043 := Dantooine - Jedi Enclave
39044 := This is futile, master! Why must you keep me back like this? Why can I not learn to fight with a real lightsaber?
39045 := Do not underestimate the strength of your Cortosis blade, young Padawan.
39046 := It is not a lightsaber! It is nothing!
39047 := And perhaps that is the reason you have not advanced to lightsaber training.
39048 := You are too headstrong, too overeager to move on without the knowledge necessary to use what you learn.
39049 := A lightsaber is a delicate and subtle weapon. One that can cause great harm to its wielder if not used properly.
39050 := I believe we have trained enough for now. Reflect on what you have learned, Padawan. Through learning comes knowledge.
39051 := There is no ignorance. There is knowledge.
39052 := Yes, master. Thank you.
39053 := The crystals are sacred! No self-respecting Jedi would ever do such a thing!
39054 := What's the big deal? It's not like you'd be hurting anyone. There's plenty of crystals in that cave, so what's the harm in giving me a couple?
39055 := You wouldn't be the first, you know. I don't think the Jedi Council approves, but they don't make a big deal about it. They've got more important things to worry about.
39056 := How dare you make such an offer! This is an insult to everything the Jedi stand for!
39057 := This doesn't seem like an honorable thing to do. It feels wrong to me.
39058 := I'm not an expert on the Jedi, but this seems like the kind of thing that could get a person into a lot of trouble.
39059 := He makes a good case. It's not like you'd be stealing or killing anyone or anything.
39060 := Ha! Good to see things in this Jedi enclave work just like they do out in the real world. Everyone's looking out for number one.
39061 := I want to be a Jedi Consular!
39062 := I want to be a Jedi Sentinel!
39063 := I want to be a Jedi Guardian!
39064 := Master Tar'eelok is a most knowledgeable teacher.
39065 := There is no ignorance, there is..... No! No! I have to know this!
39066 := I must train harder to become a good Jedi.
39067 := This has been a painful lesson, Juhani, but it seems you have learned it well. I am certain you will be a credit to the Order.
39068 := Giving you a second chance like this is a clear sign of weakness. Sometimes I find it hard to believe the Jedi could defeat my people in battle.
39069 := You have been given another chance to prove yourself. I hope you use it well.
39070 := First the Jedi trick you into becoming an enemy, then they welcome you back as a friend. I can't say I approve of their training methods.
39071 := Hey, I'm glad to see you're not getting hung up on all this. The past is in the past, you know?
39072 := Care to have a hand of Pazaak with me?
39073 := Ah, well. Come back if you ever feel up to a game.
39074 := A marvelous card game indeed. It's sweeping the galaxy I've heard. While I'm no master myself, I do have some proficiency.
39075 := I happen to have a spare deck on me. I can sell it to you for 100 credits if you want.
39076 := That's unfortunate. If you ever find the credits, I'd be happy to sell it to you. Perhaps we could even have a hand or two if you're willing to wager something.
39077 := Good, good. Here is your deck. As a bonus, I'll give you a digital copy of the instructions for novice players.
39078 := Now... want to play a hand or two?
39079 := That last game was closer than it seemed. Want to try it again?
39080 := You are truly a great Pazaak player. I don't see how I could possibly beat you.
39081 := Rest assured that one day I will, though.
39082 := As a token of my appreciation for games well played, please take these cards. Perhaps it will serve you better than they did me.
39083 := I haven't seen you around here before... I'm a traveller in search of a little entertainment. 
39084 := You've the look of a seasoned Pazaak player about you. I dabble in it from time to time myself. Care for a game?
39085 := Let's get started then.
39086 := I am Sol'aa and, to be perfectly blunt, my business is my own. I do offer you, though, the company of my time for a game or two of Pazaak.
39087 := Do you care for a hand?
39088 := Not right now.
39089 := I don't have a deck.
39090 := What's Pazaak?
39091 := I don't have that much.
39092 := Sure. Here are the credits.
39093 := Not right now.
39094 := Sure, I'll play.
39095 := Who are you?
39096 := Yes, Padawan? What is it you require?
39097 := I hope that the Force guides you well on your quest, Padawan.
39098 := Yes, apprentice? What is it you require?
39099 := As you will.
39100 := The Cortosis mineral is a rare and unique substance that has the property of being able to deflect the beam of a lightsaber.
39101 := Although the process for forging it into blades was developed by the Echani for their dueling culture, it has since spread across the galaxy.
39102 := The Sith have taken to providing blades of this type to their mercenaries and pawns, so that they would prove more effective against us.
39103 := It does raise the possibility of those same mercenaries being effective against their Sith masters in turn, but given the overpowering military might of the Sith at the moment, it is unlikely.
39104 := They are great and powerful Jedi, all. Do not be intimidated by them, however. If there is something you wish to know from them, merely ask.
39105 := I am Master Tar'eelok. I train here with, and under, Master Zhar Lestin.
39106 := A Jedi's training is never over, even when one has a padawan of their own.
39107 := Knowledge will be the key to our eventual victory over the Sith. Knowledge of our weaknesses and theirs.
39108 := Knowing yourself is the key to any great battle.
39109 := Is there anything else you require?
39110 := The Mandalorians have been scattered across the Outer Rim since their defeat by the Republic years ago. They have managed to survive by raiding for food and credits.
39111 := I have not heard much about any activities of theirs on Dantooine. I spend much of my time in seclusion meditating. Perhaps another may help you.
39112 := The dark side holds great sway over people, places and things. It is not always obvious from where this dark power comes.
39113 := If the Council has told you to investigate, perhaps you should do just that.
39114 := There is much to learn of the Jedi Code, and much subtlety in what is there.
39115 := You would do well to learn from the example of my student, Garrum: There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
39116 := Know this, and you can never fail.
39117 := For the rest of the Code, I suggest you ask some of the other Jedi here. Know your peers as well.
39118 := It was most regrettable that you could not save Juhani. She was an endearing, if rash, pupil.
39119 := Do not let the lessons she has given us all elude you.
39120 := You have done well in bringing Juhani back into the light. I am sure that once she gets past her remorse, she will be a model Jedi.
39121 := If you are not a student here, then your questions should be addressed to the Jedi Council.
39122 := I am afraid that I am too busy to answer you questions.
39123 := I must go now.
39124 := What is this Cortosis ore you mentioned?
39125 := What do you know of the Council?
39126 := Who are you?
39127 := What can you tell me about the Mandalorian raiders?
39128 := Do you know anything about the corrupted grove?
39129 := I wish to know about the Jedi Code.
39130 := *whisper* Anyone can see that he doesn't believe you. He must have some reason for letting this slide. Probably trying to teach you some Jedi lesson or something.
39131 := *whisper* It's obvious he doesn't believe you. He must have some reason for letting you get away with this lie. I swear, I'll never understand these Jedi.
39132 := *whisper* It is obvious Master Vandar senses something is amiss in your tale. Yet he chooses to believe you, and I will not question the wisdom of a Jedi Master.
39133 := *whisper* It is obvious Master Vandar senses something is not right with your story. Yet he chooses to believe you, and I will not question the wisdom of a Jedi Master.

39179 := I find that very odd, for most people would seek shelter indoors when the sky is filled with dark stormclouds as it was earlier today. But that is not the most puzzling aspect of the case.
39180 := I suppose we are left with only one option... the blood is Handon's. Perhaps I should examine him more closely.
39181 := It seems there is one likely scenario: Rickard killed Calder for cheating him in business. While shooting Calder, he must have also hit Handon by accident.
39182 := We know Calder was having an affair with Handon's wife, but what possible motive could Rickard have for wanting Calder dead?
39183 := Your theory makes no sense to me. As a Jedi you must be above making wild, unsubstantiated accusations.
39184 := We know Calder was cheating Rickard in business, but what possible motive could Handon have for wanting Calder dead?
39185 := Handon found him first and shot him because of the affair Calder was having with his wife. Shortly after, Rickard arrived on the scene.
39186 := From a distance he saw Handon and thought it was Calder, so he shot him in retaliation for the credits Calder had cheated him out of in their business.
39187 := Your theory makes no sense to me. As a Jedi you must be above making wild, unsubstantiated accusations.
39188 := That information would have been easily accessible through the information droid. You should have looked into it during your investigation.
39189 := It would seem there is one logical scenario: Handon killed Calder for having an affair with his wife. Rickard was out hunting and accidentally shot Handon after he had killed Calder.
39190 := But Handon's guilt does not absolve you of your part in this, Rickard. If you confess the Council will go easier on you.
39191 := So the blaster could be linked to anyone. I'm afraid that is not very helpful. Maybe this case is too complicated for you to solve.
39192 := You have done well, but maybe this is beyond your training. Perhaps it would be best if I returned to the Enclave and handled this myself. Unless you wish to continue your investigations?
39193 := So we have caught Handon in a lie. Interesting, but I think we may need one final piece of the puzzle.
39194 := It is possible that Rickard may have shot Calder accidentally and Handon may have found the body, but that seems a very unlikely explanation. It is more likely that at least one of them is lying.
39195 := You should speak to the witnesses and the information droid before we try to figure out this puzzle. You will need the facts if we are to continue.
39196 := I find that very odd, for most people would seek shelter indoors when the sky is filled with dark stormclouds as it was earlier today. But that is not the most puzzling aspect of the case. 
39197 := Apprentice, it would seem that I require your assistance.
39198 := I am Bolook, a Jedi from the Enclave. I was sent by the Jedi Council to investigate a killing that took place here a few hours ago.
39199 := Communication does not pose a problem, as both the suspects and I speak Basic and Huttese.
39200 := I am not familiar with the customs and nature of humans though, and the story the two suspects have been telling confuses me.
39201 := Though you are not yet a full Jedi, perhaps you could assist me in sorting out the truth from the lies.
39202 := I understand, but I do not think I can adequately render a verdict in this case.
39203 := If you are not willing to assist me, then I must bring the suspects before the Jedi Council to resolve this matter. Are you sure you will not assist me?
39204 := I find your demeanor most unbecoming in a prospective Jedi. I think that your mentors have perhaps been lax in your training.
39205 := I regret that you feel you cannot assist me. I will remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave for judgment. May the Force be with you.
39206 := I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, apprentice.
39207 := I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, Padawan.
39208 := Ah, that is good. Perhaps then, we can get to the bottom of this mystery.
39209 := As far as I can determine, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke.
39210 := The dead man, Calder Nettic, was shot in the back with a blaster rifle. A rifle was found lying near his body with blood stains on it.
39211 := Two other men were found at the scene when I arrived. One was Handon Guld. He was unarmed. The other was Rickard Lusoff, who was carrying a hunting laser.
39212 := Both men say they did not do anything, and that they came across the body. But both also accuse the other. It is most perplexing.
39213 := Listen to the stories given by the two suspects. I have brought an information retrieval droid with access to the archives both at the Jedi Enclave and the planetary capital.
39214 := I am sure that one of the suspects is lying, but they are being so inconsistent that I find it hard to know what may possibly motivate them.
39215 := Listen to their stories, and check the facts with the information droid. Once you have gathered all the evidence you think you need, run through the possible scenario with me.
39216 := If you cannot spare them time, or we cannot sort this situation out satisfactorily, I will be forced to take this case before the Jedi Council.
39217 := Padawan, it would seem that I require your assistance.
39218 := I am Bolook, a Jedi from the Enclave. I was sent by the Jedi Council to investigate a killing that took place here a few hours ago.

39239 := It didn't belong to the victim.
39240 := No, they are both guilty.
39241 := He wanted to rob Calder.
39242 := Rickard thought Calder was cheating him in business!
39243 := He wanted to rob Calder.
39244 := Handon admited that Calder was having an affair with his wife!
39245 := He was jealous of Calder's good looks!
39246 := No, Handon is the guilty one.
39247 := I agree.
39248 := No, they are both guilty.
39249 := No, Rickard is the guilty one.
39250 := I agree.
39251 := I haven't learned anything yet.
39252 := The blaster didn't belong to the victim.
39253 := The blaster is Handon's, but he reported it stolen.
39254 := I can't solve this. I give up.
39255 := Let me get more information on the blaster.
39256 := The blaster is Handon's. He lied about it being stolen.
39257 := I'm stumped.
39258 := Just a theory.
39259 := I want to discuss the murder.
39260 := I will begin my investigaton at once.
39261 := Is there anything else I should know?
39262 := What sort of assistance?
39263 := What do you want?
39264 := Who are you?
39265 := Sorry, I do not have time for this.

39282 := You knew Calder better than you admit. You rented a speeder with him!
39283 := I want the truth - now!
39284 := You better come clean!
39285 := Punch his face in? Why?
39286 := You wanted to kill Calder for having an affair with your wife!
39287 := I want to ask you something else.
39288 := Tell me about the weapon found at the scene.
39289 := You thought Calder was cheating you!
39290 := You can deny it, but there was bad blood between you!

39366 := It seems our little stowaway is gone.
39367 := I saw her sneaking off the ship. I called out to her, but she ran off. I guess she figured it was time to leave.
39368 := That seems kind of harsh, but I guess she'll be okay on her own. She's a survivor, after all.
39369 := It was hard enough discovering her on this little ship. We'll never find her if we have to search an entire planet.
39370 := But I wouldn't worry about her. She's a survivor, she'll be okay.
39371 := You're probably right. She's a survivor, after all.
39372 := That might be why she left. Maybe her instincts warned her we were headed for trouble... trouble she wanted no part of.
39373 := I guess there's nothing more we can do but continue our search for the Star Maps. I hope things work out - for her and for us.
39374 := I don't have time to worry about this now!

39473 := You need to equip a weapon for combat!
39474 := Use the EQUIP screen to equip the armor and weapons from your inventory. You can access this by pressing the [START] button on your controller.
39475 := Use the D-pad to cycle through your inventory slots. The menu on the right displays items you can equip in each slot.

39480 := Hitting the buttons over and over again will not speed up your attacks and will not help you in combat! Combat uses a real-time, turn based system.
39481 := Each character can only perform one action in each 3 second round. When a new round begins the character will perform the last command you selected.
39482 := Combat uses a pause and play system. At any time you can press the <whbutton> to pause the game and issue commands to your characters.
39483 := While the game is paused you can use the triggers to select a target, you can use the D-pad to select icons from the ACTION MENU and you can switch characters using <blbutton>.
39484 := Any commands you issue to your party while paused will fire when you press the <whbutton> to unpause the game.
39485 := In the lower left of the screen you'll see a list of icons. This is your ACTION MENU. You can cycle left and right through these icons at any time using the D-pad.
39486 := The icons in your ACTION MENU will change depending on whether your targeting circle is on a door, a container, a friendly creature or an enemy.  Press <abutton> to activate a highlighted icon.
39487 := In combat, the far left icon defaults to a basic attack. The second icon shows your available FEATS. Use the D-pad to select this icon, then press <abutton> to use the FEAT.
39488 := The fourth icon is for offensive items like grenades; the icon on the far right shows defensive items like medpacs and the fifth shows defensive Force powers like "Heal".
39489 := The third icon shows offensive Force powers like Choke and Lightning.
39490 := Use the D-pad to cycle left or right through the icons of the ACTION MENU until you highlight the action, item or FEAT you want to use. Then press <abutton>.

39502 := For the Republic!
39503 := The Sith want Bastila alive, but once she's off the ship there's nothing stopping them from blasting the Endar Spire into galactic dust!
39504 := I should equip a melee weapon, too. Either that, or I'll have to stay back and use my blaster.
39505 := First, use <blbutton> to take control of the injured character. Use the D-pad to cycle left or right through the icons of the ACTION MENU until you see "medpac" in the information box.
39506 := Notice the flashing up and down arrows on this icon. This means you have more than one available option for this icon. You must choose between a medpac and an advanced medpac.
39507 := Use the D-pad to scroll up or down to switch between your medpac and your advanced medpac. Press <abutton> to use the selected item on the character you currently control.
39508 := In the lower left of the screen you'll see a list of icons. This is your ACTION MENU. You can cycle left and right through these icons at any time using the D-pad.
39509 := The icons in your ACTION MENU will change depending on whether your targeting circle is on a door, a container, a friendly creature or an enemy.  Press <abutton> to activate a highlighted icon.
39510 := The icon on the far left is always the default action for the target: OPEN for doors or containers, DIALOG for friends, and ATTACK for enemies.The second icon shows your feats and skills.
39511 := The fourth icon is for offensive items like grenades; the icon on the far right shows defensive items like medpacs and the fifth shows defensive Force powers like "Heal".

39518 := There's a map of the Endar Spire and a copy of Carth's message in your electronic journal, just in case we get separated.
39519 := We should stick together; you'll have more success with a party than on your own.
39520 := Okay.
39521 := I know about the ACTION MENU. How do I use a medpac?
39522 := Can you repeat that?
39523 := Okay.

39609 := What do you want now? I don't want to waste my off time just talking.
39610 := Oh, hello again. Did you want another game? I don't think there will be any ships in for quite a while.
39611 := Ah, it's you again. Want another game? You've been the most challenge I've had for... I don't know how long. Not a lot of dockside Pazaak champions.
39612 := Well, that was quite the victory. What is that, ten, eleven times you've won? Good games, though. Best fun I've had in a while.
39613 := Heh, maybe I should give you something else. Ten or more wins is considered a tournament victory by some players. Not that I ever get to tournaments...
39614 := Here, take these. I don't get much time to use them and they don't seem to be doing me much good anyway.
39615 := You don't have to take them if you don't want. If they're such a hassle, you're the fool for still playing. I'm just killing time.
39616 := I don't know about that. I just play for fun.
39617 := Well, you beat me fair on that hand. That was pretty well played. I made a few mistakes I shouldn't have.
39618 := You're beating me fairly regular. I'm going to have to try a few different strategies from now on.
39619 := Well, looks like you've got some skill. Could be beginner's luck, though. Want another game?
39620 := Of course, you're making a habit of beating me. I should know when to quit, but what else is there to do here?
39621 := I beat you good on that one. Sorry, but that's the way the cards go. Just the luck of the draw, I guess.
39622 := You've beat me before, though, and I bet you want to try again. I always tell people never to quit on a loss.
39623 := That's a surprise. You've won so many times I thought you were sure to beat me again.
39624 := That's got to be rough, but things can change fast. You'll want to keep playing, I bet. Never quit on a loss.
39625 := What do you want? I don't get a lot of time off from loading cargo, so if you've got something to say, make it quick.
39626 := All right. Goodbye. I have to get back to work anyway.
39627 := I heard something about Taris but I didn't really know anyone from there so I haven't paid attention. Does that sound bad?
39628 := I just figure that whatever is going on, whoever is in charge will still always need someone to load crates.
39629 := What? Oh, you mean Edean? I suppose the Wookiees can call their planet whatever they want, but the company pays to name the trade routes.
39630 := I don't know much about it, though. I stay here and load cargo. You're better off asking the patrol guards or Janos.
39631 := I like playing more than talking about it. What did you want?
39632 := I don't want to go into all of it. You'll have to read the rules yourself. Here, shove this pamphlet into your journal.
39633 := That should cover everything you need to know.
39634 := Oh, I'm not actually considered a real employee. At least, not enough to get one of those uniforms they strut around in. I just load cargo.
39635 := When a ship comes in I work straight through the day, but mostly I just pass the time playing Pazaak. Want a game?
39636 := It will be a while before another ship comes in, so go ahead.
39637 := Don't have one? I'm surprised. You probably spend a lot of time on trade routes and such, and there's nothing better to kill the time.
39638 := I might have... yes, here we are, I have a spare deck. I could sell it to you for maybe... 75 credits. It's pretty basic.
39639 := I don't know if I can do that. It is a spare, but I could use the money to buy better cards for my main deck.
39640 := [Success] I want to give you the deck. Sure I do. I mean, how else am I going to get anyone to play with?
39641 := [Failure] I don't know about that. I'm sure I'll find someone eventually. I think I'll hang on to it.
39642 := [Success] I suppose that makes sense. I mean, I don't really need it, and how else will I get someone to play me?
39643 := Here you are. You'll want to go over the rules too. I have a pamphlet you can load into your journal, though you probably already have one.
39644 := You'll want to find some cards to improve that deck. Like I said, it's pretty basic. When you think you're ready, we'll have a game.
39645 := Sure. I'd like to make up for you beating me again. Not that I can't afford it. No where else to spend my money.
39646 := Yeah, I suppose you would want to make up for your last loss. You've won before, so this should be a good game.
39647 := Bet what you want. It's not like I can spend my money anywhere else on this planet.
39648 := We'll make the stakes interesting, but not too high. We're not playing at that level yet.
39649 := Low stakes for now, but we'll raise them later.
39650 := Sure, you had a good start, so let's keep going. I don't mind the occasional loss to a good player.
39651 := Sure. I'm not sure I'd keep playing after a start like yours, so maybe we should keep the wager low until you get better.
39652 := Sure, let's go. Just a small wager to start, though, because I don't know how good you are. It's kind of a courtesy to new players.
39653 := Eh, I suppose, but I think it's pretty clear that you are the better player. You've won a lot. I suppose I can afford it, though.
39654 := It beats taking your paltry surplus credits.
39655 := That's very sporting of you.
39656 := I have to go. Goodbye.
39657 := Heard any off-planet rumors?
39658 := I have some questions about Kashyyyk?
39659 := I want to ask about Pazaak
39660 := Can you tell me the rules?
39661 := What do you do for Czerka Corporation?
39662 := Let's go back to my other questions.
39663 := Where would I get a Pazaak deck?
39664 := I don't have that much. Would you go lower?
39665 := [Force Persuade] You want to give me the deck.
39666 := [Persuade] Nobody else is asking. Who else will play you?
39667 := I'll pay 75 credits. Give me the deck.

39808 := You will have to follow whatever your instincts tell you. These were tests for individual warriors. I am sorry I can't be of more help.
39809 := It is a description of the ritual you have already completed. We need not concern ourselves with it.
39810 := Whatever. Just tell me what you know about it.
39811 := Can you shed any light on this?
39812 := The vine... I remember this. There were hunters that would tell of the trial... of how the chieftain Rothrrrawr was nearly killed.
39813 := It was said that he lost the blade to Bacca's sword in a place just like this, foolishly challenging the Great Beast. I wonder...
39814 := Very well.
39815 := No! No, we must do this. We can complete the ritual and summon the Great Beast. Perhaps that is the way to repair Bacca's sword.
39816 := Here, I think this is how it was supposed to be done. Take the viper kinrath corpse we found and tie it to the vine. Then we wait.
39817 := Very well, but it should be done.
39818 := Your tone mocks the ritual, but this is how it was done for generations. It is how we proved our worth... and punished for Rothrrrawr's arrogance.
39819 := Not much. I believe a specific creature was killed to hang from the vine. This served as bait for the larger more dangerous beasts.
39820 := We should seek out a suitable creature to place on the vine. I don't know what will happen, but it is worth trying.
39821 := We have a viper kinrath corpse. Perhaps that is what is required for the ritual. Perhaps we were meant to do this. Tie it to the vine.
39822 := Never mind for now.
39823 := Perhaps later.

39831 := This place feels wrong to me; it is tainted by the Star Map's very existence. We should return to the treetops as soon as possible.
39832 := The Shadowlands are a dark and dangerous place. I am not surprised to find the Star Map here, though I cannot help but wonder if the Star Map predates the forest itself.
39833 := The Shadowlands are a dark and dangerous place. I am not surprised to find the Star Map here, though I cannot help but wonder if the Star Map predates the forest itself.
39834 := Observation: This is a strange place to encounter a Star Map, Master. Down here it is unlikely anyone would ever find it.
39835 := Conjecture: Do you suppose the Star Map predates the trees themselves?
39836 := An excellent point, Master. Now that we have what we came for I do hope we will be leaving this world soon. All this flora and fauna is so very tiresome.
39837 := Why would anyone hide a Star Map here in the Shadowlands?  No one's ever going to see it, so what's the point?
39838 := I guess it's possible the Star Map could have been built before these trees popped up. It's just hard to imagine Kashyyyk with no forests, you know?
39839 := Hey, this place is starting to give me the creeps. We've got the Star Map, let's just get out of here, okay?
39840 := What good is a Star Map buried at the bottom of the damn Shadowlands? Nobody'd ever find it here, so what's the point?
39841 := I suppose if the Star Map is as old as everyone seems to think it could have been here before all these damn trees. It's just hard to imagine.
39842 := But I don't want to stand around here chatting about this. Too many spots for an ambush. We've got what we came for - let's just head back to the treetops.
39843 := This doesn't make any sense. Why put a Star Map here in the Shadowlands? Who's ever going to see it?
39844 := I suppose it's possible the Star Map was built before these trees were ever here. It's just hard to imagine this world without these massive forests.
39845 := You know what? This place is making me uneasy. We've got the Star Map, let's just get out of here.
39846 := The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The horrors that live here in the Shadowlands could be the result of thousands of generations affected by the Star Map's power.
39847 := Come. We should leave this place. There is nothing else for us here.
39848 := The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The horrors that live here in the Shadowlands could be the result of thousands of generations affected by the Star Map's power.
39849 := Come. We should leave this place. There is nothing else for us here.
39850 := Well, well. A Star Map. An ancient artifact of dark side power. Can't say I'm surprised. I always knew there was something funny down here.
39851 := I wonder if the Star Map has had an effect on the evolution of the creatures here in the Shadowlands. Might explain why it's so dangerous down here.
39852 := An interesting theory, but I suppose we don't have time to test it now, do we? Now that we've got what you came for we should be heading back up to the treetops.
39853 := I agree. It's amazing the Star Map is still working after all these years.
39854 := You're right. Let's get moving.
39855 := Who cares. We found what we were looking for.
39856 := Possibly. The Star Map is incredibly ancient.
39857 := [Examining the corpse of this great beast, you find a blade of some sort lodged in its side. Skin has grown around it.]
39858 := [While certainly painful, it appears the blade caused only surface damage to the creature. Who knows how long it lived with this injury.]  
39859 := [You remove the blade from the corpse. The only flaw appears to be a missing hilt. Obviously the sword came apart when the blade lodged within this creature.]
39860 := [You remove the blade from the corpse. It must be the one that Freyyr spoke of, the lost portion of Bacca's sword, a powerful symbol of his people.]
39861 := [You remove the blade from the corpse. Even with only a quick examination it is an obvious match for the hilt you recieved from Chuundar.]
39862 := [The blade and hilt snap together with ease, and the weapon is whole once more. It appears functional, even after all this time.]
39863 := That blade... I know it from the stories. It is a match for the hilt Chuundar gave me. Here, let me see.
39864 := Even after all this time... look, they fit as though just made. Bacca's Ceremonial Blade... mine...
39865 := You don't need to tell me again about my debt. I know my place, both with you and here on Kashyyyk. The old ways are dead.
39866 := Of course, if the old ways are dead, what use do I have for debts of honor. I could rule here... if this blade was a symbol anyone still recognized...
39867 := Use it, of course. It has no more worth to my people. Not with Chuundar as chieftain. The old ways are dead. You showed me that.
39868 := No, this sword will serve me as I see fit. It is no longer a symbol that anyone here recognizes. Still... maybe...
39869 := No, no I am through with this place. Let's go find some prey. I want to see how Bacca's toy cuts.

40174 := Well, if you get enough, come back and maybe we can have a game.
40175 := That was a good game. It was closer than I'd have thought. You interested in another?

40396 :=   
40397 :=

40399 := Patience, Commander. ## My new apprentice is nearly ready. ## Once Bastila joins her Battle Meditation to our enormous fleet, we shall be invincible.  Then we shall begin our final conquest of the Core Worlds, and the Republic will be crushed forever.
40400 := As you wish, Lord Malak.
40401 := temp
40402 := If they can find Bastila, they may be able to distract her attention from the battle overhead. ## That should allow you to move your capital ships into postion for a final assault on the Star Forge itself.
40403 :=  If Malak is distracted by the attack, we should be able to get in close enough to dock on the Star Forge and hunt the Dark Lord down!
40404 := This is Admiral Forn Dodonna to the Ebon Hawk, do you read us?
40405 := Admiral Dodonna, this is Bastila Shan of the Jedi Order.  We are receiving your transmission.
40406 := It is good to hear your voice Bastila.  We had thought you were lost to us.  Carth's transmission reported that Malak had taken you prisoner.
40407 := The Jedi sent to rescue me from the Dark Lord did their job well - though I am sorry to report Carth did not survive the mission.
40408 := His loss is a great blow to the Republic.  We could have used him in this battle.
40409 := We were about to pull back.
40410 := We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.
40411 := We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.
40412 := We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.
40413 := We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.
40414 := Don't pull back, Admiral.  You have to attack the Star Forge now, otherwise the Sith will use its power to destroy the Republic.
40415 := I'll try to press the attack but we can't hold out much longer.  Not unless you can use your Battle Meditation to turn the tide.
40416 := This is Master Vandar.  A number of Jedi Knights have joined the fleet, under his command.
40417 := Bastila's power could help you win this battle, Admiral, but it will mean nothing if Malak escapes.  Destroying the Star Forge is secondary to stopping the Sith threat once and for all.
40418 := What are you proposing?
40419 := A small squadron of Jedi Knights in snub fighters could penetrate the Sith blockade and dock on the space station.  If they can find Malak we can end the threat of the Sith ## ...forever.
40420 := I'll order the fleet to press the attack and provide some cover for your fighters.  But what of Bastila and her Battle Meditation?
40421 := Bastila, you and... the Padawan... should join us.  We will need the combined strength of our entire Order to defeat Malak.
40422 := As you wish, Master Vandar.
40423 := And may the Force be with you.
40424 := The fools!  Even Master Vandar did not realize you have reclaimed your identity as the Dark Lord! ## The Jedi strike team and the Republic forces will provide the perfect distraction as we hunt down your ex-apprentice.  And once we have slain Malak, I can use my Battle Meditation ## and the power of the Star Forge to crush the Republic fleet.
40425 := All our enemies will be destroyed in a single glorious day!
40426 := From Coruscant to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rims you will be known as the saviors of the Republic!
40427 := On behalf of the Jedi Council, defenders of the galaxy and sworn protectors of the Republic... ## I too would like to honor you for your actions. ##   ## We Jedi now have another tale to weave... ## into the grand history of our eternal Order - the Redemption... ## of Revan, the prodigal knight.
40428 := Wherever you go you will be recognized as the saviors of the galaxy. The heroes of our age.  But you must remain ever vigilant. ## For one day you may be called upon yet again to defend the glory of the Republic...  ## against the tyranny... ## of the dark side, ## for this... ## is the destiny... ## of the Jedi.

40435 := She sliced that guy up. She's only getting what she deserves!
40436 := Out of my way, old man!
40437 := I'm sorry I was rude to you earlier.
40438 := Look, I know we're trying to keep a low profile but this kind of attitude will draw attention we don't need.
40439 := I know it's really none of my business, but you look like someone who might need to purchase one of those new energy shields. They're the latest thing, you know. Very high tech.
40440 := Oh, okay. Well then, you might be interested in knowing I have one for sale. It isn't cheap, but it could be the difference between life and death.
40441 := When you use one it surrounds you with a radiant aura-particle mesh that absorbs blaster bolts. Pretty handy in a fight. The shield even protects against lightsabers, or so I hear.
40442 := The shields aren't perfect, of course. They can only absorb so much energy damage before they burn out, and ion blasters will take your basic dueling shield down pretty quick.
40443 := And they aren't any good at all against a simple vibroblade. That's why the Sith and the Republic are training their troops in hand-to-hand and melee combat.
40444 := And I can tell you from experience that they aren't any good at all against a simple vibroblade. That's why the Republic has been training soldiers in hand-to-hand and melee combat.
40445 := I've heard rumors of the Echani using shields like this, but I never saw anything like them around here. Not until the Sith came. Where they discovered the technology is anybody's guess.
40446 := The shields are too rare and too expensive to hand out to an entire army, but a shielded strike team can take out a whole battalion of soliders armed with conventional blasters.
40447 := It gave the Sith a huge edge in the early battles, but it wasn't long before the Republic was able to copy the technology and come up with energy shields of their own.
40448 := Now both sides are scrambling to come up with new weapons to slice right through the shields, but until they do you're going to see melee combat coming back to the forefront in this war.
40449 := Not much more to say, really. Except that I've managed to get my hands on one of those shields. It isn't cheap, but it could mean the difference between life and death.
40450 := I know all about energy shields.
40451 := What's so great about these energy shields?
40452 := I've heard enough about these shields.
40453 := Where did this technology come from?
40454 := Anything else?
40455 := Thank you once again, human. And as I said earlier, don't worry about the bodies. I will take care of them for you.
40456 := Poor Ixgil. He should never have talked back to that Sith. Thankfully you were here to step in and help us, human.
40457 := This isn't the first time the Sith have come in here to cause trouble for us, but hopefully it will be the last.
40458 := Forgive me, human. I only wanted to thank you, I meant no harm. I will leave you in peace.
40459 := Don't worry about the bodies. I will move them so it looks like they were killed elsewhere. That should throw the Sith off the track.
40460 := With any luck, they won't be bothering us again for a while.
40461 := Stay out of my way or I'll kill you, too!
40462 := I'm just glad I could help.
40463 := Won't someone come searching for this patrol?
40464 := Okay you alien scum, everybody get up against the wall! This is a raid!
40465 := There was a patrol here just yesterday, and they found nothing! Why do you Sith keep bothering us?
40466 := That's how we Sith deal with smart-mouth aliens! Now the rest of you get up against the wall before I lose my temper again!
40467 := He'll take those aliens away for torture and questioning if we don't do something!
40468 := I think it's too late for that.
40469 := Hey, what's this? Humans hiding out with aliens?
40470 := They're Republic fugitives! Attack!

40539 := This is... strange. Such visions are often a sign of Force sensitivity.
40540 := I... I'm not sure. It may be that you have some connection to the Force. It would not be unheard of. When we first met, your natural talent may have fed off my own Force abilities.
40541 := It is possible that in the excitement of the battle's aftermath the Force allowed you to witness one of my more intense memories.
40542 := The Force is complicated; even I with all my training cannot fully understand it yet. This is a matter best left to the wise Masters of the Jedi Council.
40543 := Once we escape Taris we can seek the guidance of the Council, if you wish. They will understand the significance of your vision... if there is any.

40625 := Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio
By Gilthos Uksaris
(A work in progress)

The origins of what would eventually become the most famous band in the galaxy are surprisingly humble. The brains behind the group, manager Gilthos Uksaris, founded the Trio to earn a date with a young singer named Elinda.

The ploy worked, and Elinda became the first member of the band. Gilthos scrambled to find musicians to back her, and signed a Bith named Ujaa to be the lead musician. Soon after that he signed Ujaa's brother Ujii to complete the trio.

The band struggled at first. Elinda was a fantastic singer, but Ujaa wasn't much of a musician. When Elinda threatened to quit, Gilthos fired Ujaa and signed another Bith named Loopa.

Of course this didn't go over well with Ujaa's brother, and Ujii quit. Fortunately, Loopa knew another musician named Fodo, who joined to replace Ujii.

Led by Elinda's singing, the second incarnation of The Twisted Rancor Trio became quite popular on their home world of Taris, eventually attracting the attention of local legitimate businessman Davik Kang.

Davik asked Gilthos to bring his group in for a command performance. Gilthos agreed, realizing this could be the band's big break.  Unfortunately, Elinda had heard certain unsubstantiated rumors about Davik Kang and his connections to the Exchange. Fearing for her life, she refused to go to his estate to perform.

Many felt that without Elinda's singing the band would crumble. But Gilthos came up with a brilliant plan to save the group by hiring Elinda's sister, Ashana, as the new lead singer on the eve of their scheduled appearance at Davik's estate. 

Gilthos knew he was taking a risk. If Ashana couldn't perform at Elinda's level, Davik's infamous temper could have dire consequences for the entire band. However, if Ashana could match her sister's performance then Davik was likely to sign the band to a big time touring contract.

It was a risk, but The Twisted Rancor Trio was founded on "Guts and Glory".

40633 := Back again? Don't you get it? I'm working here. For you, dancing is probably just a fun way to pass the time, but this is serious business for me! So why do you keep bugging me?
40634 := If you want to help Lyn out, go talk to her. Otherwise, leave me alone. It's bad enough she's dancing solo - I can't concentrate on her dancing with you yapping in my ear!
40635 := You again? Shoo! Shoo! Look, I'm trying to work here, so off you go.
40636 := Forgotten me already, have you? Well, you're self-centered enough to be a performer. All you're lacking is the talent - like about ninety percent of the people who audition for me.
40637 := Bib Surool, manager of the Starlight Entertainers. Any of this sound familiar? I came here looking for dancers, but all I've found is a Twi'lek who doesn't have a partner.
40638 := What? Why are you bothering me? Can't you see I'm auditioning a dancer? Or at least, I'm trying to audition her. Not much point if she doesn't have a partner.
40639 := Okay, great. Bye-bye. Off you go.
40640 := Oh-ho! You think throwing a tantrum is going to impress me? Sorry - I manage two dozen dancers, musicians and other performers. I see more tantrums in one day than most people in a year!
40641 := Name's Bib Surool, manager for the Starlight Entertainers: the top performing troupe in this sector of the galaxy. I was here scouting new talent when the Sith attacked, and now I can't leave.
40642 := You'd think the Sith would let me go so I could get back to my troupe, but I guess they just don't appreciate the arts. So, since I'm stuck here, I figured I might as well continue with my auditions.
40643 := I'm supposed to be auditioning Lyn, but I think I'm wasting my time. Lyn's got all the moves, but I need to know if she can pull them off while sharing a stage with her partner.
40644 := She doesn't have one. That's the problem. Aren't you listening to me? Dancers don't perform solo, so I need to see if she can work with someone else before I get her up on stage.
40645 := I doubt she just wants to dance with someone who wandered by. This is her one shot at the big time, and dancing with some wanna-be as her partner isn't going to help her cause.
40646 := On the other hand, I'm not going to hire her unless I can see her in action with a partner. Maybe she's desperate enough to give you a chance. You'd have to ask her, I guess.
40647 := I want to dance as Lyn's partner.
40648 := Who are you again?
40649 := I'll be going now.
40650 := I don't like your tone!
40651 := Who are you?
40652 := What are you talking about?
40653 := I don't have time for this.
40654 := Where's her partner?
40655 := Maybe I could help her out.
40656 := [This musician is too busy playing to pay any attention to you.]
40657 := Just tell her Canderous sent you and she'll sell you the droid. Then you can use it to get the launch codes from the Sith base.
40658 := Normally I'd do this myself, but everyone knows who I work for. If I broke into the Sith base, they'd send an army down on Davik's estate to get those codes back. That's why I need you.
40659 := Davik paid for the droid, but I'm the guy he put in charge of this mission. He won't care how I come up with those codes.
40660 := Just tell her Canderous sent you and she'll sell you the droid. Then you can use it to get the launch codes from the Sith base.
40661 := Normally I'd do this myself, but everyone knows who I work for. If I broke into the Sith base, they'd send an army down on Davik's estate to get those codes back. That's why I need you.
40662 := Davik paid for the droid, but I'm the guy he put in charge of this mission. He won't care how I come up with those codes.
40663 := Why don't you do this yourself?
40664 := Won't Davik get mad if I take his droid?
40665 := Why don't you do this yourself?
40666 := Won't Davik be mad if I take his droid?

[Press <abutton> to go to PARTY SELECTION screen.]
40668 := Yeah, right. Sounds to me like she was defending herself.
40669 := Back again? Dancing isn't easy, you know. It requires focus and concentration. You can't keep bothering me like this.
40670 := It's hard enough for me to impress Bib without showing him how I dance with a partner. I don't need any distractions to make it worse. 
40671 := Can't you see I'm auditioning? This is my shot at the big time; I can't risk screwing it up by talking to you.
40672 := Ah, what's the use? There's no way Bib's going to hire me unless he gets a chance to see me dancing with a partner. Maybe I should just give up.
40673 := Oh, okay. I guess I'll just go back to auditioning. Don't see much point without a partner, though.
40674 := That Twi'lek over there is Bib Surool, the manager and talent scout for the Starlight Entertainers. They're one of the biggest performing troupes in this quadrant.
40675 := When I heard he was stuck on Taris, I figured it was my lucky break. If I can impress him he might hire me on as a dancer and I can finally get off this slime-pit of a world.
40676 := But I don't have a partner, and the Starlight Entertainers never perform solo. If he can't judge how I dance with someone else, I'm sunk.
40677 := My last partner left me. She was always trying to upstage me, even though it was obvious I had ten times her talent. When I finally told her that, she stormed off. I guess the truth hurts.
40678 := My partner before that was even worse. If I wasn't tripping over his staggering feet I was ducking under his flailing arms. I ditched him after less than a week.
40679 := Is that a joke? I'm a professional entertainer, I don't pay people to dance with me! Besides, who says I'm looking for a partner anyway?
40680 := I admit I'm getting desperate: I'd hate to blow this audition. But I don't know if I'm ready to just pair up with a random passer-by. How do I know you're any good?
40681 := [Failure] You know what, I think I have a better chance going solo than I do with you stumbling around beside me. I'll pass.
40682 := [Success] Well, you do have that certain look about you: a confidence of movement. *sigh* I guess you'll have to do. But I'm warning you - don't screw this up!
40683 := Mr. Surool, I've got a partner now. I'd really like to audition for you again.
40684 := Okay, Lyn, you've got one more chance. I'll give you a minute to get your partner set up, then let's see what you've got.
40685 := Okay, I've got time to watch you for three more dances. Make them count.
40686 := Okay, just follow my lead. Remember, the more complicated our steps and the closer we dance the more it will impress Bib. 
40687 := But don't get in too close if you can't handle it. I don't need some clumsy oaf tripping me up. Try not to screw this up for me, okay?
40688 := Wow, very impressive. Good technique, good rhythm, good synchronization, nice tight spacing. Are you sure your partner's an amateur, Lyn?
40689 := Hey - quit trying to upstage me! This is my audition, not yours!
40690 := Now listen, we made a good first impression so you might want to take it down a notch for the next dance just so you don't do anything stupid. Just follow my lead again.
40691 := What was that? That was easily the stupidest thing I've ever seen!
40692 := I'm not auditioning for a comedy act, here! I want dancers, not clowns. Come on, Lyn - pull it together. One last chance. Let's go.
40693 := You idiot! What were you thinking? I'd have a better chance dancing with a drunken Gammorean! You're going to ruin me!
40694 := Look, we've only got one dance left and we're going to have to pull out all the stops. Don't hold anything back this time. So pay attention to my moves, then join in and don't screw up!
40695 := I've seen enough. Sorry, Lyn, but you're not what the Starlight Entertainers are looking for. You've got nice moves, kid, but you don't do too well with a partner.
40696 := You did that on purpose! Nobody could be that bad a dancer unless they were trying! You've wrecked my one shot at the big time!
40697 := Damn you and your big, flapping feet!
40698 := Bib - wait! Let me try again, Bib. I can get another partner! A good partner. Bib - wait up.
40699 := Well sorry doesn't get me a job with the Starlight Dancers, does it?
40700 := No, no, no! Dance while you're standing up! It's a novel concept, I know, but give it a shot!
40701 := You just had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't manage this one last dance without screwing up, could you?
40702 := Don't judge me on that last dance, Bib. Please, give me another chance. Let me try one more.
40703 := Looking good. Looking very good. Feel the music. Let it flow through you.
40704 := Well, what did you think? Do I get the job? Do you want me to dance some more? I can do another one for you if you want.
40705 := Relax, Lyn. You made it. You've got the job. Welcome to the Starlight Entertainers.
40706 := I made it? I really made it? This is incredible.  I... I don't believe it!
40707 := Believe it, kid. You're in. Now we need to get you fitted for your outfits, we need to start rehearsels, you've got contracts to sign. Let's go. Busy, busy. That's the life of a star.
40708 := Thank you. I couldn't have made it without you. I'd give you a big hug, but... well, frankly you're a little beneath me now. Like Bib said, I'm going to be a star!
40709 := But if you're ever traveling the galaxy and you see the Starlight Entertainers performing, stop by and ask for Lyn. I'll see if I can get you some free tickets.
40710 := Good, good. One, two, three, one, two, three... nice tempo. Looking good, Lyn. Okay, one more dance to go.
40711 := Okay, one dance to go. Bib looks happy. As long as we don't screw up I think we've got it! Follow me and please, just keep it simple.
40712 := Very nice, Lyn. You know, your partner isn't too bad... for an amateur. Okay, let's see what else you've got.
40713 := Okay, we're off to a good start. Like Bib said, you're not bad for an amateur. This next dance is a little different, so watch me for the pick-ups and follow my lead. 
40714 := Here's some helpful advice: for your next dance, try not to fall over.
40715 := What are you doing? Are you trying to cost me my one shot at fame and fortune? You have to concentrate!
40716 := Hmmm. Simple, but nice. Just remember: the Starlight Entertainers don't want simple. We're only looking for the top performers in the galaxy.
40717 := Look, I know you're trying to be careful about screwing up, but you've got to give me a little more than that. Bib's seen thousands of dancers: we need to do something that will impress him.
40718 := The next dance is a little different, so watch me for the steps then jump in.
40719 := [Failure] You think this is easy? I've trained for years to develop my talents. Dancing isn't just wiggling your butt in the air, you know! Well, except for the Corellian Cheek-Step.
40720 := If you think you can just step up and start dancing at a professional level, you better think again.
40721 := I'll be going now.
40722 := What are you talking about?
40723 := Why don't you have a partner?
40724 := I'll partner up with you, for a price.
40725 := Maybe I could be your partner.
40726 := You're right. I can't dance. Nevermind.
40727 := [Persuade] What other choice do you have?
40728 := [Persuade] I'm good enough to get you through your audition.

40735 := [Join Lyn by dancing very close and face to face.]
40736 := [Join Lyn by dancing beside her.]

40741 := [Persuade] How hard can it be?
40742 := You showed a lot of guts dealing with those Vulkars, kid. You got a name?
40743 := Actually, now that I think of it that bounty's no longer on the table. Davik told me Largo's bounty is off the table. I guess the merchant came up with the credits. Don't bother with that one anymore, human.
40744 := Okay, I don't know about Davik's special contracts. Justice is one thing, but doing a crime lord's dirty work is something else.
40745 := I can't see anything wrong with getting rid of people like that - as long as we don't end up on the list of their victims.
40746 := [Failure] Sorry, human.  If you get a break on the price then I have to give everyone a deal. I won't let you whittle my prices down! If you can't pay, then I won't talk.
40747 := Okay, human. What do you want to know?

40857 := You must be careful as you do this, human. If you set all the panels to the green "on" position my cell's termination program will engage and I will be executed. 
40858 := How do I release you, again?
40859 := Sorry, I don't remember who you are.
40860 := Right. I remember you.
40861 := I think I'll just leave you there.
40862 := Forget it.
40863 := Fine, I'll help you.

40905 := This nothing but wanton greed and cruelty! Beware, lest these things lead you to the dark side.
40906 := I do not approve of this. This is not how a Jedi should behave.
40907 := I know Jawas don't have the best reputation, but that doesn't mean we can just treat them like this!
40908 := Hey, why are you being so mean to this little guy? What did he ever do to you?
40909 := Oh, I get it. He's small and helpless so we can just do whatever we want, right? Sometimes I just don't know about you, kid.
40910 := Request: Let me deal with him, master. It would be so much fun!
40911 := That's the way - squeeze that little guy for every credit he's got!
40912 := Don't you believe a word of what Czerka Corporation said in there, there is always a peaceful solution to conflict. They are just lazy.
40913 := I'm sure you do. Czerka probably hired you to kill the Sand People in retaliation for a few attacks. Just another bloodthirsty fool.
40914 := The Sand People aren't animals. I've watched them, and they are intelligent. There must be a way to peacefully stop the attacks... I know it.
40915 := But no one will try, of course. You can't even leave the city without Czerka approval and they want the Sand People dead.
40916 := Perhaps I'm no expert on diplomatic situations, but I know when there is a lack of due care for the evironment and the residents of it.
40917 := Yes they have, but Czerka Corporation deployed numerous giant sandcrawlers to tear up the desert with ion shovels and whatever else.
40918 := Well, yes they did. They attacked the Czerka, who deployed numerous giant sandcrawlers and started tearing up the desert with ion shovels and whatever else.
40919 := What would you have done? To the Sand People, it must have seemed like an invasion. There were no negotiations for territory or resources.
40920 := I don't think the killing has been justified, but as a conservationist I'm hoping someone at least tries to talk this out.
40921 := Go on then, but you're just like the Czerka. Shortsighted fool. If you could just talk to them... maybe get a true translation droid...
40922 := Ah, I'm wasting my time. Go on, get out of here.
40923 := That's what the infuriating Czerka Protocol officer said, but I'm not foolish enough to believe it. Everyone just wants to wipe the Sand People out.
40924 := Well, there is the small matter that they don't seem to speak a language that your average translator can understand. Is that their fault?
40925 := There was even a Jedi here a few years ago that couldn't seem to get through to them. I... think that ended in blood too.
40926 := I'm not saying it would be easy, but someone has to try. Maybe with a real translation droid, not these old protocol scrap heaps walking around.
40927 := Someone else has to! I've got no influence with Czerka Corporation, I can't afford what Yuka Laka charges for his droids, and I wouldn't survive...
40928 := Well, what I mean is, whoever tries to deal with the Sand People would first have to survive their initial attacks. I wouldn't.
40929 := Someone could maybe get into their enclave if they could disguise themselves, but you'd have to get real desert robes and that would be dangerous too.
40930 := They are pretty rare, even on well-stocked worlds, but I'm sure I heard something about an unusual droid in the shop here on Tatooine. 
40931 := Well, *you* do, don't you? You bought that strange old droid off of Yuka Laka, didn't you? He said it was quite sophisticated.
40932 := I'm sure I heard Yuka Laka say that it could speak a Sand People dialect. Although he'd say rust is gold to make a sale...
40933 := With that droid, maybe you could talk to them. I wouldn't survive... maybe with desert robes as a disguise someone could get into their enclave.
40934 := Sure, that's what Czerka Corporation keeps saying, and then they just start shooting again. The fighting won't stop until they are all dead.
40935 := Or until the Czerka leave. The one is as likely as the other with the way things are going. Bah, what do I know.
40936 := I suppose you could take them off of the warrior raiders in the Dune Sea, but there's no way I'd survive anything like that.
40937 := Plus you would have to explain why you killed their warriors if you are trying to make peace... but I suppose there is no other way.
40938 := What? It's no secret where they are. The attacks get worse the further southwest in the Dune Sea you go. Then people die on both sides.
40939 := Communication. If we could just speak to them... but they don't talk. At least, not in any language an average translator can understand.
40940 := So, you are the killer that they hired. Just going to walk out there and wipe them out? I'd expect no less from fools.
40941 := Czerka miners have been attacked by Sand People, so the company Czerka Corporation wants them killed. They didn't ask you to do it?
40942 := Move aside, I have things to do.
40943 := Why would you know any better?
40944 := Intelligent or not, the Sand People have killed people.
40945 := The Czerka said that the Sand People attacked first.
40946 := I don't care. Get out of my way.
40947 := I will deal with the matter as I see fit.
40948 := Why hasn't anyone tried talking to them?
40949 := Why don't *you* do something? Why should I?
40950 := Who would have a capable droid?
40951 := Maybe I'll look into it.
40952 := Where would you get robes to match theirs?
40953 := Where would that enclave you mentioned be?
40954 := What would you suggest, then?
40955 := Is this about Czerka wanting the Sand People chieftain killed?
40956 := What do you mean? What are you talking about?
40957 := You! You're the one! You beat Zoriis Bafka's time? I have to get your autoprint.
40958 := No? Why not? I just wanted to get a mark from the best new racer on the circuit. What is wrong with that?
40959 := If you are so full of yourself now, I would hate to see what you would be like if the pro tour was back up. Keep your print, then.
40960 := Sure I am! You are fast for a human, and once the races are running regular again, you'll be famous. Well, maybe you will.
40961 := If you start winning on the real tour, I want to be able to say I saw you when you were just starting out. How about it?
40962 := Really? That is great of you. You will be a fan favorite. Some of the racers sell their prints, but that is just rude.
40963 := Here, just put your hand on this pad. Thanks again. I know I'll be seeing more of you, human.
40964 := Go away, I don't have time for you.
40965 := What? My autoprint? Are you serious?
40966 := Sure, why not? Scan away.
40967 := We scavenge for everyone, but Giants of Sand never trade fair.
40968 := You come, you go, we scavenge, you come back, you go, we scavenge.
40969 := There are many of us, but not where you can see.
40970 := We will remember you when you are sand too. 
40971 := Sand stays. All else changes.
40972 := We trade and scavenge when people will buy. Not so good now.
40973 := Giants in the Sand will be here long after you. So will Jawa.
40974 := Trade is small now. You will all be gone soon.
40975 := There won't be many of my kind coming here. You don't need extra senses to see this place won't last.
40976 := There's little reason for my kind to come here. It's dry enough, but there are no more credits to be made.
40977 := It is too bad this outpost won't last. Czerka is not providing reasons for new business to come here.
40978 := The deserts agree with me. If I want water, I'll go to the cantina.
40979 := It's safe and dry in the walls of Anchorhead, but very few credits going around.
40980 := I see eye to eye with Jawas, but the smell is beyond what four nostrils can bear.
40981 := Dry winds carry the smell of battle. Sandcrawlers burn out on the desert.
40982 := Little water here. We like that in a world. Safety of a sort.

41015 := [Success] [Komad squints, sensing your influence but not being able to fight it. He seems saddened by your action, as though he expected better.]

41018 := [Force Persuade] You aren't worth my time. Leave.
41019 := Hello again. What can I do for you? As I must have said, I'm no hunter like the others here.
41020 := Ah, welcome back. Would you care for another game? Very few of my old playing buddies come this way.
41021 := Well, nice to see you again. Would you like another game? You've proven your skill, and I like being challenged.
41022 := Well, I have to say that you have proven a masterful player. I have to reward you, if only for the sport you have given me.
41023 := Credits are such a hollow prize for good playing... here, you've earned this. It's a trinket that I won in the Dantooine sector.
41024 := Don't taint your win with that attitude. I take no offence, but if the prize is all you want, any losses will be horrible to bear.
41025 := It is, after all, just a game.
41026 := I'd hoped so. You play well, and should keep at it. Now, is there anything else you need?
41027 := Very good! You played quite well on that hand. I am impressed. I don't mind losing when the game was skillfully won.
41028 := You are shaping up to be a fine competitor. I hope you keep playing and begin to see the long-term rewards of the game like I do.
41029 := Obviously you have some ability, and I am glad for the competition. We could play some more and perhaps later we could raise the stakes.
41030 := I shouldn't be surprised. After all, you have proven your skill many time over by now. It's a pleasure to play you.
41031 := Well, that's a bit of hard luck, friend. Sorry about your loss. It was good sport though, wasn't it?
41032 := A bad hand or just a misplayed card or two, I guess. I'm sure you'll make up for it. You've beaten me before.
41033 := A surprising outcome considering how well you've done in the past. You're capable of far better.
41034 := I don't want you to get jaded about your performance. I see a lot of players quit too soon. It's your choice, of course.
41035 := Hello human. Are you a hunter like the others here? Not the life for me, but I admire you for it.
41036 := Safe travels, wayfarer.
41037 := Nothing since that unfortunate business on Taris. The Republic is reeling from that, as are we all. It is troubling.
41038 := But you can't let that call a stop to your day. We've survived worse, and will again. It's just the way things are.
41039 := Oh, I doubt I could tell you more than the rest of these fellows. I haven't set foot outside Anchorhead, and I don't know why anyone would want to.
41040 := Tatooine isn't a very hospitable place. I'll be going as soon as parts for my ship arrive. It may take some time, though.
41041 := What did you want to talk about? Would you care for a game?
41042 := Well, I suppose we could play a practice hand to help you get a feel for the game.
41043 := It's heady reading, perhaps, but it explains all you need to know.
41044 := I fill the days with games of Pazaak. Not that there's many people to play with, but a person should keep busy somehow.
41045 := I'd play with that fellow in the cantina, but I find him... distasteful. He does not play for the same reasons I do.
41046 := Very well. I have little else to do.
41047 := I couldn't say, though I suppose there might be one for sale in the cantina. There's a player in there that likes to take new money.
41048 := He quits as soon as it's clear he'll lose big. I prefer honest competition, but I suppose I don't have to worry about money as much as some.
41049 := You did well last time. I'm glad I found someone to offer decent competition here. There's not much else here to interest me.
41050 := I'm glad your loss has not soured you on the game. You've won before, and you likely will again. I like the challenge.
41051 := Feel free to bet an interesting amount. It can add to the thrill of the game.
41052 := We'll make this for moderate stakes, just to keep it interesting.
41053 := Bet what you wish. I prefer the sport to the reward.
41054 := We'll do another round like before. You made a good showing last time, and I like to keep things friendly.
41055 := Very well. I admire that you would return to the game after your initial bad luck. Let's keep wagers low until your luck changes.
41056 := I'm up for it. I haven't played you before so let's go slow to start. Low wagers, just to see how we measure up.
41057 := Well, I'm glad you still want to play. You're good and I enjoy the challenge. It's the best use of my time on this planet.
41058 := The sport of it! Even if I lose there is reward in having played to the best of my ability. I don't dwell on the credits taken or given.
41059 := To most people the game is simply gambling, but I choose to get more out of it than that. Not may players see it my way.
41060 := It's about time there was a decent payout.
41061 := Thanks. I appreciate it.
41062 := I have to go. Goodbye.
41063 := Heard any rumors from off-planet?
41064 := Could I ask you about Tatooine?

41067 := What do you do?
41068 := Let's go back to my other questions.

41070 := Let's have a game.

41094 := [Force Persuade] I'm tired of your voice, old man. Be *quiet.*

41100 := *whisper* I don't know much about the Jedi code, but I know I'd rather see those credits in our hands than in the hands of Czerka Corp or the Sith.
41101 := *whisper* A Jedi shoud not use the Force to acquire credits - even if we are taking them from a corrupt corporation like Czerka.
41102 := *whisper* Czerka may be a corrupt organization, but that doesn't justify us using the Force for personal gain.
41103 := *whisper* Nicely done, kid. Those extra credits could come in handy on our little search. Besides, it's not like Czerka Corp. can't afford it.
41104 := You'll be hearing about this, you Czerka puppet! I'm not going to let this drop! You can't just murder a whole village!
41105 := And don't tell me to take my concerns to your corporate kiosk! I know when I'm not wanted!
41106 := I'm done talking in this office. They aren't interested in listening to me. I doubt they will even acknowledge I was here.

41175 := Observation: There is tremendous power emanating from the Star Map. I wonder if the krayt dragon was drawn to this cave because of it?

41178 := Finding this Star Map here in this cave gives me a cold shiver. You don't think it's just coincidence that the krayt dragon made its home here, do you?
41179 := Hey - it's one of those Star Maps, ain't it? Kind of weird finding it in the back of a krayt dragon's lair, don't you think?
41180 := Say, now that we've got the Star Map do you think we can leave this planet soon? I've got sand *everywhere*!
41181 := Anybody else get the feeling that finding this Star Map in the back of this krayt dragon's cave is more than just a coincidence?
41182 := Now that we've got what we came for we should probably move on. Can't say I'm going to miss this pit of a world.
41183 := Anyone else get the feeling that finding this Star Map in the back of this krayt dragon's cave is more than just a coincidence?
41184 := We should probably get going now. We've found the Star Map, and I'm guessing there isn't much else worth seeing on this planet.
41185 := The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The krayt dragon may have been drawn here by its dark power, only to be enslaved by it.
41186 := Well, no point hanging around here. Now that we've got the Star Map we might as well move on.
41187 := The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The krayt dragon may have been drawn here by its dark power, only to be enslaved by it.
41188 := Come. We should leave this place. There is nothing else for us here.
41189 := The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The krayt dragon may have been drawn here by its dark power, only to be enslaved by it.
41190 := Come. We should leave this place. There is nothing else for us here.
41191 := I agree. It's amazing the Star Map is still working after all these years.
41192 := You're right. Let's get moving.
41193 := It's probably just coincidence.
41194 := Possibly. The Star Map is a powerful dark side artifact.
41195 := This holocron has been cracked and worn by the sands and wind, but is still marginally operational. When activated, it shows the holographic image of a middle-aged human man and appears to have been used as a means to record his personal thoughts over many years.

41381 := You can't be certain, but this may be some sort of pictorial history of the Rakatan species.

41848 := Good race, Sector Champion. I guess you'll be off to the big tracks, once the circuit is back up.
41849 := Wow, I bet you could have won on Taris with times like that. It's a shame we'll never know.
41850 := Could I get an autoprint? You've just had the quickest rise to Sector Champion that I've ever seen.
41851 := It's amazing what you've accomplished here, and you've done it with such style. I've never met a woman like you.
41852 := You sure put Hukta in his place. I don't have to say that you are a much more appealing champion.

41885 := Each of your character's skills has a number associated with it. This is the skill 'rank' and determines how good the character is with that skill. When using a skill to perform an action, the rank is compared against a Difficulty Check (DC) number. For example, to open a lock with a DC of 15, take your skill rank in Security + Wisdom modifier +d20 roll. If the total is 15 or greater, the lock is opened.

42082 := Bastila has been captured by Darth Malak, your old apprentice.
42083 := Malak has turned Bastila to the dark side. You confronted her atop the Rakatan Temple, but she escaped. No doubt she has fled to the Star Forge.
42084 := Through your actions you have redeemed Bastila and brought her back to the light, just as you yourself were redemeed from your life as Darth Revan.
42085 := You have returned to the dark side and embraced your old life. Bastila has joined you so that together you can reclaim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith from Malak, your old apprentice.
42086 := You experienced a powerful vision upon first meeting Bastila. The vision could be an indication that you have a strong connection with the Force, but Bastila was reluctant to speculate on such matters.
42087 := Bastila has told you she sees signs that the Force is acting through you. However, she was reluctant to speculate further, feeling such matters are the providence of the Jedi Council.
42088 := Because of the bond you and Bastila share, she is extremely interested in learning more about your character. However, you get the sense there is something she isn't telling you.
42089 := Bastila seems to have taken the role of teacher upon herself, choosing to lecture you about the evils of the dark side. Understandable, considering the bond the two of you share.
42090 := In order to prepare you for your meeting with Darth Malak, Bastila described her own encounter with the Sith Lord Revan. According to Bastila, the Jedi wanted to capture Revan alive but were foiled when Malak betrayed his own master.
42091 := Bastila told you something of her life before the Jedi. She was very adamant in her support of the Jedi's policy of severing all familial relationships, as emotional attachments are inherently dangerous to a Jedi.
42092 := Apparently Bastila is still playing the role of mentor. She has been studying your progress carefully, and had much to say about your actions and the perils of the dark side.
42093 := You've asked Bastila why the Jedi Council sent the two of you - neither fully trained - on this dangerous mission. Based on her answer, Bastila either has blind faith in the Council or she simply prefers to avoid the question.
42094 := Bastila has apologized to you for her earlier attitude, and has admitted how much she respects and admires you as a person and a Jedi. Whether this will change anything between you remains to be seen.
42095 := Bastila is having doubts about her own abilities as a Jedi. Hopefully her uncertainty won't work against the mission... or lead her down the path of the dark side.
42096 := Bastila's doubts about her own abilites continue to grow. She is actually afraid she may now be a detriment to your development as a Jedi.
42097 := You may want to try talking to Bastila again a little later. She might be more willing to talk at the next planet or once you are more experienced.
42098 := Bastila wants to talk to you... but in privacy, away from the others. Speak to her again when you have returned to the Ebon Hawk.
42099 := There's nothing more that needs to be said at the moment. Your relationship with Bastila is going to depend on the outcome of this mission, and perhaps once it is over with the two of you can look at what it is going to become. For now, however, the mission is more important... as is your destiny.
42100 := There is nothing more to talk about with Bastila, at least for the time being.
42101 := Bastila is lost to the dark side, and there was nothing you could do to convince her to return to the way of the light.
42102 := Carth's revenge is complete, Saul Karath is dead. What Carth will do now is anyone's guess.
42103 := You've discovered that Carth's home world was attacked by the Sith, though he was reluctant to talk about it. Perhaps you can talk more later, after you've gained more experience. 
42104 := Although he has agreed to work with you, you've learned that Carth is suspicious and mistrustful of others. There is probably a reason behind his mistrust, but he was reluctant to discuss it.
42105 := Despite being impressed with your abilities, Carth is still not willing to fully open up to you. Maybe if you give him some time he'll finally learn to trust you.
42106 := It's obvious Carth is emotionally scarred by the betrayals of friends and allies at the start of the Sith war. There's probably more to the story, but he doesn't want to discuss it right now.
42107 := You've learned that Carth's mentor, Saul Karath, was one of the first to defect to the Sith cause. It's no wonder Carth has trust issues, though he seems reluctant to talk about it right now.
42108 := Carth feels like he's being left out of the loop where the Jedi Council and Bastila are concerned. Because of the betrayals in his past, he's not reacting to the situation well. Hopefully in time he'll learn to cope with his emotional demons.
42109 := Carth has apologized for his previous behavior, and has promised to try not to punish his current companions for the betrayals of people in his past. Whether he can accomplish this remains to be seen.
42110 := You've learned that Carth's wife and son were lost when Saul Karath led the Sith fleet against Carth's homeworld, making him swear vengeance on the man he once admired. Whether he will ever get a chance to make good on his oath remains to be seen.
42111 := You've learned that Carth's wife and son were lost when Saul Karath led the Sith fleet against Carth's homeworld, making him swear vengeance on the man he once admired. Whether he will ever get a chance to make good on his oath remains to be seen.
42112 := Carth is worried about you and Bastila. He's afraid the temptation of the dark side might destroy you both. He could be right... or he could just be a typically over-protective male.
42113 := Once again Carth has vowed to kill Saul Karath for his betrayal. Hopefully Carth's desire for revenge won't jeopardize the mission.
42114 := Carth has admitted he expects his vengeance against Saul to result in both their deaths. He hasn't even thought about what he will do next if he kills Saul and somehow manages to survive.
42115 := It seems you've finally won Carth's full trust, though it wasn't easy. How this will affect the mission, or your relationship with Carth, remains to be seen.
42116 := Carth is devastated after finding out who you truly are. Give him some time. Perhaps once the Star Maps have been found and the mission is nearer to its conclusion, you might want to try talking to him again.
42117 := There is nothing more that remains to be said. Whatever becomes of you and Carth will have to be determined once your destiny is resolved... one way or the other.
42118 := Carth and you have nothing more to talk about, for the moment.

42533 := This page lists your character's skills. Each skill has a number associated with it. This is the skill 'rank' and determines how good the character is with that skill. When using a skill to perform an action, the rank is compared against a Difficulty Check (DC) number. For example, to open a lock with a DC of 15, take your skill rank in Security + Wisdom modifier +d20 roll. If the total is 15 or greater, the lock is opened.
42534 := This page lists your feats. Some feats allow you to use special items like heavy armor or implants. Other feats modify saving throws and skill checks during the game. And some feats (POWER ATTACK) are used during combat. Check the description for details on a specific feat.
42535 := This page lists your Force Powers. Using a Force Power requires Force Points. Your light/dark side rating affects the Force point cost of some powers.

42637 := [Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 3 seconds and has gained an additional +2 bonus to his dexterity.]
42638 := [Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 6 seconds, in addition to his other abilities.]
42639 := [Because of your repairs, HK-47 now has a permanent bonus of +2 to his defense rating, in addition to the +2 dexterity bonus from your earlier repairs.]
42640 := [Because of your repairs, HK-47 now has a permanent bonus of +2 to his dexterity.]
42641 := [This man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.]
42642 := [The old man knows better than to engage in chit-chat with enemies so close by.]
42643 := I agree with you. They destroyed my mind, after all.
42644 := The Jedi are always fair and merciful. They gave me a second chance.
42645 := Sounds familiar. Seems like the Jedi don't like killing their helpless enemies.
42646 := So you disobeyed the Council. Like I did.
42647 := Sort of like Revan. I mean me. I assume he was killed?
42648 := Are these Sith the same as the ones who followed me?
42649 := [This man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.]
42650 := [With enemies in sight, Juhani's Cathar blood is boiling. She is in no mood to speak right now.]
42651 := [This twi'lek appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.]
42652 := She's here on Tatooine, dear. In the cantina. You really should go see her, considering her condition.
42653 := [This woman appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.]
42654 := We're too busy for this nonsense, Bastila!
42655 := I guess we should go see your mother, Bastila.
42656 := [With enemies nearby, this might not be the best time to talk to Mission.]
42657 := I just wanted to talk. About me being Revan.
42658 := So it doesn't bother you at all?
42659 := Forgive me for the intrusion, human. My name is Senni Vek. I believe you dropped this datapad and I wish to return it to you.
42660 := My pleasure, human. You should examine it to make sure it is not broken.
42661 := Goodbye, human.
42662 := No, this is no game. I simply saw you drop this datapad and I wish to give it back to you.
42663 := There is no mistake, human. This datapad is yours and yours alone. Please, take it.
42664 := I'm certain you did, human. Please, take the datapad. It's yours, I'm sure.
42665 := Are you certain, human? Please, take the datapad.
42666 := Very well, human. I will keep the datapad and I will leave. Goodbye, human.
42667 := Uh... thanks.
42668 := What is this, some kind of con game?
42669 := I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.
42670 := I didn't drop anything.
42671 := I don't want it.
42672 := I'll beat you to death with that datapad if you don't go away right now!
42673 := No. It's not mine. I won't take it.
42674 := Fine. Give me the stupid datapad!
42675 := [With enemies this nearby, T3 is more interested in engaging his combat protocol than in speaking with you.]
42676 := [This unsavory looking man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.]
42677 := You rescued me from the Gammorean slavers. It does not matter to me if you are called <FullName> or Revan: I have sworn a life debt to you.
42678 := I will stay with you to the end, <FullName>. And I will judge you on your actions as I see them, not on a history I have never known.
42679 := [Focused on the nearby enemy, Zaalbar is in no mood to talk right now.]
42680 := How do you feel about me being Revan?
42681 := Greetings, human. A word, if I may. It concerns the Dark Lord of the Sith.
42682 := Please, human - this is of importance to us both! I know who you are... Revan!
42683 := You are what you are, human. You cannot deny that you were once the Lord of the Sith. And you cannot deny that you wish to defeat Malak!
42684 := Your secret is safe with me, Lord Revan. At least until you chose to reveal yourself. But I have come here with an offer of aid. I want to help you defeat your old apprentice.
42685 := Listen to me, and all will be made clear. My name is Ziagrom. I am a... a businessman. I and my partner deal in rare items of extraordinary value and power.
42686 := No, we are not. We are independant operators, though often our transactions involve those who represent the Exchange. 
42687 := Traditionally, we have always done business with the owner of the Ebon Hawk: Davik Kang, most recently. Ahita Othar before him. Forii Haxa before her. But we were reluctant to approach you.
42688 := You had no ties to the Exchange, which was a problem. Even worse, you were a Jedi! Not the sort of person we normally associate with.
42689 := There were reports of the Ebon Hawk traveling to many different planets. We wanted to know what you were up to. At your last port, I placed a small tracking device on your ship.
42690 := The tracking device reported back to us that you had been captured by the Leviathan. Once we had that information, we began digging into our sources within the Sith fleet.
42691 := Your escapades on the Leviathan created quite a stir in the Sith fleet. Of course Malak tried to suppress the truth about your identity: there were more than a few summary executions.
42692 := But even if security footage is destroyed and witnesses silenced, some bits of information always slip through. Spend enough credits to gather the tiny pieces and the puzzle becomes clear.
42693 := We know what happened on the Leviathan. At least, we know enough. You are Darth Revan, and you are going to kill Malak for daring to claim dominion over the Sith.
42694 := Maybe, maybe not. But whatever your motivation may be, you *do* intend to stop Malak and his followers - of that we are sure. And we want to help. 
42695 := My partner and I deal in very rare and powerful items. Weapons, armor: things you could use in your battles against Malak and the Sith.
42696 := I don't carry these items with me, of course. They're with my partner. But they're yours, if you've got the credits to buy them. We do want to make a profit on this, after all.
42697 := Just go to the Dreshdae Cantina on Korriban. There's a Rodian in there named Mika Dorin. Tell Mika that Ziagrom sent you to look at the premium items.
42698 := It's up to you, I guess. But you'll be missing out on the best equipment in the galaxy! Sooner or later you'll realize this deal is to good to pass up.
42699 := Just go to the Cantina here in Dreshdae. There's a Rodian there named Mika Dorin. Tell Mika that Ziagrom sent you to look at the premium items.
42700 := Mika already knows to expect you. Like I said, just tell him you want to look at the premium items.
42701 := I guess my work here is done. Goodbye, Revan. And once Malak is beaten, don't forget who helped you to victory.
42702 := There are millions of soldiers in the Sith fleet. Surely you aren't surprised that some of them will sell information? Even high ranking officers aren't immune to the lure of easy credits.
42703 := Yes, human. I know. That is why I have approached you.
42704 := No, human. I mean the *true* Lord of the Sith. I am speaking of Darth Revan. Of you.
42705 := I don't have time for this!
42706 := I'm not Revan anymore.
42707 := If you tell anyone who I am, I'll kill you!
42708 := How do you know who I am?
42709 := Who are you?
42710 := You're with the Exchange!
42711 := So why are you approaching me now?
42712 := Get to the point - how do you know my true identity?
42713 := Go on.
42714 := You're wrong. I'm not in this for revenge.
42715 := How does this involve you?
42716 := Let me see these items.
42717 := And you're just going to give these items to me?
42718 := I can't be bothered with this.
42719 := I'll check it out next time on Korriban.
42720 := I'll go check it out.
42721 := Sources? What sources?
42722 := *I* am the Dark Lord of the Sith!
42723 := You mean Malak?
42724 := [You must gather your party before venturing forth.]
42725 := Dire Katarn
42726 := Kinrath Stalker
42727 := Fanatical Selkath
42728 := Senni Vek
42729 := Sith Grenadier
42730 := Sith Assault Trooper
42731 := Dire Tuk'ata
42732 := Shyrack Wyrm
42733 := Ziagrom
42734 := Qel-Droma Robes
42735 := The Force is strong in the Qel-Droma blood, and many of the family have joined the Jedi Order over the centuries. These robes were created as a gift for Cay Qel-Droma during the war against Exar Kun, and it is said that only one who truly walks the path of the light can wear them. Cay himself wore the robes in his duel against Ulic Qel-Droma, his brother who had fallen to the dark side. Cay was slain in the battle, but his death at his brother's hand eventual lead to Ulic's redemption. These powerful robes then passed down to Duron Qel-Droma, Cay's cousin, when he joined the Jedi. But Duron disappeared shortly after the time of the Great Hunt, and the robes were lost with him.
42736 := Darth Revan's Robes
42737 := Created by the mystical technology of the Star Forge, these robes focus the dark side energies of the wearer, fueling their power. The Sith Lord Darth Revan was wearing similar robes when captured by the Jedi, who viewed the garments as an abomination and destroyed them. However the Jedi Council, not being familiar with the origins of the robes, were unaware that the Star Forge would be capable of producing an item of such terrible power a second time.
42738 := Star Forge Robes
42739 := Created by the mystical technology of the Star Forge, these robes focus the inherent Force abilities of the wearer, fueling their power. Although the Star Forge itself is an artifact of the dark side, these robes were customized using an analysis of the Jedi they were created for, resulting in a powerful light side item that the Jedi can safely use against their enemies without fear of taint or corruption.
42740 := Adrenaline Stimulator
42741 := This belt endows the wearer with hyper-sensitivity to their surroundings and dynamically improves reflexes and reaction time.
42742 := CNS Strength Enhancer
42743 := An experimental system that amplifies power signals along the length of the central nervous system, this generator, attached to a belt, provides greater impulses to all muscles, as well as a resistance to all sorts of perturbations of the user's system.
42744 := Electrical Capacitance Shield
42745 := This shielding device, worn around the waist, absorbs and stores electrical energy directed at the user, which is then released slowly over a period of time, dissipating harmlessly. The manner of release generates vibrations along the inside edge of the shield, giving it the less than complimentary nickname, 'The Tingler'.
42746 := Thermal Shield Generator
42747 := This generator forms a magnetic shield around the wearer which, while ineffective against most modern weaponry, does allow for the ablation of directed heat attacks, generally in the form of fire.
42748 := Canderous' Hide
42749 := Droid Hide
42750 := HK-47 Hide 1
42751 := HK-47 Hide 2
42752 := HK-47 Hide 3
42753 := HK-47 Hide 4
42754 := HK-47 Hide 0
42755 := Dominator Gauntlets
42756 := A working proto-type of a huge technological advancement in power gauntlets, the Dominators give the user unparalleled strength and power.
42757 := Karakan Gauntlets
42758 := These heavy gauntlets, created by the isolationist Karakan, are almost a complete medical computer in themselves. They constantly monitor and adjust the nervous impulses, blood pressure, and tension through the wearers hands. The resulting increase in stability and overall system integrity have many benefits.
42759 := Infiltrator Gloves
42760 := These gloves are equipped with an advanced artifical intelligence unit that the wearer can use to tap into nearby computer systems through cables or wireless transmission. The system also stabilizes the wearer's hands for fine detail work.
42761 := Cardio Power System
42762 := This implant increases the cardio-vascular recovery rate and pain tolerance of the wearer, giving them almost supernatural stamina.
42763 := Gordulan Reaction System
42764 := This implant hyper-stimulates the nervous system of the wearer, significantly improving both reaction time and hand-eye coordination.
42765 := Navardan Regenerator
42766 := This implant gives incredible healing powers, allowing wounds and injuries to heal in mere seconds instead of days or weeks.
42767 := Sith Regenerator
42768 := Extensively used by Sith intelligence operatives, this implant stimulate cell replication in the user's body, allowing wounds to be healed quickly and easily. It is most frequently used on operatives operating behind enemy lines for extended periods, where medical treatment is not normally available.
42769 := Beemon Package
42770 := Beemon's top of the line package usurps the body's natural reactions to stress and damage, allowing the user to withstand greater amounts of punishment and exertion than normally possible.
42771 := Cyber Reaction System
42772 := This system supplants the user's normal nervous system, enhancing it artificially. It allows the impluses to travel faster and farther along the system, improving reaction time, while also improving fine motor control, increasing accuracy.
42773 := Circlet of Saresh
42774 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

The wealthy Saresh family of Taris were once known as much for their arrogance and cruelty as for their vast riches and political power. But over the last century many of the family have shown a strong affinity to the Force, and been taken in by the Jedi for training. Foremost among these was Guun Han Saresh, heir to the family fortune. To celebrate Guun Han's acceptance into the Order, his father commissioned the crafting of a powerful headband: the Circlet of Saresh. To prevent this spectacular gift from leading his son down the path of arrogance and pride - an all too real possibility given the Saresh family history - the circlet was fashioned so that only one who is a true servant of the light can use it. The circlet was in Gunn Han's possession when he disappeared shortly after the time of the Great Hunt.
42775 := Pistol Targetting Optics
42776 := This advanced optics and targetting system, worn as a mask, attaches to a held weapon, in this case pistol, and provides targetting information, distances, and tracking of potential targets within line of sight.
42777 := Heavy Targetting Optics
42778 := This advanced optics and targetting system, worn as a mask, attaches to a held weapon, in this case rifles and heavy weapons, and provides targetting information, distances, and tracking of potential targets within line of sight.
42779 := Dire Katarn Slam
42780 := Kinrath Stalker Claw
42781 := Dire Tuk'ata Bite
42782 := Shyrack Wyrm Bite
42783 := Crystal, Solari
42784 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

There are many famous lightsaber crystals spoken of in the history of the Jedi Order, though few are as powerful as the legendary Solari Crystal. An artifact of true light side power, only those Jedi who are pure in spirit can wield a lightsaber equipped with this gleaming white gem.
When the great Jedi Master Ood Bnar initiated his life-cycle change after a thousand years of serving the Order, he bequeathed the Solari Crystal to his most promising student, a young female Jedi named Shaela Nuur. When Shaela disappeared shortly after the time of the Great Hunt, the Solari Crystal vanished with her.
42785 := GenoHaradan Mesh Armor
42786 := This perfectly balanced armor provides maximum protection without hampering a Genoharadan agent's ability to stalk his prey in total secrecy.
42787 := GenoHaradan Poison Blade
42788 := Forged by the Genoharadan for the exclusive use of their agents, this deadly assassin's blade contains a cannister that emits small doses of poison with each successful hit on an opponent.
42789 := GenoHaradan Blaster
42790 := The GenoHaradan created this blaster as a tool to strike against well-protected assassination targets. It's remarkable accuracy makes it the perfect weapon for precision, long range strikes.
42791 := This datapad contains a single short, cryptic message: The Genoharadan say to see Hulas on Manaan. Come alone or not at all.
42792 := GenoHaradan Power Gloves
42793 := Modeled on the Eriadu designs, these gloves use bursts of repulsor-lift energy to assist movement, effectively giving the wearer tremendous strength.
42794 := GenoHaradan Stealth Unit
42795 := The assassins of the GenoHaradan work in absolute secrecy, thanks to items such as this highly advanced stealth unit.
42796 := GenoHaradan Visor
42797 := Restricted:
not useable by Wookiees

These visors hone a Genoharadan agent's senses, making them virtually impossible to catch unaware. The enhanced awareness also increases the agent's effectiveness in combat and in setting delicate, complex explosives.
42798 := All Messengers
42799 := Zone Controller
42800 := Transition Abort Object
42801 := Zone Catalogue
42802 := wp_transabort
42803 := The village of Rwookrrorro has been sealed off by Czerka Corporation and Chuundar. You have been excluded from any further village business. If the fate of any previously missing Wookiees is still considered important, that investigation will fall to someone other than you.
42804 := You have the codes to disable the Ebon Hawk's security system. Now you just have to get to the hangar and board the ship before it's too late.
42805 := A messenger has informed you that Canderous Ordo, a Mandalorian working for the local crime lord, wants a meeting. Although associating with a known felon may not be the wisest move, you do need all the potential allies you can get if you want to get off Taris. Canderous will be waiting for you in the cantina.
42806 := Genoharadan
42807 := A Twi'lek named Senni Vek has given you a datapad he claims you dropped. On the datapad is a cryptic message:
The Genoharadan say to see Hulas on Manaan. Come alone or not at all.
42808 := You tried talking to Hulas about the Genoharadan, but he claimed not to know anything. Maybe he will speak to you if you leave the rest of your party back in the Ebon Hawk.
42809 := Hulas has revealed that the Genoharadan are a secret society of bounty hunters and assassins that have existed for twenty thousand years. Hulas has offered to let you join the mysterious group, if you can prove yourself worthy. You should speak to him when you are ready to begin your initiation into the guild.
42810 := You've learned that the Genoharadan are a secret society of bounty hunters and assassins. They extended an offer to join their guild, but you turned them down. It is unlikely a second offer will be forthcoming.
42811 := Hulas has played you for a fool. One of the four leaders of the Genoharadan, he used you to eliminate the other three, giving him sole control of the guild. But you still have a chance for revenge. Hulas has promised to meet you in the Dune Sea of Tatooine for a final showdown. As with all the business of the Genoharadan, you must do this without the help of your friends.
42812 := Hulas has played you for a fool. One of the four leaders of the Genoharadan, he used you to eliminate the other three, giving him sole control of the guild. Now he has vanished back into the shadows. It is unlikely you will see him again anytime soon.
42813 := You met Hulas in the Dune Sea, but the traitor was not alone. He and his followers ambushed you in the hopes to forever silence what you know about the Genoharadan, resulting in a savage battle.
42814 := You have failed in your effort to join the Genoharadan. Hulas has disappeared, and it is unlikely you will ever see him or any of his order again.
42815 := You have brought your companions with you to confront Hulas in the Dune Sea. This violates the Genoharadan code of silence, but it hardly matters anymore. With the death of so many Overseers to your credit it's likely the guild will want to stay as far away from you as possible.
42816 := Genoharadan: Ithorak
42817 := You've been instructed to kill a Selkath named Ithorak Guldar. You've been told to go speak to his agent, a Twi'lek named Vek at the swoop track on Manaan. By posing as a representative of a wealthy Coruscant family you might be able to lure your prey out.
42818 := Ithorak is dead. Now you just have to return to Hulas and collect his bounty.
42819 := You've collected the bounty for Ithorak.
42820 := Vek has agreed to set up a meeting between you and Ithorak. You can meet him in the second docking bay of the Manaan space port.
42821 := You've convinced Vek to abandon Ithorak; not very difficult considering how the Twi'lek felt towards his boss. But you still have to deal with Ithorak himself. He's waiting for you inside the hangar at the docking bay.
42822 := Genoharadan: Lorgal
42823 := You've been instructed to kill a Rodian named Lorgal. He is currently being held as a prisoner in the Republic base on Manaan. Hulas has told you to make it look like an accident.
42824 := Lorgal is dead. Now you just have to return to Hulas and collect his bounty.
42825 := You've collected the bounty for Lorgal.
42826 := Now that you are no longer working for the Genoharadan, there isn't much point in collecting the bounty on Lorgal.
42827 := Genoharadan: Rulan
42828 := You've been instructed to kill a shapeshifting alien named Rulan. Hulas has advised you to look for him on Kashyyyk.
42829 := Rulan is dead. Now you just have to return to Hulas and collect his bounty.
42830 := Using stealth and his shapeshifting ability, Rulan has escaped you.
42831 := Because Rulan is still alive, Hulas has refused to give you the bounty for him. Maybe you should go back to Kashyyyk and try to track your quarry down.
42832 := You've collected the bounty for Rulan.
42833 := Genoharadan: Vorn
42834 := You've been instructed to kill a Gammorean named Vorn Daasraad. He is suspected to be on Tatooine hunting Krayt dragons. Hulas has warned you to be careful of Vorn's assault droid companion.
42835 := Vorn is dead. Now you just have to return to Hulas and collect his bounty.
42836 := You've collected the bounty for Vorn.
42837 := Genoharadan: Zuulan
42838 := You've been instructed to kill a Gran slaver named Zuulan Sentar. You should look for him on Dantooine near the noble estates. Zuulan will probably be near his landspeeder. Of course you can mention this to no one - not that they would believe you anyway.
42839 := Zuulan Sentar is dead. Now you have to go back to Hulas on Manaan to collect your reward.
42840 := You let Zuulan go in exchange for a handful of credits. It will be interesting to see how Hulas reacts to the news.
42841 := You have collected the bounty for Zuulan from Hulas.
42842 := Hulas was not impressed by your failure to kill Zuulan.
42843 := Now that you are no longer working for the Genoharadan, there isn't much point in collecting the bounty on Zuulan.
42844 := You've decided it would be more efficient to just slaughter the infected Outcasts rather than help them.
42845 := Invisible Mandalorians
42846 := You have been told that there are Mandalorian raiders near the Temple of the Ancients, that have been preying on Rakatan scouts. The leader of these scouting bands has asked you to help him kill the ones who slaughtered his warriors.

He says they usually stalk near a single pillar on the far side of the Temple.
42847 := You have slain the Mandalorian leader who has been killing the Rakatans recently. You should bring back a token to prove that you have killed him.
42848 := You have brought the head of the leader of the raiders back and proven that you have slain them. The Rakatan was very grateful and showed you some gear which may prove useful.
42849 := You were ambushed by some Mandalorians. They thought they could defeat you, but you proved them wrong.
42850 := You've killed Largo, who apparently had a bounty on his head. Now, if only you knew where to go to collect it...
42851 := Meeting Canderous
42852 := You've been told that Canderous Ordo, the Mandalorian mercenary working for Davik Kang, wants to meet with you. He's waiting for you in the cantina.
42853 := You've met with Canderous, and he's offered you a deal to get off of Taris. The only catch is you'll have to break into the Sith base and get the departure codes before he'll deal with you.
42854 := Bolook has taken the two suspects in Calder's murder back to the enclave, though it was obvious the Jedi was disappointed by your inability to solve the case.
42855 := Rakatan Research
42856 := You have discovered that the Elders are researching the genetic history of their people in an attempt to make them Force sensitive again. They believe that this will allow them to peaceful re-enter galactic society.

They think that there may be information stored in the Temple that could help them.
42857 := You have retrieved some genetic data from the ancient computer in the catacombs of the Temple of the Ancients. You're sure the Elder Researchers would find this information very useful.
42858 := You have given the genetic data you found in the Temple of the Ancients to the Elder Researchers. They are most pleased. They thanked you profusely and you think that this information will advance their research considerably.
42859 := Republic Embassy
42860 := The Republic soldier you met in the docking bays on Manaan seemed to think you might have a hard time finding the Embassy here in the city... Perhaps it's a big place.

He said you go south to the first courtyard, then east to the second courtyard, and it's in the northeast section of that area.
42861 := You finally managed to find the Republic Embassy on Manaan.
42862 := Roland Wann, the Republic diplomat on Manaan, has indicated that he may know something about ancient ruins on Manaan. He first requires you to retrieve a data module stolen by the Sith and bring it back to him before he'll tell you anything.

Perhaps if you asked him about this, he could tell you how you might accomplish this.
42863 := The Ebon Hawk
42864 :=   You have now gained possession of the Ebon Hawk, your own space vessel. With it, you can travel throughout the galaxy to any world you choose. Unfortunately, your choices are fairly limited right now, because the Jedi Council will not let you leave Dantooine.
  Most of your party will remain aboard the Ebon Hawk while you explore Dantooine. Should you need them, they will await you there.
  In one of the holds, there is a workshop of tools you could use to upgrade existing weapons and armor if you buy enhancements for them.
  Additionally, it would seem that Davik had stored a swoop bike aboard the Ebon Hawk before you stole it. If you found a track somewhere, you might be able to make some good money with it.

42865 := The Jedi Council
42866 := The Council are likely finished their deliberations now, and you will want to find out what they mean to do with you.

Bastila has also run off and is probably with them as well.
42867 := The One is dead, slaughtered by your hand. You won't be able to count on help from him or his tribe now.
42868 := You've crashed on a small, uncharted planet. In order to escape, you'll need to find some new stabilizers to repair the Ebon Hawk and you'll have to find some way to disable the disruptor field that caused you to crash in the first place.

You've encountered some Duros who crashed on this world as well. They were about to be attacked by a fierce group of natives. What other creatures might call this world home?
42869 := The Elders have offered to get you inside the Temple of the Ancients if you rescue one of their tribe being held hostage in the camp of the One.
42870 := The Elders have agreed to help you get inside the Temple of the Ancients. Once inside, you should be able to find a way to disable the disruptor field and get off this  planet. You only have to speak to them when you're ready to go in, though in accordance with ancient traditions they have insisted you go in alone.
42871 := You've rescued a Rakata being held prisoner by the One. Now that he's been saved, it is likely his tribe - the Elders - will help you find a way off this world. You should go speak to them in their enclave near the Temple of the Ancients.
42872 := [Until you have talked with the Jedi Council, you will be unable to switch characters in and out of the party.]
42873 := I hope you enjoy your time here on Dantooine. May the Force be with you.
42874 := Yes, Padawan? Is there something I can help you with?
42875 := Then may the Force be with you.
42876 := If you have questions you should speak with Master Dorak. He is the Chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, and is far more knowledgeable than I.
42877 := The Great Hunt was organized by the Jedi Council shortly after the war against Exar Kun. Jedi were scattered throughout the galaxy, helping to rebuild from the devastation.
42878 := Many Jedi vanished during this period, disappearing from a variety of worlds without warning. We did not know they had been slain until their mutilated bodies began to be discovered.
42879 := The Council investigated, and discovered the terentatek were behind the killings. It was decided the galaxy had to be purged of these insatiable monsters - though the cost proved high.
42880 := Many Jedi banded together and journeyed to the planets that were suspected of harboring the terentatek. The Great Hunt did not rest until all the creatures had been slain - or almost all.
42881 := There were still rumors of terentatek on the planet of Korriban, a dark world some believe to be the birthplace of the Sith. That is where Exar Kun was corrupted during the first Sith War.
42882 := They never went to Korriban. The Council, fearing more Jedi might fall to the dark side, declared the Great Hunt was officially over... though three Jedi were appointed to continue the work. 
42883 := The Jedi chosen to continue the hunt on their own were Duron Qel-Droma, Guun Han Saresh and Shaela Nur. These three shared a powerful bond, and each of them was devoted to the light.
42884 := The Council felt that together they would be able to defeat any terentatek they found. And by supporting each other they could resist the temptations of Korriban and the lure of the dark side.
42885 := But none of the three survived. Their Master felt them become one with the Force when they left this world. He believed they were slain by one of the monsters they sought.
42886 := The Council felt it was too dangerous to send anyone else in search of their remains, so their exact fate is not known. But let their deaths serve as a warning to you, Padawan.
42887 := The terentatek are an abomination, they are ruthless engines of death and destruction. The Council had no choice but to destroy them, for the greater good of the galaxy.
42888 := There is not much I can tell you other than their names: Duron Qel-Droma, Guun Han Saresh and Shaela Nur. They disappeared nearly forty years ago, long before my time at the Academy.
42889 := The Council is certain they are dead; their Master sensed them leaving this world to become one with the Force. More than this, I cannot say.
42890 := Then the galaxy is a better place for it. Every one of these creatures is an abomination that must be exterminated. You have done well, Padawan. 
42891 := But do not let your success blind you to the dangers of these monsters. A Jedi must never become complacent when facing one of the terentatek, as you well know.
42892 := Is there anything else I can do for you, Padawan?
42893 := I hear that Master Zhar feels you are now ready to become a full fledged memer of our Order. Congratulations, apprentice. Or should I say Padawan?
42894 := It brings me great joy to see another who has joined our Order, particularly in these trying times. The path of the light is a difficult one to walk, and many have fallen into the darkness.
42895 := But I am certain you will not be one of those. So, Padawan - what can I do for you?
42896 := Greetings, apprentice. How goes your training? I hear you are progressing at an astonishing rate.
42897 := There are caves here on Dantooine that hold the rare crystals we use in our lightsabers. But if you wish to go there, you must be careful. The caves are a place of great danger.
42898 := Of course. Learning the Code is an essential part of our training, for there is great wisdom in its words. Allow me to help you with this, apprentice.
42899 := There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
42900 := Take heed of these words, apprentice. They contain a deeper truth than it first appears.
42901 := Patience, apprentice. The Force is a great gift, but it also brings us a heavy burden.
42902 := The lessons we learn at the feet of our Masters teach us to use the Force for good. They show us the power of the light side, and protect us from the dark.
42903 := Good luck with your continued training. May the Force be with you.
42904 := Welcome to the Jedi enclave on Dantooine. I do not believe we know each other. My name is Deesra Luur Jada. You may call me Deesra.
42905 := You must be the new apprentice Master Zhar is training. I hear you are progressing at an astonishing rate. How are you finding your lessons?
42906 := I have not heard of any new apprentices being accepted for training recently. What brings you to this place, if I may ask?
42907 := Oh... I see. Very well, I have no wish to make you uncomfortable. I suppose I shall just wish you a good day, then.
42908 := Yes, of course. I should have known. I have only heard a little of how she escaped the destruction of Taris. Tell me, did she save you from that planet as well?
42909 := Oh, I see. Well, I meant no offense of course. In any case, it is good to have her back here on Dantooine again. We were afraid Malak had captured her.
42910 := Padawan, a word, if I may. There are many rumors about your most recent meeting with the Jedi Council. There is talk that they are sending you on a mission to help us against Malak and the Sith.
42911 := Please understand that I am not asking you to reveal anything that could endanger the Order or the Republic. Whatever task the Council has given you is for your ears, not mine.
42912 := I only wanted to wish you well, and to warn you to be careful. There are many evils out there, many dangers. The Sith are not the only minions of the dark side.
42913 := Yes, your skill and prowess are already well known throughout this Academy. But even you would be wise to heed my warnings.
42914 := Master Dorak has been training me to succeed him as Chronicler here in the Academy. In my studies I have come across tales of creatures that are born of the dark side, monsters of pure evil.
42915 := The worst of these abominations is the terentatek, a beast that feeds on the blood of those who are strong in the Force. Over the centuries, many Jedi have fallen to their ravenous hunger.
42916 := You have completed your initial training in a fraction of the normal time. The Force is very strong with you. I'm afraid you might become a target for these creatures.
42917 := The terentatek is a predator, and we Jedi are its prey. They are incredibly strong, with a primal cunning. And they have an in-born resistance to the Force.
42918 := There are some who believe the terentatek is a monster bred by the ancient Sith, and spread throughout the galaxy to destroy the Jedi.
42919 := Fortunately, the terentatek is quite rare. They only dwell in the most dangerous and darkest of places. In fact, one has not been seen in nearly forty years.
42920 := This is not the first time the terentatek have vanished for long periods of time. Many believe they can lay dormant for years, only to rise and hunt when the power of the dark side waxes full.
42921 := I fear Malak's rise may have woken these creatures from their dormant state. Once the Sith are beaten, I would not be surprised if the Council organized another Great Hunt to try and exterminate them.
42922 := A final warning as you go, Padawan: do not underestimate the terentatek. If you do, you may suffer the same fate as those who disappeared after the Great Hunt.
42923 := I saw you going into the Council chambers. You were in there for some time. I naturally assumed the Council had given you a task to perform.
42924 := I'll be going now.
42925 := I want to ask you some questions.
42926 := Tell me about the Great Hunt you mentioned before.
42927 := Cost? What cost?
42928 := Why? What was so special about those three?
42929 := The work of killing the terentatek, you mean.
42930 := So the Jedi just killed these creatures?
42931 := Tell me about the three Jedi lost after the Great Hunt.
42932 := I just came to tell you that I've killed a terentatek
42933 := I am looking for crystals to alter my lightsaber.
42934 := I am still learning the Jedi Code.
42935 := The Masters are bringing me along too slowly. They're holding me back.
42936 := It's difficult, but worthwhile.
42937 := My business here is my own.
42938 := I came here with Bastila.
42939 := Get your story straight: I'm the one who saved her!
42940 := She didn't save me. We worked together to escape Taris.
42941 := My discussions with the Council are none of your business!
42942 := I don't think the Council would want me to speak openly of this mission.
42943 := I can look after myself.
42944 := What are you talking about?
42945 := What could be more dangerous than the Sith?
42946 := Why are you telling me this?
42947 := It's hard to believe an animal could pose a threat to a Jedi.
42948 := What makes this creature so dangerous?
42949 := Then why are you worried about them now?
42950 := Sounds like they're extinct.
42951 := I can't waste time listening to your fables!
42952 := Thanks for the warning. I'll be careful.
42953 := The Great Hunt? What's that?
42954 := How do you know the Council gave me a mission?
42955 := As a matter of fact, I do. If you see any you like, I am willing to part with them for a small sum.
42956 := I seem to have run out of funds... If you wish to play again, I could wager these cards instead.
42957 := Do you wish to play?
42958 := Let's get started then.
42959 := Is there anything else you wish?
42960 := Do you have any cards to sell?
42961 := Sure, I'll play.

42977 := Of course I shall endeavor to be of service to whatever endeavor you are on. What is it you wish to ask?
42978 := I am sorry, but I have not been on this world long. I am not familiar with any specific locales in this area.
42979 := I am sorry, but I have not been on this world long. I am not familiar with the rich cultural history of its hardy peoples.
42980 := Fearsome beasts! Predators! A danger that the settlers of this world must constantly face and do battle with!
42981 := And what better way to battle them than with this handy Blaster Pistol! Crafted from the finest, sturdiest materials, it can stop a kath hound dead in its tracks at fifty paces!
42982 := I am sorry, but I have not been on this world long. I am not familiar with the names of all the sentients who dwell here.
42983 := Is there something else you wish to ask?
42984 := A plague on this world... a plague that must be cleansed with fire!
42985 := Fire generated from a sterling example of weaponcraft such as this fine Blaster Rifle right here. Can't do better, you know!
42986 := Maps? Why yes, yes I have.
42987 := What areas would you like a map to? I am afraid I do not have all areas of maps, though.
42988 := Well then, yes, what is it that you want?
42989 := Maps for little, maps for cheap! Only 2 credits for this fine, fine map.
42990 := Come back, then, when enough money is there, and the map I'll have.

42995 := Yes, yes! Here is the best you can find anywhere on this world!
42996 := Greetings, fellow sentient! I notice that you are not heavily armed... or at least, not heavily armed, enough!
42997 := Please allow my self to introduce myself. I am Adum, a simple merchant with a much noble purpose!
42998 := Yes! Noble it is!
42999 := Yes! Purpose!
43000 := The settlers and noble humans of Dantooine have been plagued by kath hounds, raiders and other fearsome troubles of late.
43001 := It is much, much too sad to see these things happen to such people as this. Therefore, I have made this my mission to be!
43002 := To overcome their troubles, they must be able to defend themselves. Therefore, I shall offer the highest of quality of weapons at the lowest of low of prices for them!
43003 := I am here, offering you much in the way of weaponry at low, low prices! How can any sentient pass up such a bargain? They cannot!
43004 := I think I should be going now.
43005 := I would like to ask you some questions.
43006 := Actually, I'd like to see what you have in stock.
43007 := What do you know about the corrupted grove?
43008 := What do you know about ancient ruins here?
43009 := What do you know about the kath hounds?
43010 := What do you know about the Sandral-Matale feud?
43011 := What do you know of the Mandalorian raiders?
43012 := I'd like to take a closer look at your weapons.
43013 := Um... yeah, hold it. I'd like to ask something else.
43014 := Do you happen to have any maps of the area?
43015 := I'd like to ask something else.
43016 := I would like a map to the area south of here.
43017 := I don't have enough.
43018 := I'll take it.
43019 := I would like a map to this area.
43020 := I don't have enough.
43021 := I'll take it.

43301 := Yes, I promised you an answer when we reached the Ebon Hawk, didn't I? But I'm afraid you won't like it. We should have some privacy for this.
43302 := You're stronger than I am, and there's no point in telling me otherwise. You will be a great Jedi, I think. I hope.
43303 := I can't deny that there are parts of you I am drawn to. Your power, your will. You are so much stronger than I am.
43304 := In some ways you make me feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. But at the same time, you make me feel stronger, more alive.
43305 := I realize now these feelings are part of the bond we share. The Jedi Council surely realized this; they knew my loyalty to the doctrines of our Order would be tested on this mission.
43306 := By facing and overcoming my feelings for you I have learned a valuable lesson about control and the dangers of emotion. This is an important step in understanding the Force.
43307 := I'm sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear. But I felt it was important you know our... infatuation... was nothing more than a result of our powerful bond.
43308 := I'm... afraid so. Although I suppose I should thank you for all you've done. For the lessons you helped me learn.
43309 := Oh, I thought... No, this is good. I'm glad you told me. This makes everything much easier.
43310 := Don't worry - I can put this behind me. Let's just continue on with what we must do. It is better this way.
43311 := I wish it could be otherwise, but you have to understand that this is the way it must be. I am a Jedi, after all.
43312 := I hope you can put this behind you. You need to focus on stopping Malak, as difficult as that may be. Come, we should continue our mission.
43313 := You're the one who can't face the truth! Malak has to be stopped. How can I do that if I let myself be blinded by my feelings for you?
43314 := You... you mean it, don't you? But how can I be sure you aren't making a mistake. I... I have to resist. I have to be strong for both of us.
43315 := But I don't... I mean, I can't... Malak will...
43316 := Okay, you've made your point. Now shut up and kiss me, you fool!
43317 := We... we shouldn't have done that. It was wrong. The Jedi aren't allowed to fall in love.
43318 := It was... it was a moment of weakness. When I kissed you... we shouldn't have... no, I'm sorry.
43319 := I know we both wanted it, but we shouldn't have given in to our desire. We're Jedi! We can't act like this. Not now, not while we still have to deal with Malak!
43320 := I'm... I'm sorry. I don't blame you, but... it was a mistake. I have to get out of here before somebody sees us together!
43321 := Oh, my!
43322 := Please, don't say it like that. You make it sound like I was using you! Don't you realize how difficult this was for me?
43323 := Why do you think I came to this decision? I know how hard this is for both of us! You just kept pressing forward, so I had to be the one to step up and do the right thing!
43324 := And I feel more alive when I'm with you.
43325 := So that's it? It's all over?
43326 := That's okay - I never felt anything for you anyway.
43327 := Great - you learn a lesson and I get dumped!
43328 := I... I understand, Bastila.
43329 := You're rationalizing, Bastila. You're just scared to face the truth!
43330 := I'm going to stop Malak, Bastila. But I want to do it with you at my side.
43331 := You don't always have to be strong, Bastila. Give in just this once.
43332 := You know I'm right, Bastila.
43333 := I love you Bastila. And I know you love me.
43334 := We're not going back to this again, are we?
43335 := It didn't feel wrong to me.
43336 := Shut up and kiss me, you babbling fool.
43337 := So I was just a stepping stone to you becoming a Master?
43338 := This is nothing but an excuse! You're afraid to face your feelings!
43339 := Difficult for you? What about me?

43402 := Chuundar is very interested in furthering our exchange of labor for weapons. We've begun expanding our operations, as I'm sure you've seen.
43403 := It was the gentlest outcome possible. I am sure that everyone will come to see this in time.
43404 := The time for objections is long since passed, if there ever was one. You brought about this change. You have no one to blame.
43405 := Czerka will be operating here for quite some time. All things considered, this was the gentlest outcome possible.
43406 := I have no objections. Chuundar showed me the way things must be. There is nothing for me here. The old ways are dead.
43407 := Er, the tone of your Wookiee's muttering seems agreable. He likely agrees that this was the gentlest outcome possible.
43408 := Very well. Thank you again for your assistance.
43409 := I have no information about that. You appear to have explored deeper than any of our current expeditions. I certainly can't expand on what you've seen.
43410 := I would think that the thanks of Czerka Corporation would be enough, especially after your previous actions. You have caused us significant difficulty.
43411 := I have reports about you meddling with our operations in the Shadowlands. I think we will consider this agrement with Chuundar to be fair compensation. Yes, that is what we will do.
43412 := Perhaps that is exactly why I have instructed the guards to watch your every action, and how I react to you. I have taken precautions reagrding your... capabilities.
43413 := No, I don't believe we will be extending any financial compensation to you today. Thank you for your assistance.
43414 := Czerka Corporation will begin an extensive examination of the commercial potential of this world. The Wookiees will aid us in this.

43496 := I would assume that he has very little to say, or he would have said it before.

43527 := But what do I care about Sith and Jedi? Czerka are the only outsiders here on Kashyyyk. And the mighty Chuundar does not bow down, even to them!
43528 := You are mistaken about your worth, Revan. You have no leverage here. I have all the power, and I have made certain that my people only listen to me.
43529 := And I am Darth Revan! You will listen to me, Chuundar.
43530 := [Persuade] I wasn't killed, I was only captured. Now Revan has returned - and you don't want to get on my bad side!

"We were fools to come down here, all of us. How can we hope to capture an enemy that can assume any shape, any form?

We lost two the first day, another three disappeared the day after that. Our enemy's bloodlust knows no limits.

We found Grarwwaar's body last night: what was left of it. If we do not leave the Shadowlands soon, I fear we will all become victims of the Faceless One."

43613 := This data pad was recovered from the remains of a terentatek on Kashyyyk, and must have been devoured by the beast. It appears to be the personal journal of Guun Han Saresh. The last entry explains what he was doing on Kashyyyk:

Duran and Shaela have given in to their passion for each other, and are doomed to fall to the dark side. I tried to warn them against expressing their love, but they called me arrogant and accused me - ME! - of being the one on the dark path. I left the fools on Korriban.

But I am not about to abandon the mandate given me by the Jedi Council. I will destroy the terentatek wherever I find them. I have heard rumors such a beast may exist in the Shadowlands of Kashyyyk.

I shall go there and slay the beast, proving that I do not need either Duran or Shaela with me to defeat these creatures!

43623 := No, this is no game. I simply saw you drop this datapad and I wish to give it back to you.

43626 := Are you certain, human? Please, take the datapad.
43627 := Very well, human. I will keep the datapad and I will leave. Goodbye, human.
43628 := Uh... thanks.
43629 := What is this, some kind of con game?

43633 := I'll beat you to death with that datapad if you don't go away right now!
43634 := No. It's not mine. I won't take it.
43635 := Fine. Give me the stupid datapad!
43636 := [This unsavory looking man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.]
43637 := Welcome again, sentient. It is always a pleasure to serve the owner of the Ebon Hawk... it reminds me of old times.
43638 := Is there something you are needing now? 
43639 := Yes, of course. I'm sure you'll find my selection to be very interesting.
43640 := Greetings, sentient. You are the owner of the Ebon Hawk, yes? Or its latest owner, at least. I am honored to meet you.
43641 := The Sith do have a passage that leads to their valley from within the monastery. Only they may use it, however. 
43642 := I doubt they would let you in, even if you could somehow convince them of your true identity. Most of the Sith at the Academy are loyal to Malak, now. They see him as the true Master.
43643 := Only what I have heard from others: Uthar Wynn is dead, by your hand. I am hoping this will bring about a change in how the Sith will deal with others here on Dreshdae.
43644 := Since Malak stole the Order from you, the Academy here on Korriban has become all but impossible to deal with. The Sith there care for nothing but their own plots and schemes.
43645 := I hope that once you destroy your old apprentice things will return to the way they were before. The Sith and the Exchange should work together: it could benefit both sides.
43646 := I know very little about the owners of the Ebon Hawk. Most were affiliated with the Exchange, and they only revealed enough to enable us to do business with them.
43647 := But the ship itself is very well known, especially here on Korriban. Some say it is the finest smuggling vessel in this sector. Others say it is a cursed vessel, bringing doom to its owners.
43648 := None deny the Hawk is a fine vessel with a long history of successful smuggling runs to its credit. But the owners have not fared nearly as well the ship itself.
43649 := Take Davik Kang. He was the last owner I know of before you. His home world was the planet Taris - a world the Sith utterly destroyed. Few would call that a fortunate occurence.
43650 := And even if Taris hadn't been destroyed, would Davik still be around? It seems doubtful he *sold* the ship to you. And I know Davik didn't *buy* it from the previous owner.
43651 := Yes, I suppose a Sith Lord has little time for curses. You are probably far beyond such things. In any case, I meant no offense. I am only telling you what I know of the Hawk's reputation.
43652 := Is there anything else you are needing from me?
43653 := Only what I hear from rumors, sentient. The Hawk has been a frequent visitor to Korriban in the past, though often with a different owner.
43654 := In all fairness, I should tell you that many of the past owners were suspected of being smugglers, slavers and pirates. It was even whispered that some worked for the Exchange.
43655 := But I always found the Hawk's owners to be excellent citizens of fine character. The kind of people I prefer to do business with. Much better than the Sith, at least.
43656 := Yes, to the right buyer. Traditionally, the owner of the Ebon Hawk has been the contact for all my transactons. But in the past, the owner was always affiliated with the Exchange.
43657 := That was why Ziagrom did not approach you earlier. We had no idea who you were, or if we wanted to do business with you. Of course that has all changed now, Lord Revan.
43658 := Yes, let's get right to business. I carry only the rarest of items. Expensive, yes - but worth every credit! Weapons, armor, equipment: I carry a little of everything.
43659 := The previous owners of the Ebon Hawk would often resell the items they purchased, but in your case I imagine you might find more than a few of them quite useful against your old apprentice.
43660 := Of course. Remember to return whenever you desire to see my inventory of permium items. We are eager to help you against your old apprentice.
43661 := Of course. I will help you with whatever I can.
43662 := No? Ziagrom's information is never wrong. Are you saying that you don't want to revenge on your former apprentice? Are you saying you don't plan to kill Malak?
43663 := In truth, your reasons matter little to me or my partner. But we do believe in your power. We believe you will bring Malak down - and we want to help you, in our own small fashion.
43664 := Of course. How else are we to survive? Now, do you wish to see the premium items I have for sale? Or is there something else you need?
43665 := The light? A fine jest, though it contains a crystal of truth. We have allied with you in this conflict, and we trust you will remember us once victory is yours, Revan.
43666 := People are saying the Kolto supply on Manaan has been destroyed. Of course when I heard the news I immediately thought of you, <FullName>.
43667 := I am not making any judgements. But I marvel at how the galaxy is trembling at the power of your touch; how it is changed forever by your actions.
43668 := I find that hard to believe. Who else could have caused such a catastrophic change? You are a force of destiny; the galaxy is changed forever by your actions. Few can claim such power!
43669 := Perhaps. Perhaps not. In any case, the galaxy has been forever changed by your actions. You are a force of destiny, <FullName>.
43670 := Who else could have caused such a catastrophic change? You are a force of destiny, <FullName>. The galaxy is changed forever by even your slightest of actions.
43671 := But such actions have consequences, including drawing the attention of old enemies. You should probably look at my stock, <FullName>. It might come in useful in the coming battles.
43672 := The talk among the Czerka people is of a rebellion on the planet of Edean. It appears the wookiees have turned on their masters.
43673 := I have to assume you are the one responsible for this, <FullName>. I can think of no other who could bring about the collapse of Czerka's operations so spectacularly.
43674 := I only hope your actions don't draw the attention of your old apprentice. I'd suggest you stock up from my inventory in anticipation of your next meeting with Malak.
43675 := The Czerka people here in Dreshdae are saying the wookiees of Edean have had their spirits broken. They claim all thoughts of freeing themselves from Czerka have been crushed.
43676 := I sense your hand in this, <FullName>. The full might of Czerka hadn't been able to break the will of those hairy beastsl... until you arrived.
43677 := You might want to browse my inventory, <FullName>. I have many items you could use to help crush your enemies as easily as you crushed the wookiee rebellion.
43678 := I have heard a disturbing rumor, <FullName>. A hunter matching your description is reported to have slain a Krayt dragon on Tatooine. Please, tell me it wasn't you. 
43679 := I do not mean to pry, <FullName>. But the Krayt dragon is a fierce and deadly beast, a monster even one of your power would be smart to avoid!
43680 := If something should happen to you - if you are injured or even slain by such a beast - then Malak will never be toppled!
43681 := I suppose if there is anyone in the galaxy who could reasonably expect to survive such an encounter, it would be you, <FullName>.
43682 := But if you are going to continue with such reckless escapades, I would strongly recommend you stock up with weapons and armor from my inventory.
43683 := Please, I am not a fool. I understand your power, <FullName>. You are, after all, the Dark Lord of the Sith. But Krayt dragons are terrible monsters!
43684 := Let me see your premium items.
43685 := Do you know a lot about the Ebon Hawk and its previous owners?
43686 := And what do you say?
43687 := Cursed? What do you mean?
43688 := I don't believe in curses.
43689 := These events have more to do with the type of owner than the Hawk itself.
43690 := What do you know about the Ebon Hawk?
43691 := You know something about the Ebon Hawk?
43692 := Ziagrom says you sell... special items.
43693 := What kinds of things do you have for sale?
43694 := I'll be going now.
43695 := I have some questions for you.
43696 := I'm not who you think I am. I'm not Revan anymore.
43697 := I will stop Malak and his Sith, but not for revenge.
43698 := Your motives seem very self-serving.
43699 := I'm glad you've seen the light.
43700 := I destroyed the Kolto. So what?
43701 := [Lie] I don't know anything about it.
43702 := It was an accident, I swear.
43703 := Why did you think of me?
43704 := What business is it of yours if I hunt Krayt dragons.
43705 := I'm not scared of anything - not even a Krayt dragon!
43706 := I didn't have a choice, really.
43707 := I can look after myself.
43708 := [Lie] It wasn't me.
43709 := It was me. Why?
43710 := Hah! Too funny!
43711 := If you really want a fight just make the first move. It'll be your last.
43712 := Do you know who I am? I'm Darth Revan! Watch your tongue or I'll rip it out!
43713 := It's no joke. I really am Darth Revan.
43714 := Ha ha ha ha! Now *that* has to be the funniest thing I've heard all day.
43715 := Because I'm Darth Revan, and I'm telling you to let them go!
43716 := You are truly lucky, sentient, or truly skilled. I have no more credits to bet against you in a game, but I might be willing to bet some of my prize cards should that be adequate.
43717 := Let's play again.
43718 := Greetings; welcome to Korriban. If there's anything you need, you can talk to me.
43719 := Thanks for dropping by.
43720 := Weapons, mostly; I've got... connections. You'll need them, if you're going to be spending any time here.
43721 := Certainly; allow me to punch up the stock.
43722 := Mandalorian raiders occasionally drop by, needing to get rid of some extras that they can't sell in the civilized systems.
43723 := They treat me well, I treat them well. It works out.
43724 := So if you need weapons... and you probably will... this is the place to come.
43725 := There are a lot of Sith on this planet; this is where they come to study. Obnoxious brats, the lot of them.
43726 := Just between you and me, I'll never understand why everyone thinks 'dark side' and 'hooligan' should be the same thing.
43727 := But they are definitely dangerous. So that's why you'll probably need weapons. Heh... not that they'll be much help.
43728 := Really? You won't tell them what I said, will you?
43729 := You seem like a good sort, compared to most of the lot around here. I didn't mean anything by it.
43730 := I sell to anyone, no matter how they treat me. So, is there anything you'd like?
43731 := Good to see you again; is there anything you need?
43732 := Greetings. Say, aren't you the one who won that swoop race on Manaan? I'm a big fan.
43733 := I hope we can find something suited to a celebrity like you; is there anything you'd like?
43734 := Greetings; if you haven't heard, there is some trouble over at the academy. Best stay away from there. But anyhow... is there anything I can offer you today?
43735 := I don't really know much; but people have been either whispering or fighting around here, and my sales are through the roof.
43736 := Trouble's good for business, that's what I always say. Especially when it's Sith trouble.
43737 := So, how can I help you?
43738 := Not right now, thank you.
43739 := What sort of merchandise do you offer?
43740 := Can I see your merchandise?
43741 := What sort of connections?
43742 := Why will I need weapons?
43743 := Why so?
43744 := What connections do you have?
43745 := I'm training to be a Sith myself; I think I'll be alright.

Korriban is everything I imagined - and feared. I can feel the power of the dark side here, I can sense the terentatek hiding in this evil place.

Shaela and I have decided to venture forth into the Valley of the Sith Lords in search of the creatures. I only wish Guun Han was still with us.

Why couldn't he just accept that Shaela and I are in love? He claims our passion for each other will lead us down the dark side, but he can't even see how his own pride and arrogance are leading him away from the light. 

Maybe it is good that he left, after all. Even as dangerous as the terentatek are, I'm certain Shaela and I can defeat one without his help.

I have tracked the terentatek that ambushed us in the Shyrack caves to this tomb, but even as I stand at the entrance I know this is wrong.

Dark thoughts fill my mind: hatred and vengeance. I cannot stop myself from blaming Guun Han for Duran's death. If he had not abandoned us, my love would surely have survived the terentatek's first attack.

But my hatred of Guun Han pales beside my burning desire for revenge. My blood boils to destroy the creature that ended Duran's life, no matter what the cost. 

I know such thoughts are those of the dark side, but I cannot help them. Even the second set of tracks outside the cave cannot dissuade me from my task. One terentatek, two, a thousand... it makes no difference to me now.

The only image I see is that of Duran's broken body, and only blood can cleanse it from my mind.

I hope my Master will forgive me for what I am about to do.

44017 := You not Sith! Help me out of this cell, and me help you!
44018 := That not smart. You let me out, me help you. We both escape Sith. You come back when you see me right.
44019 := Good. You hurry now. Get cards from guards to get me out of cell. Me not want to be here when Sith torture me. Me not want to go insane like others.
44020 := It too late for them, but there still be hope for me! You get me out, and me escape before Sith torture break mind.
44021 := Evil Sith unjustly capture me and my ship! They think we spies. They torture all the crew, trying to get information. But we not have any information to give.
44022 := But Sith not care. They "interrogate" captain until his mind snap. Then they grab first mate. Then navigator... they all crazy now. Minds gone. So sad, but they nothing but animals now.
44023 := Me lowest rank on ship, but now me only one left. Soon Sith come to interrogate me, too. But me not know anything! Me just... uh... me just trader in "rare" goods.

44026 := Sith, uhm, Sith not very thorough in search, hehe.
44027 := You open cell, and me give you breaker, deal?

44029 := It too late for them. Minds gone, they crazy with hate and pain. Sad, very sad. But me got to worry about me now. Me got to escape before Sith take me for questioning.
44030 := Think what you will! But me have way into computers, and computers have way into hangar. Me can get off ship eventually, while you still running around corridors, fodder for guards.
44031 := Me bring things to people in need. People who need things they can't get normally.
44032 := Such unnice language! Me helps people, and people helps me! You helps me, and me helps you.
44033 := Me have something special. Something you can use on ship.
44034 := You there. Little droid. You not Sith droid. What you doing here?
44035 := What? Me not understand you, droid. But maybe you understand me, yes? You get me out of cell, droid, me help you. Me got special gift.
44036 := Something verrry powerful... an ICE breaker. Very useful for droid like you. It give you access to computers on this ship. You use it to override Sith security programs.
44037 := You wants ICE breaker, yes? If you get me out of cell, me give it to you. Hurry, little droid. Me want out of here before Sith torture me and me go insane like other rodians.
44038 := Haha! Me always knows good opportunity when me sees it. Here, you helped me, now me helps you.
44039 := Here - take ice breaker. It let you slice into computers on ship. Me has tuned the breaker to work on the brig computers, so you use it on brig level. It not work anywhere else.
44040 := Remember, the breaker only good for one use, so you not waste it. You go fight guards, me go and hide now, wait for chance to get to ship.
44041 := How can you help me?
44042 := Who are you again?
44043 := I think I'll just leave you locked up.
44044 := I'll see what I can do.

44049 := How did you get that in here?

44357 := Well, human, you find yourself in a most difficult situation. The Hrakert Rift is the most precious resource on Manaan, and anything that threatens it or the kolto it produces threatens our entire species.
44358 := We will not tolerate threats to our neutrality, our existence, and our way of life!
44359 := As much as we may admire your Republic and your Order in particular, I believe you will have a hard time explaining your role in this incident adequately.
44360 := The flow of pure kolto has stopped coming up from the ocean floor. Your submersible arose at approximately the same time this occured. We have deemed you responsible!
44361 := If the Republic has broken its neutrality treaty with us, the reprecussions shall be very grave indeed!
44362 := What have you done to the kolto supply? We warn you, human - if you lie to us we will know!
44363 := Harvesting machinery?? What are you talking about?
44364 := We know of this.
44365 := What?!
44366 := It will be discussed later.
44367 := This cannot be kept silent! The Council will...
44368 := The Council will hear nothing of this! And you will keep your silence or be ejected from the court!
44369 := But we cannot...
44370 := Silence!
44371 := What has happened to the research station? Why was this toxin released? If you were responsible, you will be banned from Manaan!
44372 := Malfunctioned?
44373 := Impossible! That machinery was constructed by us to last a thousand years!
44374 := Even if it did malfunction, the Hydrolium fuel would not have contaminated the kolto supply. The pressure at the sea floor is insufficient to keep it as a liquid.
44375 := What happened to the machinery, human? Someone must have injected the toxin into it... We will not accept excuses any longer!
44376 := You... you have destroyed the kolto? Why? Was our alliance with your Republic not good enough? Have you turned to this 'darkside' your Order seems obsessed with?
44377 := You have destroyed any hope of peace for our world!
44378 := We should kill this human and ban the entire Republic from Manaan completely!
44379 := You... you would threaten us with that? It would destroy your Republic in the process!
44380 := The Sith would no longer fear our destruction of the kolto, and would sweep through this sector unimpeded. You cannot be serious.
44381 := Do not doubt their kind so much... the are not rational like us. I fear this human may do exactly that...
44382 := We should kill her now! Before anyone knows!
44383 := No, there are others who would notice her absence and begin asking... difficult questions.
44384 := We should kill him now! Before anyone knows!
44385 := No, there are others who would notice his absence and begin asking... difficult questions.
44386 := We cannot ban the Republic for its actions, the Sith would gain too much, but we cannot let you go unpunished.
44387 := If we harm this human, it may yet tell what has happened!
44388 := It would seem you have trapped us in your net human. We cannot punish you directly for what you have done, yet we cannot abide the fact that you go unpunished.
44389 := But there is little we can do...
44390 := As long as you keep this secret, human, we shall cooperate with you. But if you break your silence...
44391 := Your death will be long and painful!
44392 := Enough! You may leave human, and we shall never speak of this again.
44393 := The human is right... Without the Republic to counter-balance the Sith, there would be no reason for them not to try to conquer us.
44394 := The Republic is a necessary evil it seems...  but this particular human is not.
44395 := We should kill her now! Before anyone knows!
44396 := No, there are others who would notice her absence and begin asking... difficult questions.
44397 := We should kill him now! Before anyone knows!
44398 := No, there are others who would notice his absence and begin asking... difficult questions.
44399 := We cannot ban the Republic for its actions, the Sith would gain too much, but we cannot let you go unpunished.
44400 := Mad? I find that hard to believe, human.
44401 := We did receive those transmission just before the station went silent...
44402 := Ask the human what happened!
44403 := Well, human? What drove all the sentients down there mad?
44404 := [Success] Bah! This humans information is worthless! We have lost the kolto, and now everything will collapse down upon us!
44405 := Do not speak of such things around outsiders!
44406 := If the entire station was driven mad, as would seem to be the case, surely there must have been some evidence that something had transpired down there. What was it?
44407 := [Failure] We do not believe you, human! Tell us what you know or you will not leave here alive!
44408 := You dare accuse us of being to blame for the destruction of the kolto!? You impudent, off-world scum! We should...
44409 := Calm yourself. We are more advanced than that.
44410 := Why do you say that only we Selkath went mad?
44411 := But why? If the entire station was driven mad, as would seem to be the case, surely there must have been some evidence that something had transpired down there. What was it?
44412 := The toxin was used against a giant firaxan...
44413 := A giant firaxan? Could it be...
44414 := Impossible! It is only a legend.
44415 := But she said she killed it... didn't she?
44416 := But he said he killed it... didn't he?
44417 := You killed this shark, human?
44418 := She killed the Progenitor!
44419 := He killed the Progenitor!
44420 := We do not know for certain if it was our mythical ancestor! None have seen it!
44421 := What else could it be? It is the life-giver of our species...
44422 := The human has destroyed everything! First our safety, with the kolto, now our entire history!
44423 := Regain your control! We are not emotional and illogical like off-worlders! We can deal with this!
44424 := No, no, no...
44425 := This thing... this human, should die for what they have done!
44426 := [Success] The Sith were down at the Rift?!
44427 := But how could the Sith have been there when we had...
44428 := What?
44429 := When we... we monitor the Rift constantly. How could the Sith have approached it without us knowing?
44430 := [Success] Some... Selkath?
44431 := Selkath would not be helping off-worlders to disrupt our most valuable resources!
44432 := Foreign... interests have been known to influence individuals before...
44433 := Have you seen this, human? Is this how you know of it?
44434 := What?
44435 := I knew it! It was the Republic, wasn't it!
44436 := [Failure] Enough of these games, human!
44437 := We know about the station and our personnel there! What has happened to them?
44438 := Our what??
44439 := Silence. It will be discussed later.
44440 := We know more than you think, human! Your lies do not fool us! I will warn you against lying to us again. Now, what REALLY occurred down there?
44441 := [Failure] Your lies only make the hole you dig yourself deeper, human!
44442 := It is likely that you have sabotaged our efforts AND the facilities at the Hrakert Rift, destroying the kolto. For this you must pay the price.
44443 := How do we know this? What have you been hiding from us? What facilities??
44444 := It is not an issue to be discussed among outsiders.
44445 := No! I demand answers! What has been happening down there?
44446 := Our agreement with the Republic to research and synthesize kolto has borne us disaster. That is all you need to know.
44447 := The Republic... Why were we not informed?
44448 := It was not necessary for you to know. Now keep your silence!
44449 := This we know. What happened there, off-worlder?
44450 := We know??
44451 := They have already attempted to seduce our young away from us... Who's to say they hadn't corrupted someone else?
44452 := [Success] That they could smuggle onto Manaan without our knowing about it? Impossible!
44453 := You fail to realize that if they had such a stealth field, we would not be able to detect them bringing it either.
44454 := But that area is closely monitored... We would have detected any new vessels approaching it just by perturbations in the currents.
44455 := [Success] I find that highly unlikely... How could we have missed such a large undertaking?
44456 := Impossible! Our own sta...
44457 := Our what?
44458 := It is impossible... that's all...
44459 := [Failure] Do not try to manipulate us with your powers, human! You have only one chance left to tell us the truth!
44460 := Enough of your lies!
44461 := We have determined that you are responsible for the detonations that occurred near the Hrakert Rift. We demand to know what occurred down there!
44462 := If the Republic has broken its neutrality treaty with us, the reprecussions shall be very grave indeed!
44463 := What have you done to the Rift?
44464 := Research Station?! What are you talking about? Dont try to lie to us, human!
44465 := We know of this.
44466 := What?!
44467 := It will be discussed later.
44468 := This cannot be kept silent! The Council will...
44469 := The Council will hear nothing of this! And you will keep your silence or be ejected from the court!
44470 := But we cannot...
44471 := Silence!
44472 := What has happened at the research station? What caused the explosions?
44473 := Malfunctioned?
44474 := Impossible! That machinery was constructed by us to last a thousand years!
44475 := Even if it did malfunction, the Hydrolium pressure would not have caused an explosion... unless it was deliberately set.
44476 := What happened to the machinery, human? We will not accept excuses any longer!
44477 := You... YOU destroyed the machinery?!
44478 := You have ruined our efforts! All our work to synthesize kolto is worthless now!
44479 := Why did you do this... this thing, human?
44480 := A paltry appeasement! I say we should kill this human for the impudence she has shown us, and the destruction of our station!
44481 := A paltry appeasement! I say we should kill this human for the impudence he has shown us, and the destruction of our station!
44482 := No. If we are rash, then we may never get the information we need to synthesize kolto.
44483 := This would seem to be a necessary evil...
44484 := We agree, human. In return for this data, we shall not execute you. But you cannot go unpunished.
44485 := We will allow the Republic to remain on this world, but you must answer for your own actions.
44486 := Mad? I find that hard to believe, human.
44487 := We did receive those transmission just before the station went silent...
44488 := Ask the human what happened!
44489 := Well, human? What drove all the sentients down there mad?
44490 := [Success] Bah! This humans information is worthless! We have lost the facility on the bottom of the ocean. Our efforts will be exposed!
44491 := If the entire station was driven mad, as would seem to be the case, surely there must have been some evidence that something had transpired down there. What was it?
44492 := [Failure] We do not believe you, human! Tell us what you know or you will not leave here alive!
44493 := [Failure] Your lies only make the hole you dig yourself deeper, human!
44494 := It is likely that you have sabotaged our efforts AND the facilities at the Hrakert Rift. For this you must pay the price.
44495 := You accuse us of being to blame for this?
44496 := Calm yourself. We are more advanced than that.
44497 := Why do you say that only we Selkath went mad?
44498 := But why? If the entire station was driven mad, as would seem to be the case, surely there must have been some evidence that something had transpired down there. What was it?
44499 := The explosion... to kill a giant firaxan?
44500 := And you destroyed the harvester to kill a giant firaxan...
44501 := A giant firaxan? Could it be...
44502 := Impossible! It is only a legend.
44503 := But she said she killed it... didn't she?
44504 := But he said he killed it... didn't he?
44505 := You killed this shark, human?
44506 := The Progenitor... it must have been!
44507 := Be quiet! That is merely a myth, and not fit for outsiders to hear!
44508 := But if it was the life-bringer... the ancestor of our species... Think of what this could mean!
44509 := If it always laired there... then perhaps the kolto...
44510 := Enough! Off-worlders are not to hear of such things!
44511 := But she said she saved it... She destroyed the harvesters to save it.
44512 := But he said he saved it... He destroyed the harvesters to save it.
44513 := Indeed. This casts your actions in a new light, human.
44514 := [Success] The Sith were down at the Rift?!
44515 := But how could the Sith have been there when we had...
44516 := What?
44517 := When we... we monitor the Rift constantly. How could the Sith have approached it without us knowing?
44518 := [Success] Some... Selkath?
44519 := Selkath would not be helping off-worlders to disrupt our most valuable resources!
44520 := Foreign... interests have been known to influence individuals before...
44521 := Have you seen this, human? Is this how you know of it?
44522 := What?
44523 := I knew it! It was the Republic, wasn't it!
44524 := [Failure] Enough of these games, human!
44525 := We know about the station and our personnel there! What has happened to them?
44526 := Our what??
44527 := Silence. It will be discussed later.
44528 := Well, human? What REALLY occurred down there?
44529 := [Failure] Your lies only make the hole you dig yourself deeper, human!
44530 := It is likely that you have sabotaged our efforts AND the facilities at the Hrakert Rift. For this you must pay the price.
44531 := How do we know this? What have you been hiding from us? What facilities??
44532 := It is not an issue to be discussed among outsiders.
44533 := No! I demand answers! What has been happening down there?
44534 := Our agreement with the Republic to research and synthesize kolto has nearly borne us disaster. That is all you need to know.
44535 := The Republic... Why were we not informed?
44536 := It was not necessary for you to know. Now keep your silence!
44537 := This we know. What happened there, off-worlder?
44538 := We know??
44539 := They have already attempted to seduce our young away from us... Who's to say they hadn't corrupted someone else?
44540 := [Success] That they could smuggle onto Manaan without our knowing about it? Impossible!
44541 := You fail to realize that if they had such a stealth field, we would not be able to detect them bringing it either.
44542 := But that area is closely monitored... We would have detected any new vessels approaching it just by perturbations in the currents.
44543 := [Success] I find that highly unlikely... How could we have missed such a large undertaking?
44544 := Impossible! Our own sta...
44545 := Our what?
44546 := It is impossible... that's all...
44547 := [Failure] Do not try to manipulate us with your powers, human! You have only one chance left to tell us the truth!
44548 := Enough of these lies!
44549 := If you knew who you were dealing with...
44550 := But I've done nothing wrong!
44551 := You won't get away with this!
44552 := You can't do this!
44553 := I guess you'd find out anyway: the harvesting machinery released a toxin into the water.
44554 := It's not my fault! The harvester malfunctioned!
44555 := Okay, I did it. But you can't do anything to me - I know too much!
44556 := You couldn't kill me if you tried!
44557 := If you ban us, I'll tell that the kolto is destroyed!
44558 := If you ban the Republic, the Sith will take over.
44559 := The entire station had been driven mad.
44560 := [Lie] I have no idea.
44561 := [Lie] The station was empty.
44562 := [Lie] I have no idea.
44563 := You couldn't kill me if you tried!
44564 := [Lie] I really don't know anything.
44565 := Only the Selkath went mad.
44566 := They killed the scientists and the rescue teams the Republic sent down.
44567 := Because they were all insane and had eaten everyone else...
44568 := A giant firaxan shark sent out some sort of psychic call.
44569 := A giant firaxan shark was woken up by the harvester.
44570 := I wanted to kill a giant firaxan shark, so I poisoned it.
44571 := I had no choice.
44572 := The shark had driven everyone mad.
44573 := I vented the toxin into the water.
44574 := [Lie] The Sith were trying to poison the kolto supply!
44575 := [Lie] Maybe some Selkath were helping them.
44576 := I've been lying... It wasn't really the Sith.
44577 := [Lie] I don't know... It was crawling with Sith.
44578 := [Lie] I never actually saw...
44579 := [Lie] I really don't know exactly.
44580 := [Lie] It was the Sith. They poisoned the kolto.
44581 := There were many Selkath down there.
44582 := [Lie] Maybe they have some sort of stealth field.
44583 := [Lie] They had built a station down there already.
44584 := [Force Persuade] The kolto is just fine.
44585 := [Force Persuade] I am telling the truth.
44586 := The explosions were at the research station both our governments set up there.
44587 := [Lie] The harvesting machine malfunctioned and exploded.
44588 := I rigged it to destroy itself.
44589 := I had no choice... but I can offer the data the Republic gained as compensation.
44590 := The entire station had been driven mad.
44591 := [Lie] I have no idea.
44592 := [Lie] The station was empty.
44593 := [Lie] I have no idea.
44594 := You couldn't kill me if you tried!
44595 := [Lie] I really don't know anything.
44596 := Only the Selkath went mad.
44597 := They killed the scientists and the rescue teams the Republic sent down.
44598 := Because they were all insane and had eaten everyone else...
44599 := A giant firaxan shark sent out some sort of psychic call.
44600 := A giant firaxan shark was woken up by the harvester.
44601 := The machinery had woken up a giant firaxan shark.
44602 := The machine was making it drive everyone mad.
44603 := I destroyed the machinery to save it.
44604 := I didn't kill the shark!
44605 := [Lie] The Sith were trying to collapse the Hrakert Rift!
44606 := [Lie] Maybe some Selkath were helping them.
44607 := I've been lying... It wasn't really the Sith.
44608 := [Lie] I don't know... It was crawling with Sith.
44609 := [Lie] I never actually saw...
44610 := [Lie] I really don't know exactly.
44611 := [Lie] It was the Sith. They tried to blow it all up.
44612 := There were many Selkath down there.
44613 := [Lie] Maybe they have some sort of stealth field.
44614 := [Lie] They had built a station down there already.
44615 := [Force Persuade] Nothing happened down at the Rift.
44616 := [Force Persuade] I am telling the truth.
44617 := Your Republic is not in favor with us now, human. You have endangered our livelihood, and this we shall not forget. I have nothing further I wish to say to you.
44618 := There are some of us who would thank you for saving the creature beneath the ocean. While we may not speak of it openly, know that some support your actions.
44619 := We will adjourn to debate your story and the charges brought against you.
44620 := We have reviewed your case and decided that there is not enough evidence to convict you of this crime.
44621 := The provocations of the Sith are well known, and we will be issuing a memo of censure against them. Their Embassy is considered off-limits to all Ahto City Security personnel.
44622 := Let it be noted that the court has taken this new evidence into consideration.
44623 := Hm... This is... most disturbing.
44624 := The court will adjourn for a brief period to verify this evidence and discuss its importance.
44625 := We have verified that this is indeed a Sith datapad indicating their complicity in a plot to overthrow the lawful government of Manaan.
44626 := In gratitude for having discovered this heinous offense, all charges against you regarding this incident will be dropped.
44627 := Pending a suitable penalty against the Sith, their Embassy is considered off-limits to all Ahto City Security personnel.
44628 := No calls or incidents from their base will be attended to until this matter is dealt with, as they are no longer subject to the protections of Selkath law.
44629 := You have been found innocent, and may leave as you desire. This trial is now over.
44630 := For the crimes you have committed against the Sith and against the laws of the Ahto City Civil Authority, this court finds no alternative: We hereby sentence you to death.
44631 := You will be executed immediately. This court has spoken.
44632 := You stand accused of the grievous murder of many Sith, and extensive property damage to their Embassy here.
44633 := How do you plead?
44634 := My client pleads not guilty, your honors.
44635 := What is it, human? You must have a good reason for interrupting our proceedings.
44636 := Enough of these interruptions!
44637 := Is this true? Do you not wish to retain my services?
44638 := Do not mock this court by wasting its time!
44639 := As my client demands, I shall retire.
44640 := As you will.
44641 := I strongly recommend against this course of action...
44642 := You... You are guilty? You admit to your crime?
44643 := Well... Then I suppose we have no choice but to sentence you for your crimes.
44644 := This court will not be mocked!
44645 := Let the record show that this trial has commenced. Presiding are judges Shelkar...
44646 := Jhosa...
44647 := Naleshekan...
44648 := Kota...
44649 := and Duula.
44650 := This trial is to determine the culpability and punishment of this individual in the recent assault on the Sith Embassy.
44651 := Given the severity of this trial, we can dispense with the normal formalities of the court and proceed directly.
44652 := You have pleaded not guilty, yet there were reports of weaponsfire and detonations from within the Sith Embassy.
44653 := You were seen entering and leaving the Embassy. The Sith have not conferred with the authorities about this matter, but from all available evidence, it would seem that you are the source of the disturbance.
44654 := My client was there by circumstance, and was not involved in the disturbance.
44655 := What is it, off-worlder? Do you have something to say regarding your reasons for being there?
44656 := Indeed? Then your Arbiter does not speak for you?
44657 := Enough of these interruptions! Continue, Arbiter.
44658 := Is this true? Do you not wish to retain my services?
44659 := Do not mock this court by wasting its time!
44660 := As my client demands, I shall retire.
44661 := As you will.
44662 := Now, then. What is YOUR explanation for being at the Sith Embassy?
44663 := This is merely a mistake against a person who was there in the wrong place at the wrong time on legitimate business.
44664 := That does not seem likely, Arbiter. The weight of the material evidence, including those items in the defendants possession, is too strong.
44665 := What legitimate business was your client involved in at the Sith Embassy?
44666 := The business of the Jedi Order, of course. My client, as noted on the entry transcript, is a member of said Order.
44667 := What is it, Jedi? Or are you not a member of that Order?
44668 := Enough of these interruptions! Continue, Arbiter.
44669 := You are not a Jedi? You come to this court under false pretenses??
44670 := My client is not rational at the moment. Please disregard these statements.
44671 := It is quite obvious what your client is, Arbiter! A murderer, as well as a liar!
44672 := Is this true? Do you not wish to retain my services?
44673 := Do not mock this court by wasting its time!
44674 := As my client demands, I shall retire.
44675 := As you will.
44676 := Now, then. What is YOUR explanation for being at the Sith Embassy?
44677 := As a member of this Order, my client is above reproach. A Jedi would not have murdered so many out of spite.
44678 := The Order is involved in a war with the Sith. A very messy war. It is not unreasonable that some fanatic would seek to bring that war here.
44679 := My client is not a fanatic!
44680 := Like a Suba pod waiting to strike when it hatches no doubt...
44681 := Please, your honor, that is unfair...
44682 := Enough! We have heard enough.
44683 := Your explanation is not good enough, Arbiter. You have failed. There is more than enough evidence to convict this criminal.
44684 := Please, your honors! My client... my client is mentally incompetent and unable to form complex thoughts. Please, I throw my client on the mercy of the court!
44685 := Your client is not so incompetent as that, Arbiter.
44686 := Enough of these interruptions!
44687 := The court does not dispense in mercy, only justice! Your client will be sentenced according to our laws and tradition!
44688 := You stand accused of the grievous murder of many Sith, and extensive property damage to their Embassy here.
44689 := How do you plead?
44690 := We will not tolerate insolence! You will obey the rules of our court, or you will be summarily found guilty!
44691 := You... You are guilty? You admit to your crime?
44692 := You wouldn't!
44693 := I wouldn't doubt the human... they are known for these double-dealings...
44694 := Kolto is the lifeblood of Manaan. Our entire economy and independence rests upon it. Now that it is gone we must maintain a perilous pact secrecy with your Republic.
44695 := We can NOT afford to jeporadize that secrecy. Not for anything.
44696 := If we allow you to leave, you are a threat and a liability to the Selkath people. Therefore we cannot.
44697 := Your secret will die with you, off-worlder.
44698 := Well... Then I suppose we have no choice but to sentence you for your crimes.
44699 := This court will not be mocked!
44700 := Let the record show that this trial has commenced. Presiding are judges Shelkar...
44701 := Jhosa...
44702 := Naleshekan...
44703 := Kota...
44704 := and Duula.
44705 := This trial is to determine the culpability and punishment of this individual in the recent assault on the Sith Embassy.
44706 := Given the severity of this trial, we can dispense with the normal formalities of the court and proceed directly.
44707 := You have pleaded not guilty, yet there were reports of weaponsfire and detonations from within the Sith Embassy.
44708 := You were seen entering and leaving the Embassy. The Sith have not conferred with the authorities about this matter, but from all available evidence, it would seem that you are the source of the disturbance.
44709 := What is your explanation for being in the Sith Embassy?
44710 := You were clearly seen entering the Sith base. You cannot deny this fact!
44711 := You must have had some reason for entering. What was it, human?
44712 := See! I knew that the off-worlder was guilty! They all are!
44713 := What... what possible reason could you have to justify your actions?
44714 := That does not excuse your actions! The neutrality and laws of Manaan WILL be upheld!
44715 := You admit to your crime!
44716 := You believe that the Sith have had something to do with those disappearance?
44717 := The off-worlder has probably been listening to Shaelas and his rumor-mongering.
44718 := Most likely. Do you have any proof to back up your assumption, human? Have the Sith been implicated?
44719 := You will need to come up with a better excuse than that, off-worlder!
44720 := I recognize that token! It is from Galas, one of the youths who went missing!
44721 := You found that in their Embassy?!
44722 := The Sith HAVE been taking them!
44723 := The court will adjourn for a brief period to verify this evidence and discuss its importance.
44724 := We have verified that this token was indeed from Galas indicating the complicity of the Sith in the disappearances of our young.
44725 := In gratitude for having discovered this heinous offense, all charges against you regarding this incident will be dropped.
44726 := Pending a suitable penalty against the Sith, their Embassy is considered off-limits to all Ahto City Security personnel.
44727 := No calls or incidents from their base will be attended to until this matter is dealt with, as they are no longer subject to the protections of Selkath law.
44728 := You have been found innocent, and may leave as you desire. This trial is now over.
44729 := You were working for the Republic? So the Republic had you break in and kill the Sith? It is as I suspected...
44730 := Do not jump to conclusions.
44731 := Why did the Republic have you enter the Sith Embassy?
44732 := It is good that you are looking out for the joint interests of the Republic and Manaan in this issue, but was is really necessary to take such extreme measures?
44733 := Station? What station?
44734 := This is a internal matter for Selkath alone! We will adjourn immediately to discuss these things without the interference of outsiders!
44735 := Upon review of this case, we find that there is no basis for a case against the defendant.
44736 := Additionally, the Sith will receive a censure for provoking combat within Ahto City.
44737 := The secret must be kept from the Sith, no matter the cost!
44738 := Indeed. We will adjourn to discuss the situation and the charges brought against you.
44739 := One crime does not permit the use of another to set it right!
44740 := You have willfully and blatantly broken our laws, and for that you shall be sentenced accordingly!
44741 := You admit that you enetered the Sith base illegally and attempted to commit crimes there!
44742 := It is obvious that they tried to stop you and that you initiated hostilities!
44743 := So like an off-worlder...
44744 := I am skeptical of this assertion... but it does seem in the character of the Sith to reneg on their commitments.
44745 := There have been many provocations before this! Their character is well known!
44746 := Indeed, but that is not an issue for outsiders to hear.
44747 := Indeed. I am most skeptical of this statement.
44748 := But it may be true... How was it they lured you inside? What bait did they use?
44749 := Offered you a job? To a Jedi?
44750 := Unlikely... but possible. How then, did the fighting start?
44751 := You... attacked them?!
44752 := I knew the off-worlder was a danger!
44753 := Preposterous!
44754 := That does sound like something the Sith would do...
44755 := I am inclined to believe the off-worlder.
44756 := This mystical darkside you Jedi keep speaking of is a convenient excuse. Basically, they wished to hire you away from the Republic.
44757 := How, then, did the fighting start?
44758 := While your high standing among the off-worlders on Manaan may bring you some leniency from them, being a successful swoop rider brings you no credit here, human.
44759 := Your past experience as Arbiter in the Sunry case may aid in your defence now, human, but you must do a better job yourself, given the crimes you are faced with.
44760 := The familiarity you gained in your successful defence of Sunry will aid you here, human. But the charges you are faced with are far more grave.
44761 := While you have proven the Sith to manipulative and deceitful in their activities here on Manaan, I believe you will have a much harder time defending your actions now. Some things go too far, off-worlder.
44762 := The Sith have been using and manipulating the young among our race; we know this. It is up to us to decide what actions we should take, not vigilante justice by some human.
44763 := While your... special position bears heavily on our minds, we cannot ignore the blatancy with which you have violated our laws.
44764 := Greetings, human. I am called Bwa'lass, and I have been selected as your Arbiter for the duration of your trial.
44765 := The question of your freedom will be up to the court to decide. All I can do as Arbiter is attempt to sway their decision in your favor.
44766 := You have been charged with initiating violence within the Sith Embassy, murdering members of the Ambassadorial Commission of the Sith Empire, and disregarding our own laws regarding violence in Ahto City.
44767 := Be that as it may, I doubt the judges share your view. I will endeavor, however, to make them see your point, off-worlder.
44768 := While it is true that you do have that right, I would recommend against it. Due to your confinement, you have not had much of a chance to build up evidence to pursue your case.
44769 := Also, I do not believe you off-worlders truly understand the minds of we Selkath. It would be best if you left your defence up to me.
44770 := I would first like to ask you a few questions regarding the events that led up to your arrest.
44771 := I have already been given all relevant data on you and your companions, so that can be disregarded. For what reason did you enter the Sith Embassy?
44772 := Illegal acts seem to be a common occurance among you off-worlders. I am not terribly surprised by your actions, but the judges will want to hear a little more convincing reason.
44773 := What is your prior association with the Sith?
44774 := I am... humbled by your candor. While I'm sure that you yourself see that as a noble sentiment, I doubt that those assigning your sentence will be so generous.
44775 := The Sith are an expansionistic power, true, and at war with the Republic. You may make it your personal mission to foil them, but the authorities take a dim view of it taking place here.
44776 := I think you will need a more thorough explanation in order to convince the judges.
44777 := That should be all the information I require of you, for now. If you wish, we can begin the trial whenever you are ready.
44778 := Indeed? And what is that?
44779 := You must share the evidence with me before I can release you and we can proceed to the courtroom.
44780 := This is most... disturbing. We should take this evidence and present it before the court right away.
44781 := While that is your right, I strongly recommend against it. I am versed in all the necessary particulars of this case and Selkath law, off-worlder. You would do well to heed my advice.
44782 := You off-worlders are not known for your mental prowess. I shall leave your demise up to you.
44783 := Very well, we shall proceed to the courtroom.
44784 := I have all the information I need. We should proceed now, the judges are waiting.
44785 := I think this trial is relatively straight forward. It should be obvious to the judges what has transpired.
44786 := I am skeptical of that, as will be the judges. You off-worlders tend to congregate much amongst yourself. I see no inherent differences between your two groups.
44787 := Indeed... Since you have a passcard to their base, I can only assume you believe taking this route would lessen your sentence... Very well.
44788 := Indeed. I find that unlikely, off-worlder, but perhaps the judges will be more sympathetic to your view.
44789 := Indeed... That would explain the reason a passcard for entry was found on your person.
44790 := Yes, Arbiter. The one who defends you before the judges of the Selkath people.
44791 := I will endeavor to prove to them that you are not guilty of the heinous crimes that you are accused of, off-worlder.
44792 := [Interrupt.]
44793 := Never mind.
44794 := I have this datapad as proof that the Sith are up to no good!
44795 := I wish to dismiss my Arbiter.
44796 := Go away, bottom-feeder!
44797 := I reconsidered. You may continue.
44798 := I will defend myself.
44799 := I'm guilty!
44800 := It was a lot of fun, really.
44801 := Er... no... I was just kidding.
44802 := Yes.
44803 := [Allow him to continue.]
44804 := [Interrupt.]
44805 := That is not why I was there!
44806 := Never mind.
44807 := I have this datapad as proof that the Sith are up to no good!
44808 := I wish to dismiss my Arbiter.
44809 := Go away, bottom-feeder!
44810 := I reconsidered. You may continue.
44811 := I will defend myself.
44812 := [Allow him to continue.]
44813 := [Interrupt.]
44814 := Never mind.
44815 := I'm not really a Jedi!
44816 := I have this datapad as proof that the Sith are up to no good!
44817 := I wish to dismiss my Arbiter.
44818 := Go away, bottom-feeder!
44819 := I reconsidered. You may continue.
44820 := I will defend myself.
44821 := [Allow him to continue.]
44822 := [Interrupt.]
44823 := Never mind.
44824 := [Allow him to continue.]
44825 := I'm innocent!
44826 := No! I am a Republic citizen!
44827 := I don't plead! I tell!
44828 := Guilty.
44829 := If you try to punish me, I'll let everyone know that the kolto is gone.
44830 := It was a lot of fun, really.
44831 := Er... no... I was just kidding.
44832 := Yes.
44833 := Not guilty.
44834 := It was just a coincidence.
44835 := I was killing Sith. See? Simple.
44836 := The Republic ordered me to go into their base.
44837 := The Sith are a blight upon the galaxy!
44838 := They needed killing.
44839 := I was investigating the disappearances of young Selkath.
44840 := Er... well, no...
44841 := I found this token on a dead Selkath inside the Sith base.
44842 := I was working for the Republic.
44843 := To stop them from learning about the secret base by the Hrakert Rift.
44844 := They had almost found out about the station.
44845 := To retrieve data the Sith had stolen.
44846 := To steal information.
44847 := I was there for diplomatic negotiations.
44848 := The Sith lured me inside.
44849 := They offered me a job.
44850 := I felt like showing them who was boss.
44851 := They tried to double-cross me.
44852 := I refused and they attacked.
44853 := They were secretly trying to lure me to the darkside.
44854 := Get me out of here!
44855 := What have I been charged with?
44856 := It's all the Sith's fault!
44857 := What can I do?
44858 := I don't need anyone to represent me!
44859 := How will you get me free?
44860 := I... er... broke in.
44861 := I kill them wherever I can find them.
44862 := I'm on a mission to stop them from taking over the galaxy.
44863 := I have proof that the Sith are evil.
44864 := I'll show it to the judges, or no one!
44865 := This datapad proving they are kidnapping young Selkath.
44866 := I think I'd rather represent myself.
44867 := I said no, fish-head!
44868 := Fine, represent me.
44869 := No, I'll represent myself.
44870 := Let's get the trial started.
44871 := Um... Don't you need to ask more questions?
44872 := How can you expect to defend me without getting more information?
44873 := I have no prior association.
44874 := I had authorization to enter.
44875 := I was invited.
44876 := Arbiter?
44877 := You have been charged with violations of the Ahto City laws. Your role in our recent troubles is not to be forgotten either, human. The fine is 500 credits.
44878 := You have been charged with violations of the Ahto City laws. Your incident with the Sith has not been forgotten either, human. The fine is 500 credits.
44879 := Greetings, human. While the Sith have suffered setbacks here on Manaan and their goods are in short supply, you can rest assured that I will always have what you need.
44880 := Greetings, human. In these troubled times with difficulties between the Republic and our government here, know that you can always find the goods you need with me.
44881 := The Selkath people thank you for exposing the Sith plots here on Manaan. When our leaders decide a fitting punishment, they will certainly know our displeasure.
44882 := If there is anything else you wish to bring to my attention, you have my permission to ask.
44883 := A Star Map? Hm... not precisely... but Manaan holds many wonderous and exciting locales and treasures, kolto not the least of them.
44884 := Our many shops and boulevards cater to the whim of any species and provide a vibrant night-life that has to be seen to be believed.
44885 := This and other tourist paraphenalia can be had from your local embassy... So do not waste my time with it.
44886 := While we are not free to discuss the... incident, we remember your involvement in it quite well.
44887 := What is it you wish to bring to my attention?
44888 := Then go and enjoy Ahto City. And do not break any laws that we would have to lock you up for.
44889 := The court is unaware of any missing beings reports. Should any substantial evidence come up in regards to such a disappearance, you should file it with us and an investigation will be launched.
44890 := Is there anything else you require?
44891 := Is there a Star Map on this world?
44892 := I have no more questions, your honor.
44893 := What do you know about the young Selkath who have been going missing?
44894 := Greetings, human. My name is Shaelas. I have heard that you may have had some part in the incident at the Sith Embassy recently. Is this true?
44895 := [Success] Yes... A joke. I was mistaken.
44896 := [Failure] I do not believe you! Go. We have nothing more to speak of.
44897 := [Success] I do not find that form of humor amusing, human!
44898 := Your actions beneath the surface have shown that you are no friend to my people. I wish nothing to do with you.
44899 := Whatever...
44900 := [Force Persuade] It was a joke.

44929 := We know that you have some connection with the souring of relations between our government and the Republic. Whatever your Republic may be up to, we Selkath shall find out!
44930 := The Sith Embassy has been struck by some sort of attack recently, although they won't say what it was. Perhaps the war has come here after all...
44931 := I have heard of relations souring between our peoples, human. I hope this does not continue for long...
44932 := You there! Human! You are placed under the arrest of the Ahto City Civil Authority!
44933 := Do not be foolish, human! We have the entire armed forces of Manaan at our disposal. You WILL submit to our authority!
44934 := Though the Sith Embassy here is considered sovereign territory of the Sith Empire, we have been monitoring an alarming number of weapon discharges and detonations from within the base.
44935 := Inquiries to the staff of the Embassy yielded no response. It would seem that contact had been cut.
44936 := Our external monitors recorded you entering the base shortly before contact was lost and fighting aparently began.
44937 := Our cameras recorded you entering the base shortly before contact was lost and fighting apparently began.
44938 := It is the conclusion of the Ahto City Civil Authority that you are responsible for the disturbance here, and you are hereby placed under arrest. You will come with us to await your trial.
44939 := As material witnesses, the individuals who accompany you will be detained at your vessel, and the vessel itself prohibited from leaving Manaan.
44940 := We will leave. Now. Do not attempt to resist, or we shall resort to overwhelming force.
44941 := You'll never take me alive!
44942 := I have done nothing wrong.
44943 := What? Why?
44944 := We are watching you off-worlder... We know that you have had some influence in recent events...
44945 := We are watching you off-worlder... We know that you have had some influence in recent events...
44946 := We are watching you off-worlder... We know that you have had some influence in recent events...
44947 := Greetings, Sector Champion. You have proven to be a spectacular racer, even defeating Queedle's improved time.
44948 := Welcome once again, human. Is there something I can do for you?
44949 := Greetings, human. Have you come here to watch the swoop races? I find they are an excellent way to relieve stress. And in my business, I need all the stress relief I can get.
44950 := I enjoy watching you on the track. You are good, for a human. Your runs are a nice diversion when the stress of my business becomes too much for me.
44951 := Congratulations on winning the Manaan championship. I do enjoy watching your races, human. It makes a nice break from the hectic world I must deal with everyday in my business.
44952 := Then I shall return my attention to the track. Goodbye, human.
44953 := My name is Vek. I work for Ithorak Guldar, a merchant who deals in very rare and expensive art. He serves as the go-between for buyers and sellers throughout the galaxy.
44954 := I serve as Ithorak's security advisor - a highly demanding job. The fact that Ithorak seems to delight in insulting and berating me makes it even more difficult.
44955 := You can't even begin to imagine how hard it is dealing with the galaxy's cultural elite. They're like spoiled children, throwing tantrums whenever they don't get their way.
44956 := And Ithorak is the worst of them all! 'You idiot, Vek!' 'How could you be so stupid, Vek!' He thinks my job is easy, but I'd like to see where he'd be without me!
44957 := I'm... I'm sorry for that outburst. I come here to relax, but just talking about work is making me tense. So allow me to wish you a civil 'good day' so I can get back to watching the racers.
44958 := To be honest, no. Not really. I just wear this uniform to gain respect. People are less likely to give me trouble if they think I *might* be with the Sith.
44959 := Well, maybe. I guess. But the Sith here on Manaan aren't about to do anything to get them in trouble. Not if it means getting sanctions against their Kolto shipments.
44960 := As long as I don't actually *say* I'm with the Sith, they don't seem to mind. So I use this outfit to give me the psychological edge I need. Being Ithorak's security advisor isn't easy!
44961 := You need to meet with Ithorak? Forgive my skepticism, but you hardly resemble our typical client. We deal in the kind of pieces found in the chambers of a galactic senator.
44962 := Hmph! Now I *know* you aren't the type of person we want to deal with. Your threats mean nothing to me: I once had a planetary amabassador threaten to have me executed on the spot!
44963 := But I knew she couldn't touch me, and I know you can't do anything to me here on Manaan. Not without having half of Ahto City's security force coming down on you.
44964 := [Success] Yes, you do have that look about you; the air of one who serves the rich and powerful. Servile, fawning... a look I have seen in my own mirror far too often. *sigh* 
44965 := Very well, I'll set up a meeting with my boss. The Sith permit Ithorak to conduct his private business in their non-secured hangar. Go to the docking bays and we will meet you there.
44966 := [Failure] Perhaps you do, human. But how can I be sure you're telling the truth? I would hate to waste Ithorak's time if you aren't serious.
44967 := Yes, that does show a serious level of commitment. Whoever you represent must be quite wealthy, if they have authorized this kind of payment just so you can see Ithorak.
44968 := Take your blustering threats somewhere else, human. Ithorak has no desire to meet with you!
44969 := Goodbye, human.
44970 := Your apology is accepted, human. I understand that intimidation can be useful at times. On someone of lesser character it might even have worked.
44971 := But even though I don't hold any ill will towards you, I'm afraid you still can't meet with Ithorak. As I said before, you are not the kind of client we normally take on.
44972 := I'll be going now.
44973 := What do you do again?
44974 := Who are you again?
44975 := What is your business, exactly?
44976 := Who are you?
44977 := Your job doesn't sound that hard to me.
44978 := Yes, I can see how it would be very stressful.
44979 := You're wearing a Sith uniform. Are you with the Sith?
44980 := Don't you think the Sith might take exception to that?
44981 := I need to meet with Ithorak Gulder. Can you set it up?
44982 := Never mind. I'll just go instead.
44983 := Unless you want the Manaan authorities to find your body floating in the ocean, you'll set up this meeting!
44984 := [Force Persuade] I represent a wealthy buyer from Coruscant.
44985 := [Persuade] I represent an anonymous buyer from Coruscant.
44986 := Here's 500 credits to set up the meeting. That should prove I'm serious.
44987 := Goodbye.
44988 := I'm sorry about the threat. I didn't mean anything by it.
44989 := Come in human, please. The Selkath have been very sensitive lately. I believe something has happened between them and the Republic, but I am not certain.
44990 := Certainly, though, with the new tension, business has dropped off a bit. Please, what can I do for you today?
44991 := Welcome, human. While I am not one to condone violence, I find it extremely pleasing that someone has finally stood up to the Sith and dealt with them in their own Embassy!
44992 := I doubt they will be driven from the planet, but any harm they suffer brings me joy. So, what can I do for you on this joyous day, human?
44993 := What do YOU want? If you aren't a racer, you're nobody, so just leave me alone.
44994 := Wow! You're, like, sooo great! I can't believe you actually spoke to me. Like, wow!
44995 := Hey, you're not bad... maybe if you win a couple races, I might be glad to have talked to you.

45022 := Can we play a practice game?
45023 := [Play Pazaak Tutorial]
45024 := Sure. Let's play.
45025 := The Sith have been the target of some sort of attack recently... If the Republic was behind this, they will face stiff penalties.
45026 := The Sith have been cruelly sabotaged... We  will track down the culprits who have disobeyed our laws and punish them severely!
45027 := Your Republic has provoked us too much! Surely our government will punish the Republic for attempting to harm us!
45028 := The Sith Embassy was invaded I hear... I wonder who could be capable of doing that...
45029 := There have been disturbances resulting from some sort of breach between our government and your Republic. This does not bode well...
45030 := You have endangered the Sith Embassy, and I shall not let you endanger our shipping as well! Leave here now, or I will be forced to call Security.
45031 := Your actions have threatened our world and our way of life. You are not welcome in this place, human, no matter what you have arranged with our leaders.
45032 := We are not shipping kolto right now, human, and escpecially not to you! You will leave here now, or I will be forced to call Security.
45033 := You kind is too disruptive and agressive to speak to, human. We have heard of the incident at the Sith Embassy and wish no further disruptions here.
45034 := You are not welcome here, human. You have threatened our world with your actions and I have no wish to speak to you.
45035 := You are not welcome here, human. You have disrupted our production severely and I have no wish to speak to you.
45036 := Welcome to Manaan. There will be a docking fee of 500 credits to access Ahto City at this time.
45037 := You have been deemed disruptive to Ahto City trade. If you wish to enter, you must pay our fees.
45038 := [Failure] You... you try to manipulate my mind off-worlder! We do not tolerate such insolence and disrespect for authority here on Manaan!
45039 := You shall be detained and fined no less than 500 credits for this offence. If you cannot pay such a fine then you will rot in prison.
45040 := [Success] Ah. I see. Yes, you do not need to pay.
45041 := *whisper* The Force is not a thing to be trifled with. Continue to use it frivolously and you may find yourself straying down the dark path.[R1]
45042 := *whisper* You should treat your power with respect, not use the Force on a whim like it is some toy![R1]
45043 := *whisper* The Jedi Council wouldn't approve, but they always were a little stodgy about using the Force on people. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.[R1]
45044 := *whisper* I can be pretty convincing when I have to be, but that mind trick is something else![R1]
45045 := The Manaan board of trade and tourism thanks you, off-worlder. Here is a visitor guide and map to the city. Refer to it should you have any questions. 
45046 := The gates of Ahto city are now open to you. You may come and go as you please, so long as you do not leave the planet. If you do, you will have to pay the docking fee once more.
45047 := 500 credits? It used to be 100!
45048 := [Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the docking fee.
45049 := Very well. Here is the docking fee.

45053 := Are you the buyer I'm supposed to meet?  Wait a minute: where's Vek? What's going on here!
45054 := I knew I couldn't trust that Twi'lek. Some security advisor: he lets an assassin walk right in on me!
45055 := Vek's going to pay for this betrayal... after I'm done taking care of you!
45056 := Vek didn't want to be around when I gutted you, Ithorak!
45057 := Vek's not on your payroll anymore, Ithorak!
45058 := Ithorak is waiting for you inside the hangar. As you probably know, there are no security cameras there: the better to conduct our business away from prying eyes.
45059 := However, before we go in I'll point out this rather large assault droid standing beside me. I and the droid will both accompany you in to see Ithorak, just to make sure there is no trouble.
45060 := Excellent. Follow me.
45061 := Greetings, human. I am Ithorak. Vek tells me you represent a wealthy buyer, and I am always interested in new clients. So tell me, who do you represent?
45062 := Vek, you idiot! What kind of security advisor are you? You lead this assassin right to me!
45063 := I... I'm sorry, Ithorak. I just thought...
45064 := Shut up, Vek! Just do your job and kill them!
45065 := I happen to know the art acquisitions agent working on behalf of the Organa family quite well, and you are definitly not her! Vek may be a blind fool, but I know an assassin when I see one!
45066 := Oh? I don't like not knowing who I'm working for, but exceptions can sometimes be made.  Well, if you won't reveal your patron, at least tell me what pieces of art they're interested in.
45067 := One does not "browse" the types of items I deal in! You may have fooled my moron of a security advisor, but you don't fool me! You're an assassin!
45068 := Ithorak is an important man with access to the rich and powerful. He is not about to let himself become an easy target for a kidnapping or an assassination.
45069 := When you meet Ithorak, I and the droid will both be there. It is my job to protect my employer, and I intend to do that regardless of my personal feelings toward him.
45070 := Ithorak can be as tempermental as his clients. Combine that with his arrogance and the way he treats his underlings and you can understand why I might soon consider seeking other employment.
45071 := But despite all Ithorak's faults, he does pay well. So I serve my employer faithfully, for now.
45072 := [Success] You're... you're right. He's never treated me with the respect I deserve. Yelling at me, insulting me, belittling me. I don't know why I stayed with him as long as I did!
45073 := Ithorak never appreciated me while I was around, so let's see how he likes dealing with you alone! But before I go, one last warning, human.
45074 := Whatever your plan for Ithorak is, be careful. I've always suspected he was more than just a simple merchant. I've heard people who cross him are rarely heard from again.
45075 := I don't want to risk his vengeance, so I'm going to disappear for a long while. Just in case Ithorak gets the better of you in this, you understand. Goodbye, human... and good luck.
45076 := [Success] 500 credits to betray Ithorak? 500 credits to abandon the man who insults and belittles me on a daily basis? How could I refuse such a generous offer?
45077 := Okay, let's go in and see Ithorak.
45078 := I'm just here to kill you, Ithorak!
45079 := Uh... I represent the Organa family from Alderaan.
45080 := My buyer wishes to remain anonymous.
45081 := Nothing specific. I'm just browsing on behalf of my patron.
45082 := You don't need to do that. I won't cause any trouble.
45083 := Personal feelings? Do you mean you don't like Ithorak?
45084 := [Force Persuade] You should quit on him right now. Leave and find another job.
45085 := [Persuade] What if I gave you 500 credits *not* to protect him?
45086 := My business with Ithorak is private.
45087 := [This unsavory looking man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.]
45088 := [Now that Ithorak is dead, you have no further use for this droid. Someone will probably remove it in time.]
45089 := [This assault droid must have been programmed to respond to Vek's commands. Now that he's gone, it isn't doing much of anything.]
45090 := [You leave the droid alone. Someone will probably be by to remove it in time.]
45091 := Leave the droid alone.
45092 := Reprogram the droid.
45093 := You've accessed the droid's primary circuits to reprogram it.
45094 := You decide not to reprogram the droid.
45095 := [Success] It's deadly payload in place, the droid marches towards Ithorak.
45096 := [Failure] You do not have enough repair parts.
45097 := [Success] The droid marches off to attack Ithorak. 
45098 := Leave it alone.
45099 := Rig the droid with a frag mine and program it to approach Ithorak and detonate. (<CUSTOM43> repair part(s))
45100 := Program the droid to attack Ithorak. (<CUSTOM45> repair part(s))
45101 := You are not welcome in this city anymore, human, but we cannot deny you entry either.  Therefore, I am obliged to treat you as I do my other customers.
45102 := You are not welcome in this city anymore, human, but we cannot deny you entry either.  Therefore, I am obliged to treat you as I do my other customers.
45103 := How is it that the Ahto City Provisional Company can help you today?
45104 := Rest assured that as long as Manaan is here, the Ahto City Provisional Company will be here to serve your needs. Good day to you, sentient.
45105 := Of course. The Ahto City Visitor's Provisional Stand is here to service you, the customer.
45106 := Manaan is the homeworld of we Selkath. It is here that our race has lived and thrived for uncounted millenia. With our valuable supply of kolto, we have become an important player in intragalactic politics.
45107 := We have taken a neutral stance in the current galactic war between the Sith and the Republic as we believe that violence is not a permanent solution.
45108 := Is there another way in which I can assist you?
45109 := Ahto City is the center of trade and commerce for all of Manaan. Indeed, for this entire sector! It is the only known source of kolto in the galaxy, and thus one of its most important worlds.
45110 := This city was constructed by we Selkath so that other races and cultures could experience the wonders that Manaan has to offer.
45111 := Nothing for now.
45112 := I would like to sell you something.
45113 := Let me see your inventory.
45114 := Tell me about Manaan.
45115 := Tell me about Ahto City.
45116 := I will be leaving now.
45117 := What is this? What's going on here?

45139 := You return. Was our business so unfinished when we last spoke? What is it you want?
45140 := You have forgotten my name? Knowledge is power, but information is useless if you do not make a point to remember it. I am Hulas, a traveler from the world of Duro.
45141 := Senni Vek? This name means nothing to me. Are you certain this person told you and your companions to come and see me? That is very strange.
45142 := Obviously there must be some mistake. Or maybe this is a joke. I doubt anyone named 'Senni Vek' told you to bring your companions and come speak with me.
45143 := Genoharadan? That word means nothing to me. If you want to speak like a fool, you should at least have the sense not to do it in front of others. 
45144 := I believe we should end this discussion, before you embarrass yourself further in front of your friends.
45145 := Senni did not think you would come, but I knew better, <FullName>. It is good that you have come alone, for if you ever come with others I will not speak to you of these things.
45146 := I am Hulas of the Genoharadan - a secret society of bounty hunters. For a thousand generations we have existed, but always hidden beneath an impenetrable veil.
45147 := Few ever have. We are shadow, darkness and night. We are less than a whisper or a thought. We have managed to keep our existence a secret far longer than most could ever imagine.
45148 := If you are ever foolish enough to tell anyone about this meeting or the Genoharadan's existence, they would not believe you. They would probably think you were paranoid, or mentally unstable.
45149 := Not even those closest to you can know we have approached you. If you ever speak to me around any of your companions, I will not discuss the Genoharadan. Do you understand, <FullName>?
45150 := If you do not comply, then this opportunity will be lost. Most people have never heard of the Genoharadan. They never see us, never know we are there, do not even know we exist.
45151 := If you do not follow our rules, I will leave and you will be like the others. You will never see us again. The Genoharadan will be nothing but a figment of your imagination.
45152 := If you swear to keep our existence a secret you will learn of a a forbidden soceity known only to a handful throughout the galaxy. If not, we will simply vanish. The choice is yours.
45153 := As you wish. Then this is the last you will see of me, or any of the Genoharadan. Farewell, <FullName>.
45154 := Excellent, <FullName>. We have high hopes for you within the guild... if you prove yourself worthy. Listen closely and I will give you a first glimpse into our secret world.
45155 := We Genoharadan are an ancient guild of elite bounty hunters. For thousands of years we have been at work throughout the galaxy, eliminating our targets in near total secrecy.
45156 := In the highest corridors of power a handful of people know we exist, and how to contact us. Of course, these people are smart enough to keep this knowledge a carefully guarded secret.
45157 := And on very rare occasions, when we are seeking new clients, one of our guild-masters will approach a powerful political figure and offer our services when the time is ripe.
45158 := By killing Calo Nord, you have shown you have great potential. The Genoharadan could use someone like you, if you are willing. And your work for us could be of great aid to the Republic.
45159 := The Genoharadan have a vested interest in preserving the Republic. It is the perfect cover for our work. We operate behind the scenes, manipulating events through subtle machinations.
45160 := Do you think the Republic has persisted for 15,000 years by mere accident? If not for our influence - distasteful as our methods may be to some - the Republic would have collapsed long ago!
45161 := We understand the bureaucracy of the Republic, we have learned how to alter the course of political events under the existing regime. We have no wish to see the Republic fall.
45162 := As I said earlier, your efforts here will help the Republic. And by aiding us you will earn the right to join an exclusive organization with the power to alter the very course of galactic history.
45163 := And of course there is the simplest reason of all: the Genoharadan reward their agents very, very well.
45164 := As you can imagine, joining the Genoharadan is not a simple process. To begin, we will need proof of your loyalty and your competence.
45165 := When you feel you are ready, I will give you a task: a target who must be eliminated. Of course you will have to come alone whenever you wish to discuss Genoharadan business.
45166 := That is one of the reasons our existence has remained secret for so long. Nobody wants to believe in a secret society manipulating and controlling events on a grand scale.
45167 := Rumors and hints of our existence are dismissed as paranoid fantasies. But we do exist, <FullName>. And we have come to ask you to join us.
45168 := Innocent people? Our victims are far from innocent, and the Genoharadan will only accept a contract if the target's death suits our greater goals - goals that often match those of the Republic.
45169 := The Genoharadan are far from common! Even Calo Nord hadn't proven himself worthy of joining our guild, though he was getting close. Until he met you, that is.
45170 := I believe you speak the truth, <FullName>. But remember this: if you ever betray us, this opportunity will be lost forever.
45171 := Few among the galaxy have ever heard of the Genoharadan. They never see us, never know we are there. They do not even know we exist.
45172 := If you do not follow our rules, we will vanish and you will be like all the others. You will never see us again. We will be nothing but a figment of your imagination.
45173 := But if you swear to keep the secrets of our order, you will learn of a forbidden society known only to a handful throughout the galaxy.
45174 := Welcome back, <FullName>. I see you have come alone, this is good. I assume you are here to discuss the business of the Genoharadan.
45175 := I will be waiting here for you, <FullName>. The Genoharadan are eager to see the extent of your abilities.
45176 := You must understand that there is much I cannot tell you until you are accepted into the guild, of course. But ask your questions and I will tell you what I can.
45177 := Some of the wise Masters have knowledge of our existence. Those who study galactic history carefully will see evidence of our influence throughout.  
45178 := But it is unlikely that even the Jedi know the true scope of our power and influence. They permit us to exist because they see us as a minor faction in the galaxy; one of many.
45179 := Still, we try to avoid crossing paths with the Order. The Jedi are powerful and difficult to manipulate. We are careful to avoid actions that would draw their full attention.
45180 := Despite their wisdom, the Jedi are in many ways like everyone else. They would not believe the true extent of our secret society even if you were to tell them.
45181 := Malak is no easy target, even for the Genoharadan. He is far too visible a figure. We prefer to operate on the fringes of events, not plunge into their center.
45182 := In any case, there is no guarantee that the Genoharadan would eliminate Malak even if we could. Not yet. He may someday be of use to us, depending how events play out.
45183 := Right now we support the Republic, but the goals of our guild are many and our methods subtle. At times we intervene in wars, but often we prefer to remain behind the scenes.
45184 := We have found it more effective to let the grand scope of events play themselves out, then manipulate the situation to our advantage. It is one of the keys to keeping our existence well hidden.
45185 := The Genoharadan were created by the the galactic tyrant Xim the Despot, five thousand years before the Republic itself was even founded.
45186 := During Xim's short but brutal reign he used Genoharadan agents to eliminate his most powerful enemies. When Xim was finally overthrown, it was believed the Genoharadan disbanded.
45187 := But the Genoharadan did not disband. Instead, we vanished into the darkness. Now we carry on our work from the deepest shadows, dispatching the enemies of those who hire us.
45188 := I'm sorry, <FullName>, but I am not ready to reveal all our secrets to you yet. Perhaps after you have completed another of your missions I will tell you more of this.
45189 := In the first few centuries after Xim was overthrown, the Genoharadan were nothing but hired killers. We were a mere tool to be used by those who were rich and politically ambitious
45190 := But slowly the guild evolved. We began to shape and alter events through our actions. We ceased to be a servant of the political elite; we became a powerful faction in our own right.
45191 := The organizaton of the guild itself also changed at this point. Instead of a single guildmaster, it was decided there would be four Overseers to guide and lead the Genoharadan.
45192 := By distributing the power in this way we were protected against becoming a tool of a single person. The Overseers' individual ambitions would serve to balance each other out.
45193 := The Overseers are a secret cabal of four individuals who control the Genoharadan. For their own protection, nobody knows the identity of an Overseer. They are anonymous even to each other.
45194 := Through agents and go-betweens, the Overseers consult with each other on all guild business. The system ensures no one person can manipulate the guild for their own benefit.
45195 := As you can imagine, the method for choosing and replacing an Overseer is complicated. The anonymity of a candidate must be protected at all costs, or the entire system will break down.
45196 := If one Overseer were ever able to somehow eliminate the other three at the same time, he could seize all the power for himself and the guild as we know it would change forever.
45197 := More than this I cannot tell you, for the sake of the guild. Besides, many of the details are hidden from me, as well. They are known only to the Overseers themselves.
45198 := Yes, I heard he met a rather grisly end. For completing this mission you have earned another reward. Take these Genoharadan gloves. You will find they are very useful in battle.
45199 := By disposing of Ithorak you bring yourself ever closer to being accepted into the Genoharadan. But you must complete all your missions before you will be admitted into the guild.
45200 := [Failure.] The Genoharadan are not easily fooled, <FirstName>. My agents reported Rulan fled from your battle. They tell me you didn't finish the job.
45201 := If you expect to join our guild, you will have to learn that we never leave a job unfinished. Go back to Kashyyyk. Find Rulan. Finish the job.
45202 := Until you do you will never be one of the Genoharadan. Now, is there some other business you wish to discuss?
45203 := I must congratulate you. Rulan was no easy target. I will admit that you are not the first to be sent after him, though you are the only one to succeed.
45204 := Here, take this Genoharadan visor. Many of our agents use them to increases their senses and improve their skills. It really is quite an extraordinary item.
45205 := With Rulan gone, you are another step closer to entering the guild. But until you have completed all the missions you will not be accepted into the Genoharadan.
45206 := Well done, <FullName>. And, as promised, here is your reward: a Genoharadan stealth unit. You'll find it is far superior to most.
45207 := Vorn's death brings you closer to completing your initiation into the Genoharadan, <FullName>. However, until you have completed all your missions you cannot be accepted into the guild.
45208 := Vorn, Rulan, Ithorak - that is all of them! You have done it, <FullName>. I hardly dreamed it was possible, yet now the task is done!
45209 := All the years of planning. Spying and digging to discover their true identities - it was all worth it! Now the Genoharadan are mine alone!
45210 := Poor, foolish <FullName>. You had no idea that the targets I sent you after were three of the Overseers of the Genoharadan, did you?
45211 := The Overseers have always acted in secret, their true identities hidden from the guild and even each other to prevent one person from seizing control of the entire guild.
45212 := But now they are dead, and I am the only Overseer left in the guild! All the agents of the Genoharadan are mine to command! And I couldn't have done it without your help, <FullName>!
45213 := I'm sorry, <FullName>. Even after all you have done for me I cannot let you join the Genoharadan now. You are far too dangerous: you know the true identity of the only surviving Overseer. 
45214 := I suppose I could try to have you eliminated, but I have seen your skill in dispatching the other Overseers. I think it would be in both our best interests if we were simply to part ways.
45215 := I'm afraid so. The other Overseers are dead, but there is still much work for me to do to cement my hold on the guild.
45216 := And as for you, <FullName>, I suspect your destiny lies elsewhere. You were never meant for the shadowy, secret world of the Genoharadan. You are bound to a much more public fate.
45217 := Goodbye, <FullName>. This is the last you will ever see of me or the Genoharadan, though if you watch carefully you may see evidence of our work throughout the galaxy.
45218 := *sigh* I was afraid it would come to this. Very well, we will finish this as these things always seem to end: in bloodshed. But the streets of Manaan are no place for this confrontation.
45219 := Meet me in the Dune Sea, <FullName>. There we will engage in a ritual battle according to the customs of my guild, just you and me.
45220 := Goodbye, <FullName>. I will wait for you in the Dune Sea. I don't need to remind you that you must come alone. If you do not, then you won't see me and you will never have your revenge.
45221 := Yes, <FullName>, the agents I sent to watch you have reported back to me concerning Lorgal's death. You should take pride in a job well done.
45222 := And, as promised, here is your reward for the task: a poisoned vibroblade forged exclusively for the use of those within our guild. It will serve you well, I am sure.
45223 := This assignment was only the beginning, <FullName>. A small test, which I am pleased to say you passed. But now a more difficult challenge awaits you.
45224 := There are three targets that the Genoharadan want you to remove. If you can eliminate all three, then you will gain full membership in our ancient guild.
45225 := The first is a Gammorean named Vorn Daasraad. The second is a shapeshifter called Rulan Prolik. The third is a Selkath known as Ithorak Guldar.
45226 := Just a warning, <FullName>. The assignments I have just given you are far more difficult than the simple bounties I gave you as your first test.
45227 := Complete all three missions and you will have proven yourself to be truly worthy of joining the Genoharadan.
45228 := As before, you will be well rewarded for each successful bounty. You can return to me after each mission to collect your reward.
45229 := Ithorak isn't violent like Rulan or Vorn, but in many ways he's far more dangerous. He's a con artist and blackmailer who's taken millions of credits from rich and powerful families.
45230 := He also deals in secrets and information, and these can be far more deadly than any blaster. But Ithorak is careful - we know he's somewhere here on Manaan, but we don't know where.
45231 := All we know is how to contact him. There's a Twi'lek named Vek at the Manaan swoop track. He can set up a meeting between you and Ithorak.
45232 := Ithorak poses as a merchant of rare antiquities. It's the perfect cover for his real work - it gives him access to rich and powerful families without drawing suspicion. 
45233 := You'll have to convince Vek that you represent a buyer interested in purchasing some rare art from Ithorak. Convince Vek, and he'll set up a meeting.
45234 := The meeting is your one chance to take Ithorak out, but be careful. He'll choose the time and place, and he's not going to leave himself vulnerable.
45235 := We don't know much about Rulan, except that he's some kind of shapeshifter. We don't even know if it's a natural ability or the result of some powerful alien technology.
45236 := But we suspect he's behind several prominent assassinations on the Outer Rim. The Genoharadan are worried he might decide to move his operations closer to the galactic core.
45237 := With his ability to assume virtually any form, he could wreak havoc in the Galactic Senate. We aren't about to let that happen.
45238 := Finding Rulan won't be easy, but we have reports he may be on Kashyyyk. He's probably honing his skills by hunting the dangerous creatures in the Shadowlands.
45239 := Vorn is a freelance bounty hunter. He's very, very good but he's a bit too sadistic for our tastes. He likes to sacrifice an efficient kill for the pleasure of watching his victim suffer.
45240 := The Genoharadan will tolerate a certain amount of competition, but Vorn has become too dangerous. You'd be surprised at how much political damage one rogue assassin can inflict.
45241 := Vorn was last seen on Tatooine. We suspect he's taking a break from hunting sentients by going after a Krayt dragon. We don't want him to leave the Dune Sea alive.
45242 := Just be careful when you face off against him. Vorn doesn't travel alone: he's always got his assault droid close at hand. The two of them make a formidable pair.
45243 := Is there anything else, <FullName>?
45244 := Yes, I have heard how the Sith razed the planet. Such radical overreactions are one reason the Genoharadan would prefer to see the Republic remain in power.
45245 := It is likely that Zuulan died in the attack, but we do not like to leave such things to chance. It will take some time before my agents can determine if Zuulan survived.
45246 := Since you did not kill Zuulan I cannot give you the bounty for this assignment. In any case, <FullName>, your role in Zuulan's fate is now over.
45247 := Do you have further business you wish to discuss at this time, or are we done here for now?
45248 := Are you threatening me? Here, where the Selkath authorities will arrest anyone who breaks the peace? Empty threats are the sign of a fool, <FullName>.
45249 := The Genoharadan have no wish to work with fools. I am disappointed in you, <FullName>, but you leave me with little choice.
45250 := I gave you an opportunity to join our guild, but through your actions you have shown yourself to be unfit. This is the last you will ever see of me or the Genoharadan, <FullName>. Goodbye.
45251 := [Failure.] Did you really think that Jedi mind trick could work on one of the Genoharadan? You are a fool, <FullName>!
45252 := [Failure] I'm disappointed in you, <FullName>. Did you really believe I would fall for such an obvious lie? Didn't you think I might have agents watching you to see how you performed?
45253 := I know you let Zuulan live, though the slaver's days are numbered. Even now one of our more reliable agents is hunting him down.
45254 := But I am willing to forget this incident, though you would do well to learn from it. There is a lesson for you here: the Genoharadan show no mercy.
45255 := Yes, <FullName>, I am aware of this. Our agents have been keeping a close eye on you, though I doubt you saw them. They were there when Zuulan met his untimely end.
45256 := And, as promised, here is your reward for the task: a blaster developed exclusively for the use of those within our guild. It will serve you well, I am sure.
45257 := Killing Calo Nord was an impressive display of your skills, but there is more to the Genoharadan than mere killing. To preserve the secrecy of our order our agents must be discrete.
45258 := You must be able to find and eliminate a target without drawing undo attention. You can never mention your assignments to others - not even your closest allies.
45259 := Also, you cannot ask people for information about your target. You must complete your mission using only the information I will provide. 
45260 := They wouldn't believe you. They might even think you are insane. Telling anyone about the Genoharadan would be pointless: we are very good at hiding any proof of our existence.
45261 := We will begin with something simple. Your first mission is to eliminate either of two targets: a Gran slaver named Zuulan Sentar or a Rodian anti-Republic terrorrist named Lorgal.
45262 := Lorgal is a radical who wants to destroy the Republic through terrorist acts. He is responsible for over two dozen bombings, leaving hundreds of civilians dead.
45263 := He was recently captured and is being held prisoner in the Republic base here on Manaan awaiting transport to Coruscant for trial - and a chance to publicly voice his radical beliefs.
45264 := We do not want to give him that chance. You must find a way to kill him before he leaves for Coruscant, but you must be subtle. It must look like an accident or an unexplainable death.
45265 := The Republic would be glad to get rid of Lorgal, so they won't investigate his death closely. As long as he isn't struck down by a weapon in his cell, the Genoharadan will be satisfied.
45266 := Zuulan was a common inter-galactic slaver who tried to kidnap the daughter of a Coruscant Senator. He failed and the girl was recovered, but Zuulan himself escaped.
45267 := He will probably try another similar kidnapping soon. If he succeeds, he might ransom his victim in exchange for dangerous political secrets that could threaten the Republic itself.
45268 := The Genoharadan want to eliminate him before this happens. Our latest information places Zuulan on Dantooine - he often sells illicit goods to the wealthy settlers of that world.
45269 := His land speeder was spotted near one of the settler's estates on Dantooine. Zuulan rarely strays far from his speeder in case he needs to make a quick escape. You should look for him there.
45270 := Remember - tell no one about this. If there are others with you when you confront Zuulan or Lorgal, make it seem as if you are acting on behalf of the Republic, not the Genoharadan.
45271 := That is all for now. Return to me when either Lorgal or Zuulan is dead and I will reward you. If you wish to complete both missions, feel free. You will be suitably rewarded for each.
45272 := Remember - tell no one about this. If there are others with you when you confront Lorgal, make it seem as if you are acting on behalf of the Republic, not the Genoharadan.
45273 := That is all for now. Return to me when Lorgal is dead and you will be suitably rewarded.
45274 := Your first mission is a simple one: eliminate a Rodian anti-Republic terrorist named Lorgal.
45275 := Greetings once again, <FullName>. Or should I say "Revan"?
45276 := Yes, it is probably a good idea to hide your true identity. We Genoharadan are masters of gathering information, but few others know the truth about you. There is power in secrets.
45277 := Don't be naive. I am of the Genoharadan. We are bounty hunters, assassins and spies. We have agents with the Republic, we have agents with the Sith.
45278 := Did you really think we wouldn't know about your little encounter on the Leviathan? Although I will admit, we were as surprised as you... the Jedi did a remarkable job of faking your death.
45279 := I will admit, my first impulse on hearing this news was to disappear. The Genoharadan don't often become directly associated with such prominent figures as a former Dark Lord of the Sith.
45280 := But then I began to realize the potential advantages of the situation. Assuming you complete the tasks required for your initiation into our guild, you could be very valuable to us.
45281 := So for now, little has changed. I will keep your secret, just as you have kept ours. I am curious to see how events will play out between you and your old apprentice.
45282 := If the situation becomes dangerous, we Genoharadan can simply disappear as we have often done in the past. But for now, we will continue your initiation into the guild.
45283 := A human? There are Selkath everywhere, but you choose to speak with me. Am I so different? Do you think I have answers that others do not?
45284 := And so you leave, perhaps to return. Perhaps not. Yet I will remain here, for my work is not done.
45285 := These are strange times. The Sith and the Republic battle to control the galaxy, but their war destroys what they both seek to possess.
45286 := The war sows fear and confusion, people are lost. They want guidance, direction. They have questions, and they want answers. That is why I am here... I too seek answers.
45287 := A name? There is power in names, yet in the end a name alone means less than nothing. I am Hulas, a traveler from the world of Duro. And what is your name, human?
45288 := You presume to know my business, human. Yet if your name becomes important to me I only have to check with the Selkath registry to know it.
45289 := But for now, keep your secret well hidden if you wish. What is it you want with me, human?
45290 := <FullName>. Now we know something about each other... but really, we still know nothing. What do you want with me, human?
45291 := I will do my best to answer them, though I am only recently arrived to this world. Many of your questions would be better answered by others, I'm sure.
45292 := The Selkath are a species of secrets. They invite both the Sith and the Republic to their world, but welcome neither. They keep their true allegiance close to the vest.
45293 := They hide their true numbers in great cities beneath the ocean that no off-worlder will ever see. They guard the secret of Kolto - where it is made, how it is made.
45294 := The Selkath are a great mystery. To the Sith, to the Republic, to me... their secrets are what makes them strong. I would tell you more if I knew, but I do not.
45295 := War is the tool of empire building. The Sith conquer world after world, taking resources as they want. They came to Manaan to plunder the most valuable resource of all - Kolto.
45296 := But Manaan is different, it is difficult to conquer. If the Sith attack the Selkath can slip away to safety far below the oceans. They can hoard their Kolto - or give it to the Republic.
45297 := So Manaan gives us a glimpse of how the Sith will react should they win this war. Here the Sith must use diplomacy and negotiation: tools they will need to maintain their empire.
45298 := They might try, but an army can only build an empire, not sustain it. Rebellions, insurrections - in time the weight of the Sith's own policies would bring them down.
45299 := It may take a century, or two, or even three. But eventually the Sith will learn diplomacy or their Empire will fall.
45300 := The Republic comes to Manaan with offers of alliance, but the Selkath are wary. They have no wish to join the Republic, given recent history.
45301 := The Republic say they protect the galaxy, but they have seen much war: Exar Kun, the Mandalorians, the Sith. Why does the Republic breed so many enemies?
45302 := Until they know the answer, the Selkath will not join. They have no wish to make the Republic's many enemies their own. More than this I cannot say.
45303 := I am an observer, a seeker of answers. The Sith and Republic vie for control of the galaxy, and I am anxious to know as much as I can about the eventual victor.
45304 := On Manaan, I can observe both parties in relative safety. The Sith and the Republic co-exist here, unlike anywhere else in the galaxy. Here I watch, and study, and learn.
45305 := No, a spy is a stealer of hidden secrets. A spy slinks in the shadows and gains entrance to forbidden rooms. I am only a simple observer.
45306 := I watch the Sith on this world. I watch the Republic. I watch the Selkath. I see how they act and react and I can draw conclusions about their true natures. I see what drives them.
45307 := And when an ultimate victor emerges from this war, I will know them better than they know themselves. This will give me power: the power to survive and thrive no matter what events may come.
45308 := Sit. Watch. Study. Learn. Wait. For now, that is all. I gather knowledge and I wait for a day when this knowledge will serve me well.
45309 := The Republic. The Sith. The war. Everything. Nothing. Answers are always hardest to find when the questions are unclear. Yet that does not stop us from searching.
45310 := I want to ask you about the Genoharadan.
45311 := Who are you again?
45312 := Senni Vek gave me a message to see you.
45313 := Never mind. I want to ask you some other questions.
45314 := He gave me this datapad. It mentions the Genoharadan.
45315 := I've never heard of you.
45316 := You can't impose your rules on me!
45317 := Forget it.
45318 := Very well, I'll keep your secret.
45319 := How does anybody hire you if nobody knows you exist?
45320 := What does this have to do with me?
45321 := Are you saying you serve the Republic?
45322 := What's in this for me?
45323 := Why would I want to join you?
45324 := Okay, what do I have to do to join?
45325 := This is a little hard to believe.
45326 := Why would the Genoharadan protect the Republic?
45327 := How will killing innocent people help the Republic?
45328 := You're nothing but common assassins!
45329 := I understand.
45330 := I've changed my mind. I don't want to be a part of this.
45331 := I will preserve the secrecy of your order.
45332 := I'll be back later.
45333 := I have some questions about the Genoharadan.
45334 := I don't have any other questions.
45335 := Do the Jedi Order know about your guild?
45336 := Why haven't the Genoharadan assassinated Malak?
45337 := Who formed this guild? Where did it begin?
45338 := Tell me more about the Genoharadan.
45339 := Tell me about the Overseers.
45340 := How are the Overseers selected?
45341 := What happens if an Overseer is killed?
45342 := What else can you tell me about the Genoharadan?
45343 := Ithorak Guldar is dead.
45344 := Rulan Prolik got away. I can't find him.
45345 := [Persuade/Lie] Rulan Prolik is dead.
45346 := Rulan Prolik is dead.
45347 := Vorn Daasraad is dead.
45348 := You tricked me!
45349 := What are you talking about?
45350 := You used me!
45351 := Glad I could help you out. What happens now?
45352 := So when do I get to join the guild?
45353 := So that's it? We just part ways?
45354 := This isn't over, Hulas! Nobody plays me for a fool!
45355 := Goodbye, Hulas.
45356 := Nobody plays me for a fool! You'll pay for this, Hulas!
45357 := Lorgal is dead.
45358 := Is there anything else?
45359 := Tell me about Ithorak Guldar.
45360 := Why would Vek set up a meeting between us?
45361 := Sure. I'll just tell him I want to kill his boss and book an appointment.
45362 := Tell me about Rulan Prolik.
45363 := Any tips for this mission?
45364 := So how do I find someone who could look like anyone?
45365 := Tell me about Vorn Daasraad.
45366 := Any tips for this mission?
45367 := I'll find Vorn and bring him down!
45368 := I can't complete the Zuulan Sentar mission. Dantooine is destroyed.
45369 := You better give me Zuulan's bounty anyway, before someone gets hurt.
45370 := [Force Persuade] You should give me Zuulan's bounty anyway.
45371 := [Persuade/Lie] Zuulan Sentar is dead.
45372 := Zuulan Sentar is dead.
45373 := I'm ready to prove myself worthy of the Genoharadan.
45374 := What happens if I tell someone about this?
45375 := I understand. Who is my target?
45376 := Tell me about Lorgal.
45377 := Tell me about Zuulan Sentar.
45378 := Is there anything else?
45379 := I'm not Revan anymore. Don't call me that.
45380 := Revan? I have no idea what you're talking about?
45381 := How did you know that?
45382 := I guess this changes things.
45383 := So what happens now?
45384 := I'll be going now.
45385 := Answers? What are you talking about?
45386 := That's a rather strange greeting.
45387 := Who are you?
45388 := My name is none of your business.
45389 := My name is <FullName>.
45390 := Nothing. I'll be going now.
45391 := I want to ask you some questions.
45392 := What do you know about the Selkath?
45393 := Do you know anything about the Sith here on Manaan?
45394 := I want to ask you some more questions.
45395 := The Sith don't negotiate. They'll use brute force to maintain control.
45396 := What can you tell me about the Republic here on Manaan?
45397 := What are you doing here on Manaan?
45398 := You're a spy!
45399 := So that's all you do? Sit and watch?
45400 := Answers? Answers to what?
45401 := It is most distressing that the Sith Embassy should have been invaded as it has. It makes us Selkath seem like we are failing in our duties...
45402 := The Republic has been acting against our will I fear. While we do not hold it against you personally, we must revise our opinions of your government.
45403 := Stop, human!
45404 := The flow of kolto to the surface has been virtually cut off, with what does arrive corrupted.
45405 := We have detected a number of underwater detonations coming from the vicinity of the Hrakert Rift.
45406 := You have been known to have asked questions about this, and our spy monitors in the Republic Embassy recorded you leaving in a submersible that descended to the Hrakert Rift.
45407 := You will come with us immediately to answer for your actions, or we will be forced to take you by force!
45408 := That will be for us to decide, human!
45409 := Do not be foolish, little human! We have the entire armed forces of Manaan at our disposal. Should you attempt to resist, you would be overwhelmed before you ever reached your ship!
45410 := Now come with us!
45411 := I haven't done anything!
45412 := Very well. I will come peacefully.
45413 := You'll never take me alive!
45414 := Why do you bother me, human? I do not wish to speak to you.
45415 := Leave, human.
45416 := I am here for my own reasons. Those who know of me and wish to do business, know I can be found here.
45417 := You will either do business with me or leave.
45418 := I am not here to give you knowledge. Do business with me or leave.
45419 := Good.
45420 := I trade and sell Pazaak Cards for those that have interest. If you have interest, then we can do business. Otherwise leave.
45421 := Very well.
45422 := Never mind.
45423 := Why are you just standing here in a corner?
45424 := I just wanted to ask you a few questions.
45425 := Fine, I'll leave.
45426 := Business?
45427 := Let's see what you've got.
45428 := It is a most terrible day when such violence happens in a peaceful city such as this. The Sith Embassy... attacked... Terrible!
45429 := I only hope that this is not the worst to befall them...
45430 := The Selkath now seem more distant than before... They treat members of the Republic at arms length only... I hope this does not negatively impact our trade.
45431 := If they give too much deference to the Sith, then the monsters will simply come in and take over!
45432 := You cannot touch me in here, human. No conventional weapon can penetrate this cage. Nothing can stop me from spreading my manifesto during my trial!
45433 := Yes, human? Have you come to sneer and jeer like the others? Come to see Lorgal the Great Liberator caged like an animal?
45434 := Yes, leave me. You are a tool of the Republic, a slave who cannot even see your own chains. But do not fear: someday I - or someone like me - will destroy the Republic and free you all.
45435 := There are many who want me dead, including the guards in this room. But the Republic doesn't kill prisoners without a trial. That is why I am protected.
45436 := This energy cage keeps me safe from blaster and blade. The Republic will keep me alive for transfer to Coruscant, and then all the galaxy will witness my trial!
45437 := Kill a million people with a mighty star cruiser and you are a war hero. Kill a hundred with a thermal detonator and you are a terrorist.
45438 := You are obviously blind to the Republic chains shackled around your neck. You cannot see me for the hero I am; you think I am nothing but a criminal who deserves death.
45439 := [Use Force Kill to kill Lorgal.]
45440 := [Use Force Choke to kill Lorgal.]
45441 := I've got better things to do than argue with prisoners.
45442 := I'm here to kill you, Lorgal. And I think I'll enjoy it.
45443 := Liberator? You're nothing but a murderer!
45444 := You deserve to die for your crimes, Lorgal.
45445 := It's not the same! You kill civilians and children!

46137 := This datapad contains a record of Calo Nord's trophy kills... sentient and otherwise.

The last entry is an account of a recent Rancor hunt.

"What the Rancor lacked in intelligence it made up for in size, strength and ferocity. Conventional blasters were all but useless against its impenetrable hide, and I was forced to resort to more unorthodox methods to bring the beast down.

Some well placed mines near a watering hole were the first step, their explosions herding the creature into a dead-end canyone where I lay in wait, perched among the rocks.

As soon as the Rancor was below me, I dropped down onto its massive neck. It reared back, bucking and clawing in an effort to dislodge me, but I had the perfect position. 

Unable to shake me, the monster opened its mouth in an outraged howl, and I was able to flip several frag grenades down its gaping maw.

The explosion blew me clear of the shredded corpse, but luckily the head was still intact. If I take it to Taris, I'm sure Davik will mount it in his trophy room along with the other heads I have collected for him.

Davik's also expressed interest in hiring me. I may take him up on his offer, even though I still have yet to claim the greatest hunting trophy of all: a pearl from one of the Krayt Dragons of Tatooine."

46604 := I had hoped you would be gullible enough to show up alone, but obviously I underestimated you... although I see from their expressions that your friends have no clue what is going on here.
46605 := Not that it matters. If I win here, what you know of the Genoharadan will die here with you. If you win, the guild will vanish until they select new Overseers... if they even survive.
46606 := I am not surprised to see you here, <FullName>. I am surprised you came alone, however. I thought you would know by now how dangerous we Genoharadan are.
46607 := The other Overseers were alone and unprepared. I am ready for you - and I have friends. Goodbye, <FullName>. Our time together was... interesting.
46608 := Brothers of the Genoharadan: attack!
46609 := You have seen me betray the other Overseers, yet you still believe a Genoharadan cares anything about honor? That is a foolish mistake, <FullName>. One you won't live to regret.
46610 := You have great potential, <FullName>. Even the Genoharadan's best agents would not likely have been able to eliminate the other three Overseers.
46611 := You even have the potential to become an Overseer yourself, one day. That's why I have to kill you here: eliminating the competition is the key to maintaining my power.
46612 := My thoughts exactly.
46613 := Really? If you knew this, you should have been smart enough to bring your friends with you. You helped me betray the other Overseers: you should know I don't play fair.
46614 := Three Genoharadan Overseers out of four are dead, Hulas. Time to finish the job!
46615 := I knew you were too much of a coward to come alone.
46616 := I see you've brought some friends as well, Hulas.
46617 := I killed the other Overseers. I can kill you too, Hulas.

46649 := You don't know who you deal with, do you? I take time to explain it to you, but it hot out here so I just kill you instead.
46650 := So, you decide to show your face. I don't know who you are or who sent you to kill me, but you should have stayed hiding!
46651 := You don't know who you deal with, do you? I take time to explain it to you, but it hot out here so I just kill you instead.
46652 := I got bad news for person who rig this mine on swoop bike and tried to reprogram droid against me: it didn't work!

46743 := We have seen you, Interloper! You are a servant of the Elders. By order of the One you must die!
46744 := You have defeated the murderous animals! We thank you, human, for saving us!
46745 := If you had... had waited for a better opportunity, yes! But then we would have been in danger... but I can see your point!
46746 := You are smart as well as valorous. We thank you again for saving us.
46747 := If your arrival had not been so fortuitously timed, we would have been in great danger. We thank you again for saving us.
46748 := You... you are not? Then what are you here for?
46749 := None of us are here by choice... and all seek a way to escape.
46750 := As do we all.
46751 := We have seen little in the short time we have been on this world that would indicate a way off... except...
46752 := The Sith... we have seen Sith interceptors in the sky once or twice... They appear to be able to fly unimpeded through the field which forced us to crash. If we could somehow find a ship of theirs...
46753 := But it is too much to hope for. The Sith would surely kill us on sight if we were found. Much better to hide and hope the Republic finds us here eventually.
46754 := We believe they may have something to do with the large temple structure to the north of here. We have been suspicious of that structure since we landed, but we cannot approach it... the Mandalorians hunt in that area.
46755 := Why... why would you not be? All we survivors on this strange world must band together, else the marauding inhabitants would slaughter us all!
46756 := They attack any they come across. They are barbaric savages who feast upon the bodies of the dead!
46757 := The only beings who crash here that can hold them off are the Mandalorians, and we dare not go near them... we know of their depredations too well.
46758 := We know little beyond what we have told you already... savages who eat the dead and attack anyone on sight. If it were not for them, this world might almost be habitable...
46759 := Yes, there are. More than you might think, although that may just be because they aren't killed as easily as we are.
46760 := With their weapons they raid and kill other survivors, and can fight off the natives as well. They seem to have some sort of invisibility or light cloaking shield that hides them until they strike.
46761 := They are north of here by a large temple structure. We dare not approach it, for they would surely kill us.
46762 := But we cannot delay here much longer... The longer we stay, the more likely either the Mandalorians or the natives will find us and kill us.
46763 := No, we dare not. If we remain here, it will only be a matter of time before the natives or the Mandalorians find us and kill us.
46764 := We had crashed here when our mining survey vessel encountered some strange sort of energy field. It disrupted our engine and power system and forced us to make a crash landing on this world.
46765 := Our ship sank far out to sea, but a handful of us were able to make it to this island... more than you see here, though.
46766 := What?! You... No!
46767 := Many have been killed at the hands of the locals. A few tried to swim to one of the closer islands, but we have not heard from them in many days.
46768 := Of the 10 of us who remained here, we two are the only remaining survivors...
46769 := No, we dare not. If we remain here, it will only be a matter of time before the natives or the Mandalorians find us and kill us.
46770 := I believe that would be the best choice... The others have not returned, but it may be because they could find no way to.
46771 := It would be worth the risk, rather than stay here and face certain death...
46772 := I thank you one last time, human, for saving us. We shall remember you, and hope that, should you escape, you will tell the Republic of those of us stranded here.
46773 := If I had known you were there, I would have waited a couple minutes...
46774 := Well, they attacked me first...
46775 := Er... No problem!
46776 := Actually, I'm not here to save you.
46777 := I'm here to finish the job they started!
46778 := It's not like I had a choice...
46779 := I have to find a way off this world.
46780 := Spill it!
46781 := Except?
46782 := How do you know I'm friendly to you?
46783 := Why would they have attacked you?
46784 := Has anyone found a way off this world?

46786 := There are Mandalorians here??
46787 := Where are they?

46791 := What happened?
46792 := Where are the rest of your companions?
46793 := You could stay in our ship if you want.

46878 := I will only show you where it is once you've brought me the head of their leader!
46879 := Threaten me all you want, but until then, I will show you nothing! The souls of my warriors rest uneasy knowing they still live...
46880 := They appear from the shadows, seeming to blend in and out of thin air. They gather near the obelisk at the far side of the field, attacking any who approach.
46881 := Perhaps they worship it, and kill us as sacrifices... but they haven't eaten any of the bodies... They hold us in contempt!
46882 := My blood burns at their insult! The souls of the dead howl in anger!
46883 := You must go there and kill them so that my warriors will be avenged... Only then will I give you the reward I have promised you.
46884 := If you do not slay them, then you will never gain entrance to the Temple anyway. They make their camp there, and you think they will let you pass?
46885 := When you do get the head of their leader, I will be waiting here.
46886 := Th... thank you for what you have done! The souls of my warriors can rest at peace now.
46887 := And with his head, I can gain his strength so that we may overcome his people in the future.
46888 := And now, for the reward I promised...
46889 := I found these while searching among the wreckage. I don't know what they do, but I hid them here quite some time ago. They are yours now.
46890 := You have earned the gratitude of our people for eliminating the killers who lurked by the Temple of the Ancients.
46891 := Now the souls of my warriors can rest in peace. Thank you, Revan.
46892 := You are the great warrior now, it seems. You came before and defeated us, and now do so again.
46893 := If you are as great as you appear to be, then perhaps you can help us as well.
46894 := There have been many attacks on the island recently by blue- and red-armored warriors against our scouts.
46895 := If that is your name for them, then yes.
46896 := I was given the task of rooting out their forces, but as you can see, I have failed... Failed both the One, who gave me the command, and the dozen warriors who accompanied me... and did not return.
46897 := If you are a great warrior, then you may yet be able to destroy them where I have failed. Surely you have powers beyond my ken, and those would undoubtedly prove critical.
46898 := I assure you, I can give a reward, I... You... you what?
46899 := You came to the One seeking entrance to the Temple of the Ancients, did you not?
46900 := These killers have made their base of sorts near the entrance to the Temple itself. Our scouts can no longer travel safely in that area, and any passage by you towards the Elders' compound would be in danger as well.
46901 := Your own best interests lie in their deaths... and...
46902 := There have been many wrecks that have crashed onto this world... Many of the items from these vessels may be of some use to you. If you bring me back the head of their leader, I could show you one of the better caches...
46903 := Good. I can see that you are a true friend to our people.
46904 := I will be waiting here for you when you return.
46905 := Why, to gain his strength and knowledge, of course! So will you do this thing? For both of us?
46906 := Whether you believe you do or not, there is no way into the Temple without our assistance. Bring his head to me, and both our causes will be helped.
46907 := I am an old and bitter warrior. My injuries are many and I have just come back from a fearsome battle... a slaughter. Even a light hit could kill me, so don't threaten me with violence!
46908 := I have to go now.
46909 := You mentioned something about salvage?
46910 := What can you tell me about the Mandalorians?
46911 := I don't have to do your dirty work!
46912 := No, I have not.
46913 := They are dead. Here is their leader's head.
46914 := Yeah, I kicked your backsides pretty good.
46915 := What do you want?
46916 := What of it?
46917 := ... And? So?
46918 := I know the beings you are talking about.
46919 := Mandalorians!
46920 := I've already killed the Mandalorians.
46921 := OK, I'll find those Mandalorians.
46922 := I don't really feel like.
46923 := Why should I help you?
46924 := I still see no reason to help you.
46925 := And?
46926 := Very well, I'll do it.
46927 := Why do you need his head?
46928 := I don't need anything from you!
46929 := Why don't I just take that information?

46992 := The wrath of the Rakata will consume you all!
46993 := Please, off-worlder! Release us!
46994 := When we return to our village, the One will reward you greatly.
46995 := If we survive, you will all know the wrath of the Rakata!
46996 := Release us from these cages and we can escape!
46997 := Thank you for saving me. I shall try to return to our camp.
46998 := The One will not let the Elders live!
46999 := Get us out of here and you shall have the gratitude of the Rakata!
47000 := You have my thanks. I shall try to return to the One and tell him what has happened.
47001 := Thank you for freeing us! You will eternally have the gratitude of the Rakata!
47002 := But... I can't help but wonder, off-worlder... Why have you freed us?
47003 := What?? You shall never kill me!
47004 := Er... yes... yes! Thank you!
47005 := We shall return to the One and tell of what you have done.
47006 := And neither do we. We thank you for what you have done for us.
47007 := The One! He sent someone back for us as I knew he would!
47008 := Actually I just wanted a moving target.
47009 := Shut up and accept it!
47010 := I have no love for the Elders.
47011 := I work for the One.
47012 := Yes, Revan? Is there anything I can help you with?
47013 := You... you have! Thank you! Thank you, Revan!
47014 := This data will aid us greatly in our research.
47015 := It is ancient, that we know. And it is guarded by advanced technology that only Force sensitive races can penetrate.
47016 := Recently we have seen ships coming and going from it, similar in design to ones that came at about the same time you did many years ago.
47017 := Other than that, we do not know... although we would dearly like to find out.
47018 := You have done our people a great service here, Revan, but your destiny lies elsewhere. May the blessings of the Elders go with you.
47019 := You have returned at last, Revan. I was beginning to wonder what had happened to you in the Temple.
47020 := Very well then. Come and go as you please.
47021 := What am I doing? You mean, the purpose of my research here?
47022 := Yes, yes, my research.
47023 := As you may have heard from our historians, in our distant past we melded technology and the Force to create truly wondrous effects.
47024 := We guided ships across the galaxy using our power, and incorporated its use into all aspects of our society.
47025 := But... something happened somewhere.
47026 := Yes, likely you have.
47027 := Perhaps not, but it is critical to my explanation of my work.
47028 := When my species began to lose control over the Force, the power we had held over the subject races began to decay, along with our empire. The races we subjugated rose up, plagues swept our worlds... we could do nothing against all these calamities.
47029 := There are a variety of theories on what happened. Perhaps we became immune to the effects of the Force from overuse. Perhaps our breeding habits rendered our species insensitive to it over time. None truly know.
47030 := The only discernable result was that we could no longer command the Force as we had. Its power had escaped us.
47031 := With its loss, our technologies could no longer hold us as far above the subjugated races we ruled, and our empire began to crumble. The races we subjugated rose up, plagues swept our worlds... we could do nothing against all these calamities.
47032 := In the end, only the members of our race left here, on our homeworld, survived.
47033 := Every once in a while, there is an individual born who has an affinity for the Force. Maybe not the ability to use it directly, but at least the ability to remain open to it.
47034 := I believe this is a sign that whatever genes our species had that gave us the ability to use the Force are not completely gone. Perhaps when the ancestors of the current tribes fled beneath the surface, some retained this trait.
47035 := We have been working for years to isolate this gene in an attempt to resurrect it in our species as well.
47036 := We of the Elders do not have Force sensitivity ourselves, but by harnessing the genetic structure of other tribes, we hope to be able to breed the gene back into our species.
47037 := You make us seem like monsters... Truly we are not.
47038 := We capture them, yes, but only because the tribes have become extremely xenophobic in their millenia trapped on this world. They would not aid us willingly, and killed our messengers when we asked.
47039 := We believe that if we get a large enough genetic sample, we can reintroduce the recessive Force sensitive genes back into our people, allowing us to once again access the heritage of our past.
47040 := Yes, the Temple. It can only be entered by those sensitive to the Force, so it has been barred to us for ages.
47041 := What we may find inside will allow us to lift the other tribes out of the barbarism into which they have fallen and restore us as a productive force in the galaxy.
47042 := That is a worry, but we hope that our good intentions will let them accept us...
47043 := Unite the tribes and take our place in the galaxy at large.
47044 := No! We do not want to fall down the path that so twisted our people before.
47045 := This time, perhaps we can redeem ourselves in the eyes of the galaxy, and become a force of good.
47046 := We are quite far along, having had centuries to work already, but with the arrival of another tribe on our island, we have been restricted in our movements to just our enclave.
47047 := We have captured a few of their warriors, but the one that really interests us is their leader... the One.
47048 := Those with the genes we seek seem to be marked... Marked with a destiny that causes them to rise above others as we did as a species early on.
47049 := In hearing the stories his warriors tell of the One, we believe that he may hold some of the genes we seek. He may be nearing Force sensitivity.
47050 := Unfortunately, he and his people are much too aggressive and violent for us to ever get close enough to study him. His corpse would not do either, as only a living, working body is of use to us.
47051 := Maybe in time, though, the differences between our peoples will lessen enough that we may study one another and gain the information we need.
47052 := We would not revert to our old ways, rest assured, Revan. We merely seek data on genetic drifts and changes in the millenia of our imprisonment here.
47053 := Genetic data on drifts and changes over the many millenia we have been here. Specific data on exceptional individuals.
47054 := If only we had access to the knowledge of our ancestors... They must have known much, much more than us. They had a much greater population sample to work with.
47055 := I believe that in the Temple there may be the information we seek. Perhaps in old archives or scrolls... maybe even in an ancient computer if any is still functioning.
47056 := This information would help us greatly in our work, and we would be very grateful to you for it.
47057 := Is there anything else I can help you with?
47058 := Indeed... Nothing much happened for many years it seems.
47059 := You came here and gained access to the Temple, and were never heard from again. Some thought you might have betrayed us to the others, but they were never able to penetrate our defenses.
47060 := But if you will help us now, then the time taken is nothing. Is there anything else you require?
47061 := We had met previously when last you entered our enclave, many years ago. You inquired as to my research then as well.
47062 := I have to go now.
47063 := I have found data on the genetic structure of your species.
47064 := What do you know about the Temple?
47065 := Tell me about your research again.
47066 := I don't have time to talk.
47067 := What are you doing?
47068 := You know damn well what I'm asking!
47069 := Why do you have these prisoners?
47070 := What is your research?
47071 := I've heard this before.
47072 := I don't need to hear this.
47073 := What happened?
47074 := No Rakata can use the Force?
47075 := So what is your research then?
47076 := Why don't you just ask them for help?
47077 := You're trying to rebuild your genetic structure?
47078 := You're capturing prisoners... for their genes?
47079 := Heritage... You mean the Temple?
47080 := I don't know how the Republic and the Sith would see you...
47081 := You want to reunite the tribes?
47082 := You're trying to restore your empire, aren't you!
47083 := How close are you to finishing your research?
47084 := Do any of these warriors have what you're looking for?
47085 := How can you find these genes?
47086 := The One? What's special about him?
47087 := I don't know if your eugenics program is a good thing...
47088 := How could I help with your research?
47089 := What kind of information do you need?
47090 := Nothing much happened...
47091 := You know me?
47092 := Only through our experiments and analysis can our people hope to regain our past.
47093 := With the new information we can gain from the Temple, we will be able to complete our experiments!
47094 := Our work is the most important one undertaken by our people. The future of our tribe rests with us.
47095 := When this new data we gain is assimilated, we shall gain unprecedented advances!
47096 := There is only one way to gain access to the Temple from the outside. The shields are designed to lower in response to a ritualistic chant detailed in the ancient text held by the Keeper of History.
47097 := Hurry, Revan. The Star Forge must be destroyed, Malak must be stopped. You cannot afford to waste time here with us.
47098 := Hurry, Revan. The Star Forge must be destroyed.
47099 := You are back, Revan. When you refused to enter the Temple alone we feared you had betrayed us again. We did not expect you to return.
47100 := Did you find what you were looking for inside the Temple? Did you discover the secrets to destroy the Star Forge?
47101 := Then we wish you luck, Revan. For far too long we have kept ourselves hidden away on this lonely world, hoping to keep the Star Forge from unleashing its evil upon the rest of the galaxy.
47102 := Perhaps... perhaps once the Star Forge is destroyed it will be time for us to leave this world, to rejoin the galaxy we have isolated ourselves from for so long.
47103 := You are right, of course. This is not something to be rushed into; not while the Star Forge still exists.
47104 := You must go now, Revan. The Star Forge feeds the power of your old apprentice. If you do not stop him soon he will become too powerful for even you to stop.
47105 := You... you mean you have betrayed us, again? For a thousand generations we have guarded the secrets within the Temple: we cannot allow you to unleash them on the galaxy! 
47106 := Guards, destroy Revan! Do not let the traitor escape!
47107 := Revan, you are back. Our scout has told us of how you rescued him. His injuries are severe, but we believe he will survive. We are grateful for what you have done.
47108 := Risking your own life to save our scout seems to prove that you have changed significantly since the last time you were here, Revan. But you have deceived us before.
47109 := Yes, Revan. Is there something you need?
47110 := You might find these things in the camp of the One, back towards the beach where you first landed. But if you go there, the Rakata will surely attack you.
47111 := It would be much safer to try and salvage the parts you need from any of the wrecks scattered across the island.
47112 := You should speak to Osraa, the Keeper of History. He is located near the great computer on the far side of our enclave. But I will do my best to answer your questions.
47113 := The Star Forge is a blight upon our world, an orbiting symbol of the failures and horrors of our past. We have long searched for a way to destroy it, and now you finally have given us that chance.
47114 := If you wish to know more about this you should speak to Osraa, the Keeper of History.
47115 := We ourselves can no longer enter the Temple, Revan. We do not have the power of the Force. But you can enter, with our help.
47116 := We have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.
47117 := We tried to negotiate with them. We went emissaries under a flag or truce when the One first arrived on this island. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.
47118 := The One is mad with power. We choose not to fight him, so our only course of action is to stay here in isolation where we are safe; just as we have done for the past 20,000 years.
47119 := When the One first arrived on this island, we sent emissaries under a flag of truce to try and negotiate with his tribe. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.
47120 := We do have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.
47121 := The time has come for you to atone for your past crimes, Revan. But the task ahead will be difficult. Those you call dark Jedi - followers of your old apprentice - now dwell within the Temple.
47122 := The last time you and Malak entered the Temple you must have found the controls to raise and lower the shields. Those inside can lower the barrier to allow other Force users to enter and exit the Temple. 
47123 := But they will not be able to prevent us from using the ritual to gain you access. Once inside, however, we can do nothing to help you.
47124 := You must prove to us that you are not the same as you once were, Revan. You must prove that you have changed.
47125 := Recently several of our scouts were captured by the One. Most of them were brutally slaughtered, but we have information that one of the scouts is still alive.
47126 := They will use unimaginable tortures to force the scout to reveal everything he knows about our tribe. And once the One is done with him, the scout will be executed like the others.
47127 := You must prove you have truly changed by risking your own life to save another. Rescue our scout from the clutches of the One, and we will consider helping you.
47128 := If you do not help us, Revan, then we will not help you enter the Temple. You will be trapped on this world forever.
47129 := We would prefer if you could find some way to save the prisoner without bloodshed, but we don't believe that will be possible. The One does not like to negotiate.
47130 := Risking your life to save the prisoner would show us that you are sincere about making amends for the past.
47131 := The prisoner is being held in the chamber of the One himself. Return to us once he is free. Until then you have free run of our enclave.
47132 := Revan, you have rescued a member of our tribe from the One at great personal risk to yourself. We believe this action shows you have truly changed since your last visit here.
47133 := The Council has decided we will trust you once more. For many generations we have sought a way to enter the Temple and discover the means to destroy the Star Forge.
47134 := But only those who can command the Force - those like you - can enter the Temple of the Ancients. We no longer have that power. That was why we helped you the last time you were here.
47135 := But you cannot enter the Temple without our help, Revan. Only the ancient rituals of our people can lower the shield for you to enter. You need us as much as we need you, Revan.
47136 := You can try to enter the Temple without our help, but you will fail. When you are ready to see reason, return to us and we can begin the ritual.
47137 := [Success] Yes, your actions seem to show you to be an ally of our cause. But how can we be certain the rescue was not just an attempt to win our trust so you can exploit us?
47138 := That cannot happen. The knowledge of the Ancients was that of extinction. If we allow such technology to be unleashed again, it is inevitable that the Rakata will be utterly destroyed.
47139 := That is why the secrets of our ancestors have been locked away in the Temple. We would give our lives to see that they do not fall into the hands of the One, or any like him.
47140 := You should know this from the last time you were here, Revan. We explained all this to you then.
47141 := Why do you serve the One, Revan? What lies has he told you to bind you to his will?
47142 := The One does not know how to lower the shields around the Temple! Only we Elders have that knowledge - as you should well know from your last visit, Revan!
47143 := We of the Elder Council did not expect to see you again, Revan. We thought you had betrayed us. Why have you returned to our village after all this time?
47144 := Your words are confusing. We recognize you: you are the one called Revan. You are the one who came here before - you and Malak, the one who served you.
47145 := You promised to help us. In exchange for our aid you swore to destroy the ancient evils of our Rakata ancestors! Are you saying this means nothing to you now?
47146 := Hmmm... we do sense something different about you. Something that has changed. You are not the same as you were before. Perhaps your memory has been lost.
47147 := Yet the power you wield - what you call the Force - is within you still. You can still help us, Revan... if we dare to trust you again.
47148 := [Success] If what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Ask what you will, Revan, and we will try to help you understand.
47149 := If what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Ask what you will, Revan, and we will try to help you understand.
47150 := You arrived with Malak - your servant - three of your galactic standard years ago. We saw your ship plummet to the earth, a victim of the disruptor field that guards this planet.
47151 := You and Malak both survived the crash, though you were stranded here on our world. And in your search for a way off this planet, you discovered our enclave - just as you did this time.
47152 := You used the Force to draw the Rakata language from our minds, even as you planted Basic into our skulls so we could help you in your quest to escape this world.
47153 := We helped you enter the Temple of the Ancients. You and Malak both. And you now, after all this time, you have returned - with your mind wiped clean. Is there anything else you wish to know?
47154 := There you are wrong, Revan. Without our help, you will never be able to enter the Temple of the Ancients. You will be trapped on this world forever.
47155 := You need us to get past the barrier that protects the Temple's exterior. Only the Rakata can perform the ritual to lower the shields. But we are not so sure we want to help you.
47156 := We trusted you once before, Revan - and you betrayed us. It is true you can enter the Temple and we cannot, but how can we trust you after last time?
47157 := There are many Rakata on this world, though most are primitive and war-like tribes descended from the lower castes of the Infinite Empire. The most powerful of all these is the tribe of the One.
47158 := Many times the warriors of the One's tribe have attacked our compound, hoping to gain the knowledge we guard. But our technology is far superior to theirs, and their attacks have failed.
47159 := We are the Elders, descended from the priest caste of the Infinite Empire. We are the keepers of knowledge and the guardians of the Temple of the Ancients.
47160 := During the collapse of the Rakata Empire, the warlords unleashed weapons of terrible destruction that threatened to drive our species to extinction.
47161 := In the devastation's aftermath our ancestors locked the knowledge of such technology away in the Temple so it could never be used again. Ever since then, we Elders have kept our vigil.
47162 := There is little I can tell you about the Temple. I know the secrets of our ancestors are contained within, but the Temple itself is barred to us. Only those who can command the Force can enter.
47163 := Long ago we Rakata had this power, but it has since been lost to us. That was why we helped you the last time you were here, Revan: you could enter the Temple, but we could not.
47164 := Even if you repair your ship, you will not be able to leave this world until you enter the Temple and disable the disruptor field that caused you to crash in the first place.
47165 := As for the parts you seek, that we cannot help you with. You might be able to salvage what you need if you explore some of the crash sites on this world.
47166 := But most of the wrecks are quickly raided and stripped by the more primitive and war-like Rakata tribes. Though they do not understand the technology, they hoard whatever they can carry.
47167 := Throughout the history of our world many ships have fallen victim to the disruptor field. Most within the ships perish in the crash, though some creatures do survive.
47168 := That is how the great war beasts you call rancors came to this world. A few of the beasts survived the crash, and they were captured and trained by some of the more primitive Rakata tribes.
47169 := We are the Elders, descendants of the Rakata priests who served during the days of the Infinite Empire over 20,000 of your galactic standard years ago. You met us the last time you came here.
47170 := First I have to slaughter all of you!
47171 := [Lie] Yes. I'm going there now to destroy it and Malak.
47172 := Maybe, but we should discuss this only after Malak is stopped.
47173 := I'm sure the galaxy will welcome you with open arms.
47174 := [Lie] Yes, I'm sure they'll welcome you with open arms.
47175 := You fools - I would never destroy the Star Forge!
47176 := Not exactly. I have to go to the Star Forge to stop Malak.
47177 := I've done my part. Now you have to honor our agreement.
47178 := So now you will help me?
47179 := Do you know where I can find parts to repair my ship?
47180 := I have questions about you: your tribe, your history, the Temple.
47181 := I have more questions about your history.
47182 := What do you know about the other Rakata here?
47183 := But don't you have the technology to destroy the One?
47184 := Have you tried reasoning with the One?
47185 := I can deal with them.
47186 := There's dark Jedi inside the Temple? How did they get in there?
47187 := Actually, I've decided I'm just going to kill you all!
47188 := How can I prove that?
47189 := Forget it!
47190 := So you want me to go there and kill the One?
47191 := Maybe I can negotiate with the One to release your hostage.
47192 := So if I save the prisoner you'll help me?
47193 := Okay, I'll help you. But I have some questions.
47194 := I'll be back after I rescue that prisoner!
47195 := Looks like we'll be working together, then.
47196 := I'll find some other way to enter the Temple!
47197 := [Persuade] I rescued one of your tribe from the One.
47198 := The One wants the ancient secrets you protect.
47199 := Give me what the One is after or I'll slaughter you all!
47200 := He promised to get me inside the Temple.
47201 := Enough talking. It's time for bloodshed!
47202 := Betrayed you? I don't even know you!
47203 := I'm not Revan anymore. That part of me is gone. I'm <FullName> now.
47204 := I have no clue what you are talking about.
47205 := I'm sorry, but I don't remember any of this.
47206 := My mind was destroyed. My memories were lost.
47207 := [Persuade/Lie] You can trust me. But first I have some questions.
47208 := [Persuade] You can trust me. But I have some questions for you.
47209 := This is a little overwhelming. I still don't remember anything.
47210 := Tell me about the last time I was here.
47211 := Thanks for the information. Looks like I don't need you anymore.
47212 := So if I promise to help you again, will you help me?
47213 := I want to know more about you. Tell me about the Rakata.
47214 := I want to know more about you, specifically.
47215 := And what about your tribe?
47216 := Tell me about the Temple of the Ancients.
47217 := I need parts to repair my ship.
47218 := Do a lot of ships crash because of the disruptor field?
47219 := More primitive tribes? You mean there are other Rakata?
47220 := You could tell me who you are, for starters.
47221 := Yes, Revan. What do you need?
47222 := Guards! Guards! We are under attack!
47223 := I will do my best to enlighten you with the knowledge I hold. What subject do you wish to learn about?
47224 := Much of our knowledge of the Star Forge is lost. It was built during the height of the Infinite Empire, long ago. All we know now is that it casts a terrible shadow across our world.
47225 := We Elders have longed to destroy the Star Forge for many generations, to cleanse ourselves of its evil presence. But we have neither the knowledge, nor the capability.
47226 := When you and Malak last came here, we saw you as saviors. We let you into the Temple so you could destroy the Star Forge, but instead you harnessed its dark power for yourselves.
47227 := You awakened a dormant evil, your fleet helped spread the corruption of the Star Forge throughout the galaxy. And now you return as our last hope to stop what you once started.
47228 := The Temple is a sacred place of terrible secrets. All the dark mysteries of the Rakata are housed within its stone walls, which pulse with the living power of the Ancients.
47229 := Only those who can command this power - what you call the Force - can enter the Temple. Many centuries ago there were still a few among us who could pass within its walls.
47230 := But living in the shadow of the Temple we became desensitized to this power. As you yourself said the last time you were here, we Elders are no longer 'Force sensitive'.
47231 := None of the Rakata can control the Force now, but long ago there were those who could pass through the barrier.
47232 := Our ancestors created the energy shield around the building as a second line of defense. But the energy shield was created using technology within the Temple itself.
47233 := Once we helped you and Malak to get past the barrier, you discovered a way to lower the shields at will from within the Temple itself. After this you had no further need of us.
47234 := The once hallowed ground of the Temple is now overrun with the followers of Malak who can command the Force: those you call the Dark Jedi.
47235 := Many centuries ago, the other Rakata began to emerge from the underground warrens where they had sought shelter from the devastation of the warlords.
47236 := But these Rakata were as violent as the warlords they had fled many millennia ago. After centuries of battle and bloodshed, the tribe of the One has emerged as the strongest of them all.
47237 := Now the One, lured by half-remembered legends of his people, lusts to possess the terrible power locked inside the Temple. We can never allow that to happen.
47238 := We have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.
47239 := We tried to negotiate with them. We went emissaries under a flag or truce when the One first arrived on this island. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.
47240 := The One is mad with power. We choose not to fight him, so our only course of action is to stay here in isolation where we are safe; just as we have done for the past 20,000 years.
47241 := When the One first arrived on this island, we sent emissaries under a flag of truce to try and negotiate with his tribe. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.
47242 := We do have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.
47243 := We Elders are descendants of the holy priest caste of the Infinite Empire, survivors of the terrible weapons unleashed by the warlords during the final collapse of our Empire.
47244 := Inside the Temple of the Ancients, our ancestors were safe from the devastation that forced the other Rakata to flee undergound. We emerged from the Temple to find an empty and ruined land.
47245 := At last we understood the terrible power of our own technology. To ensure it could never be unleashed upon us again, we sealed the ancient knowledge within the Temple. 
47246 := Long ago the Rakata ruled all the known galaxy; all the species bowed down to us. But we were a corrupt people, and in our fall from glory there are terrible lessons that must be learned.
47247 := The Infinite Empire was built on slaughter; it was inevitable it should collapse upon itself. War, plague and slave rebellion forced us to retreat back here to our hidden home world.
47248 := Here, conflict among power-hungry warlords escalated into full civil war. Terrible weapons of mass destruction were unleashed, driving most of the Rakata far beneath the earth for shelter.
47249 := The devastation ravaged the world. Our people were scattered, our cities levelled, our very existence all but erased. The glory of the Infinite Empire is now nothing but dust and bones.
47250 := In the past few thousand years small bands of Rakata have begun to return to the surface, but they are primitive and superstitious creatures. Only we Elders remember anything of the true past.
47251 := Long ago, we Rakata were a great space-faring people. Our ships combined techonolgy and the power of the Force, and we were able to pilot them to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.
47252 := Everywhere we went, we found civilizations less advanced and weaker then our own. But instead of helping them advance, we conquered and enslaved them.
47253 := Back then, we could still command the Force. That, combined with our advanced technolgy made our march of conquest irresistable. Soon the Infinite Empire stretched across the entire galaxy.
47254 := Over time, we lost our ability to use the Force. Some believe we had used the Force for so long that we evolved biologically, and became immune to its effects.
47255 := In any case, once we lost our sensitivity to the Force our Empire began to fracture. We had to revert to more conventional space travel using inferior technology. Our ultimate collapse was inevitable.
47256 := We do not have what you need, but the tribe of the One often take pieces from the ships that crash onto the planet, though they do not understand the technology they are hoarding.
47257 := You might find the parts you need in their camp, back towards the beach where your ship first crashed. Or you could try to salvage the parts you need from the wrecks scattered about the island.
47258 := The disruptor field is one of the ancient defenses of the Star Forge; a great generator within the Temple of the Ancients fuels it. You will have to enter the Temple to disable it.
47259 := Greetings once again, Revan. I am glad that you have returned. I couldn't believe that you had betrayed us, despite what the Council said.
47260 := My name is Orsaa. I am the Keeper of History for the Elders. The last time you were here you had many questions for me.
47261 := The Council told us all of the destruction of your memories, but still I had hoped you might recall something of our past discussion.
47262 := Yes, of course. You have much to do, and little enough time to do it. But if you ever have any questions for me, I will be happy to try and answer them.
47263 := Yes, of course. Although you must forgive me if some of this starts to seem familiar. After all, we did go into the history of the Rakata at some length the last time you were here.
47264 := Yes, I suppose that is true. As you can imagine, I have few opportunities to share my knowledge with those outside our enclave. 
47265 := There is no need to apologize. It just pains me to know that all you had learned from me has been forgotten. Still, I would be happy to instruct you again.
47266 := I'm here to kill you all!
47267 := I want to ask you some questions.
47268 := Can you tell me about the Star Forge?
47269 := What do you know about the Temple of the Ancients?
47270 := So why is there an energy field outside the Temple then?
47271 := Can any of the Rakata enter the Temple?
47272 := What do you know about the other Rakata tribes here?
47273 := Can't you just use your technology to destroy the One?
47274 := Have you tried reasoning with the One?
47275 := Tell me about the tribe of Elders.
47276 := How did the Rakata Empire collapse?
47277 := Thanks for the information. I guess I can kill you now!
47278 := I want to ask you about something else.
47279 := Tell me about the beginnings of the Rakata Empire.
47280 := Do you know where I can find parts to repair my ship?
47281 := Do you know how to disable the disruptor field that caused my ship to crash?
47282 := I'm sorry, I don't remember you.
47283 := Who are you?
47284 := I have to go now.
47285 := You're a historian? Maybe I could ask you some questions.
47286 := Look on the bright side: we can have all those discussions again.
47287 := I wish I could remember, but I don't. Sorry.
47288 := Maybe later.
47289 := Actually, I do have a few questions for you.
47290 := I wish that we could fully trust you after your long absence, Revan... but I do not know if we can.
47291 := The keeper of our history can help you if there is anything you wish to know.
47292 := The Council thinks you may help us... I hope that they are right.
47293 := The work of our people must go on... to preserve our future.
47294 := You promised to help us last time, Revan. I hope that you live up to your word.
47295 := You have helped us at last! Finally we shall be able to reclaim our past!
47296 := In time, I hope our tribe can unify our race once more.
47297 := The other Rakata assaulted us mercilessly... but our defenses drove them back.
47298 := There are many unanswered questions about your last trip into the Temple, Revan... but those shall have to wait.
47299 := If you wish to know more about us, speak to our keeper of history.
47300 := I hope that you find what you seek in the Temple, Revan, and that you help us as well.
47301 := At last we can regain our place in the galaxy! Our thanks, Revan.

47332 := I can't wait to see what havoc your magics will wreak on the Elders!
47333 := I await the day when your tasks are done and you will have time to teach me, Master.
47334 := I hope that someday, you will find me worthy to teach, Master.
47335 := You entered the Elders' compound and returned alive!
47336 := I knew your magic was strong, but this is amazing! Maybe someday I could wield magic too!
47337 := Would you... teach me, Master?
47338 := I... I understand, Master... I hope that someday you will reconsider and find me worthy of your tutelage.
47339 := You are the one who defeated our warriors in combat, aren't you?
47340 := The one who wields the magic to defeat the Elders?
47341 := Of course. None could make you do that which you do not desire.
47342 := It is glorious to see such a power come to our aid when all was thought lost here on this gods-forsaken island.
47343 := To be able to command the elements in such a way is awesome to behold... and must be even more so to wield.
47344 := Please, great one, enlighten me to the scope of the power you wield... this 'Force'.
47345 := I am sorry for not comprehending your great powers. What then, are they?
47346 := Project your will? To force things to be the way you want?
47347 := You are truly great in your power and your wisdom.
47348 := The strong of will... with the will to power. Yes, yes I see!
47349 := Just as you are able to change this destiny we are in, this... stagnation. You, with your power, can break the Elders' power and free us to move on!
47350 := A natural energy? Like fire and lightning?
47351 := 'Genetically'? Is it that only your people can use the magic? There have been tales from the past of Rakata wielding magic, as the Elders do now.
47352 := But maybe you mean something greater, something in all peoples that can harness its power.
47353 := Such power! If only we Rakata could wield that power, too...
47354 := Flows from life?
47355 := The power over life gives you magic to create and destroy?
47356 := All beings are connected? Through some sort of life Force?
47357 := I will not teach one as worthless as you!
47358 := I will teach you in time. I'm busy now.
47359 := You are not strong enough to wield the Force.
47360 := I decide what I will do!
47361 := I will see what can be done about the Elders.
47362 := I wield the Force, yes.
47363 := You don't know the half of it...
47364 := The Force is not merely the elements!
47365 := I think you misunderstand what the Force is...
47366 := The true nature of the Force is being able to project your will upon reality.
47367 := One as weak as yourself could not see the true power of it.
47368 := The strong of will can have whatever they desire.
47369 := The only true Force is to be able to change destiny.
47370 := The Force is a natural energy that gifted people can use.
47371 := Fire that only genetically gifted people can use.
47372 := It is like being able to shoot lightning from your fingertips.
47373 := Much more powerful than just lightning.
47374 := The Force is a power that flows from all life in the universe.
47375 := It is the combined affinity that all life hold for each other.
47376 := Life itself generates the Force.
47377 := It connects all living beings in the universe.
47378 := The loremaster will surely be interested in the stories you have gained since leaving us last, Revan.
47379 := The One has said that we must let you aid yourself to what we may have so that you may overcome the Elders.
47380 := You betrayed us last time you were here, Revan. Do not let this happen again.
47381 := You have done us a great help by removing the Elders from our way. Now we can at last gain entrance to the Temple.
47382 := When we have defeated the Elders, then at last can we leave this cursed island.
47383 := The war against the Elders will soon be over with you on our side.
47384 := The Elders have held us up here long enough. Now, with your help, we can at last break this stalemate.
47385 := With the secrets of the Temple in our grasp, we can at last complete our conquest of the world!
47386 := Greetings once again. How may the loremaster of our tribe serve you now?
47387 := Other survivors? You mean others who have crashed onto this world as you have?
47388 := Yes, there have been others... Others who wield powers like yours, whose weapons spit fire and light. They have killed many of our warriors and we hunt them down as we can.
47389 := Perhaps there are some among them who would prove useful... but we cannot take the chance of that in our lessened state.
47390 := It is a large structure, the like of which we have seen on no other island anywhere. It's architecture resembles our own, but on a vastly greater scale.
47391 := We believe that it may have been built in an age long past by our forebears, but none can understand it now. The Elders may hold the key to it, but they will not divulge it, and we cannot take it from them by force.
47392 := The One believes that this Temple may bring him the power to unify the entire world beneath his banner.
47393 := The nature of this power escapes me, but I cannot deny his vision. The barriers around it keep us from entering, the power of the Elders seems to draw upon it, and we can see strange objects rise from it into the sky regularly.
47394 := When we tried to assault the Elders' compound, we were met by defenses of caged lightning and beams of light that cut warriors in half just by touching them, or turned them into charred meat in an instant.
47395 := Many warriors died there... their bodies forming a new wall for the Elders' defence...
47396 := The Temple too, uses light, though this time as a shield to block us from entering... We believe they may be connected somehow.
47397 := There is a strong barrier of light guarding the front entrance to the Temple. We cannot breach this barrier. Our attempts to go around through other entrances have also met with failure.
47398 := No one who has tried to enter the temple through other means, or travelled to the island at its far side has ever returned...
47399 := Objects come and go from the far end of the temple frequently. We do not know what manner of thing they are, but we suspect they are like our boats... boats that ride on air.
47400 := If we could make these boats our own, nothing would escape our grasp!
47401 := We know the Elders are Rakata like us, but different as well. They control strange powers and magics that we cannot understand.
47402 := When we came to this island, drawn by the strange structure we call the Temple of the Ancients, we were expecting perhaps a few survivors... but not another race of Rakata.
47403 := The One's troops captured a few of their scouts, but we could learn nothing intelligible from them. Attacks against their compound were fruitless and reaped terrible casualties.
47404 := We came here with near a thousand warriors... and you can see now what we are reduced to... They cower in their fortress and we are powerless to root them out.
47405 := This is why the One thinks we need your help once again. You were able to enter the Elders' compound before... perhaps you can again.
47406 := You came to us shortly after we had arrived on this island, before we had yet constructed this settlement.
47407 := You came to us after defeating our scouts who confronted you, much as you have again this time. The One saw your power... and your desire for the knowledge inside the Temple.
47408 := We had not yet attacked the Elders' compound, but we knew of their presence... and the depths of their knowledge. We advised you that the answers you sought may lie with them.
47409 := We made a pact, an agreement, that if we could breach their compound together and take their secrets, we would do all we could to help you enter the Temple as well.
47410 := Then you found a way into the Elders' compound, and we never heard from you again...
47411 := The great story of the One would take many days to tell in its entirety. It is my specialty, of course.
47412 := What would you like to know of his great story?
47413 := After he had conquered his own island, and his army had grown to a large size, he turned his eyes towards the nearest other islands in the archipelago.
47414 := With each island that fell to him, his army grew stronger, his wisdom greater with each chief given up to him, and his vision of a future for our people brighter.
47415 := Before long he had conquered every island in a month's sailing and had armies expanding in every direction. It seemed that nothing would stand against him then.
47416 := But we heard of the Temple of the Ancients here, on this forgotten island at the edge of the True Sea, and the One was intrigued. It was a place of power, to be sure, and none could doubt its significance.
47417 := Driven by portents and omens, we came to this island with a thousand of his finest warriors... and here we stay...
47418 := We cannot leave while the Temple stands unopened, but we cannot enter while the Elders stand against us... and the One sits each day brooding on the fate that has led us to this impasse.
47419 := By adulthood, the One was held in awe by those of his tribe as both a warrior and a leader. When he challenged the chieftain of his tribe, no one doubted that he would prevail.
47420 := The chieftain could see and, knowing that the One would bring the tribe into greatness, offered himself up without a fight. The tribe fed well and was stronger for his sacrifice.
47421 := Under the leadership of the One, his tribe conquered all others on the island, capturing and subduing their warriors, feasting on their chieftains, and growing his own army at the same time.
47422 := He was truly a force that could not be stopped, a leader unlike any we have seen in our history. He will be the one to unite us all!
47423 := Born to poverty, raised in a hovel with no elders to guide him and share their strength with him, he had nothing to rely on but himself.
47424 := But in his weakness, he was uniquely destined for strength and the burdens it carries with it.
47425 := Even in his youth, it was obvious that the One was destined for greatness. When but a youngling, he defeated one of the strange blue-armored warriors who fall from the sky and feasted upon him.
47426 := The respect from his battle gave him the step he needed to go forward on a path that has led him ever upward since.
47427 := What of our people would you like to know?
47428 := We... we heard of the temple on this island... the Temple of the Ancients. A building the like of which has not been seen anywhere else. A place of great power it was reputed, with great guardians as well.
47429 := The One came here with an army to see this temple and seize it for our cause, but we were met with strange and powerful magics which have defeated us at every turn.
47430 := So now the One sits here and broods on his troubles, listening only to the messengers who bear his orders to all corners of his territory.
47431 := If only the riddle of the temple could be solved, and its guardian Elders removed, then he would consume their flesh and knowledge and bring unity to our people.
47432 := It is my sincere hope as well, that you can help us with our great task.
47433 := Before none were strong enough to bind together the tribes and unite them towards a common goal, but that changed. Now we do have a leader, and under him, we have swept across the islands, conquering all who have stood before us.
47434 := Over the last 20 years we have conquered over a hundred islands, both large and small. The One has led us to victory where none have before, further strengthening us with the blood of our enemies.
47435 := We have subjugated many tribes as well, their warriors joining ours in our great crusade.
47436 := But recently, things have not gone so well...
47437 := More and more outsiders fall from the sky and kill our people. More and more tribes resist us, or even rebel!
47438 := It has taken a great part of our strength to resist, but under the One, we shall prevail! Nothing shall stop him from forming the Second Empire!
47439 := Our civilization lapsed back into savagery. We were no longer the great people of centuries past.
47440 := Brother turned on brother, tribesman on tribesman, until all fought and sought to destroy each other.
47441 := The legacy of the final war and the collapse that came after it still echo with us today. We are still a fractured people. Many tribes dwell on these islands, warring with each other constantly.
47442 := Each seeks to grow its own strength, absorbing that of its enemies through their flesh cut down in battle, but none has been strong enough to exert their influence over more than a handful of islands. Until now that is...
47443 := We now are in the midst of a great war of reformation, of reclamation.
47444 := Our skin had been hardened and turned black from the time our people spent beneath the surface, but always at the fringes of society there were rumors... rumors of those of others colors who survived above the surface while we dwelt below.
47445 := We can pinpoint no direct cause for the collapse of the First Empire, but it was swift and total. What had taken centuries to build and was maintained for thousands of years disappeared within ten, perhaps twenty, years.
47446 := From the ancient cities we have examined, there was much fighting and death, as well as fires that burned bright and hot enough to melt the stones of their palaces to glass.
47447 := Also, in scattered fragments and records, we have heard of a people being found... a people unlike the Rakata but taking our form, who waged a monumental war that tore civilization apart.
47448 := What this war was, or who those beings were we do not know, but they are the demons of our legends now. We believe them to be gone, wiped out in that vast conflagration, but we cannot know for sure...
47449 := With the first civilizations of our people destroyed, and chaos and anarchy sweeping the islands, it seemed that a time of darkness had descended upon us that would never end.
47450 := But a strong nation of survivors yet endured. On one of the smaller islands near the equatorial regions, they had not forgotten the oldest traditions, those learned from the gods of the earth while we dwelt beneath the surface.
47451 := Taking the knowledge of their elders and passing their wisdom and skills on to the next generation by eating their flesh, they built a culture unrivalled throughout history. Greater, even, than your vaunted 'Republic'.
47452 := For millennia this empire stood, uniting the many islands of our world into one cohesive whole. Each generation passing its strength on to the one that followed.
47453 := But... fate was unkind to these great Rakata, these first ones of our kind to rise above savagery and create a true, lasting civilization.
47454 := Back in the days of the first awakening, when our people rose from the ground and brought the light of civilization to our new world, our people spread far and wide across all the islands.
47455 := Among these peoples, there were some that rose to greatness on the largest islands. Rakatans of vision and forethought who built great monuments to themselves and their leaders.
47456 := But these cultures did not know their true strengths. They did not draw upon the knowledge of their past to feed their present.
47457 := Of course these cultures, with their centers of learning and their great temples, collapsed in riots and chaos, burning their cultures from the world in an orgy of violence.
47458 := It was a thousand years of darkness before the light of First Empire rose upon the blood of the past.
47459 := The world is ruled by the gods of the earth and sky, both living and dead.
47460 := When the sky gods remade the world, the gods of the earth, who had sheltered and protected the Rakata, were gone. Whether dead of asleep, they have not been heard from again.
47461 := Nor do the gods in the sky listen to our pleas any longer, although we can still see their lights gleam in the heavens.
47462 := So we mortal Rakata are left here to our own devices... to make the future we demand for ourselves.
47463 := In the times before our most ancient histories, there was nothing you could call the Rakatan people. There were unintelligent proto-Rakata wandering the surface of this world.
47464 := Spawned from the womb of this world, they were gifted with the brilliance of thought, but not tempered with the wisdom to use it.
47465 := When the gods of the sky first spoke to them, the ground shook and heaved, and fires raced across the surface of the world. They fled beneath the ground to escape the calamity and dwelled there for some time.
47466 := At last the gods spoke to them in dreams... dreams of the surface and the light. They re-emerged from the ground and found the land much changed around them.
47467 := Gone were the plains and valleys they had known. Instead, there were islands stretching across the breadth of the world. The world had been remade for them by the gods of the sky, and they gave thanks in fear and gratitude.
47468 := You have returned from the Temple... as I knew you would. You shall have an honored place in our histories, Revan.
47469 := The Rakata people shall always be indebted to you.
47470 := Greetings, Revan, I am Gjarshi, the loremaster of our tribe.
47471 := I am the keeper of our histories and chronicler of the conquests of the One.
47472 := If you must. I shall remain here as I always do, listening to those who wish to speak... and remembering.
47473 := It does not matter to me what path you choose. History flows in mysterious ways and my task is only to witness and remember which course it takes.
47474 := Your actions then, as now, are memories to be passed on to future generations. When you are dead and gone, your memory shall remain with us.
47475 := The position of loremaster is a sacred and respected one among our people. We are the keepers of history, the ones who pass down the traditions of our people.
47476 := I am here to chronicle the conquests and achievements of the One. I have followed his exploits for many years... and yours as well.
47477 := When last you came to this island, the One had just arrived with his army. We spoke then, as now, and you told me of your travels and stories about the worlds beyond ours.
47478 := You spoke of the magical Force you wielded which gave you power over the elements.
47479 := But then you left us and went back to the stars, never to be heard from again. We wondered what had happened, what could have gone wrong, but could do nothing against you, or the Elders.
47480 := We know the Elders are Rakata like us, but different as well. They control strange powers and magics that we cannot understand.
47481 := When we came to this island, drawn by the strange structure we call the Temple of the Ancients, we were expecting perhaps a few survivors... but not another race of Rakata.
47482 := The One's troops captured a few of their scouts, but we could learn nothing intelligible from them. Attacks against their compound were fruitless and reaped terrible casualties.
47483 := We came here with near a thousand warriors... and you can see now what we are reduced to...
47484 := This is why the One thinks we need your help once again. You were able to enter the Elders' compound once before... perhaps you can again.
47485 := Your life has been defined by your identity Revan, your fate. If you no longer wish me to call you this, then I shall not, but you cannot change who you are.
47486 := As you will. I know better than to argue with you when you have set your mind to something.
47487 := Do you know anything about other survivors?
47488 := Tell me of the Temple of the Ancients.
47489 := How is the Elders' power similar?
47490 := How are you prevented from entering?
47491 := Strange objects?
47492 := Tell me of the Elders.
47493 := What happened the last time I was here?
47494 := Tell me of the One.
47495 := I'd like to know something else.
47496 := Tell me of his conquests.
47497 := Tell me of how he came to power.
47498 := Tell me how he was raised.
47499 := Tell me the history of your people.
47500 := What is the One doing here, then?
47501 := Tell me of the war of reformation.
47502 := How long has this war been waged?
47503 := How many islands have you conquered?
47504 := This leader... is it the One?
47505 := What happened after the collapse of the First Empire?
47506 := Tell me what happened to the First Empire.
47507 := Tell me of the First Empire.
47508 := Tell me of your first civilizations.
47509 := Tell me of the gods you mentioned.
47510 := Tell me how your people came to be.
47511 := I must go now.
47512 := Do you not hate me for leaving your people before?
47513 := You are a loremaster? What do you do? Memorize books?
47514 := Can you tell me of the history of your people?
47515 := Tell me of the One.
47516 := You know nothing of me!
47517 := Mine?
47518 := Tell me of the Elders.
47519 := I am not Revan any more! I am <FullName>!
47520 := A person decides their own fate!
47521 := *groan*
47522 := You... you have saved me from the savages and their war beasts...
47523 := They... they were trying to find out how to breach our defenses and gain entry to our camp... My comrades, they... they wouldn't tell them.
47524 := I'm sure that, had you not come, I would have ended up as they did.
47525 := Yes... Of the four of us that they had captured, only I remain...
47526 := I am one of the Elders, the other remaining tribe of Rakata on this island.
47527 := The tribe you have fought has attempted to destroy us and seize our secrets to gain access to the Temple of the Ancients... Thus far, they have failed.
47528 := The field? We... may.
47529 := You should speak with the Council of our tribe... They may be able to help you for what you have done for me.
47530 := The Temple to the east of here... the largest structure on the island.
47531 := I don't know what I could have done if you had not come. I suppose I would be dead now, like the others they captured with me.
47532 := Thank you for saving me. I shall attempt to return to the Enclave on my own. I will tell the Council of what you have done.
47533 := What did they do to you?
47534 := Why did they capture you?
47535 := You are the only surviving prisoner?
47536 := Who are you?
47537 := Do you know anything about the disruptor field surrounding this world?
47538 := Temple of the Ancients?
47539 := I was sent by the Council to save you.
47540 := Then we shall feast upon your flesh, Revan!
47541 := You refuse to help us? Is that why you returned, Revan? To tell us you have broken your vow?
47542 := No one defies the will of the One, Revan - not even you! My war beasts will destroy you, and the tribe will feast on your bones!
47543 := I have given you free reign within our camp, Revan. Take whatever supplies you may need from our caches, if you think it will help you destroy the Elders and recover the ancient tome.
47544 := I am the One, warrior-chieftain of this tribe. Answering questions is the work of Gjarshi, our Loremaster. Seek him out if you wish to know of our tribe.
47545 := But I will answer no more questions. The time for questions is done: now you must fulfill your promise. Slay the Elders and bring us their secrets. This is the will of the One.
47546 := This tome does not hold the great secrets I was hoping for. Although it contains many rituals, only one appears to be of any real consequence.
47547 := The knowledge of magic and power is locked away within the Temple itself. And this book is the key to the Temple, for only the rituals in this tome can lower the shields protecting it. 
47548 := I will honor our agreement, Revan. There is little reason for me to betray you, in any case.
47549 := None among my tribe - or perhaps none among any of the Rakata - has this power. Only you can enter the Temple, Revan. But you cannot do it without our help.
47550 := You can pass the barrier at the entrance, but you cannot get past the shield that surrounds the Temple. Only the ancient ritual, performed by those of pure Rakata blood, can lower the shield.
47551 := My priests can prepare and perform the ritual whenever you are ready, Revan. But in accordance with the traditions within the ritual tome, you must enter the Temple alone.
47552 := You have entered the Temple, Revan. You have seen the great secrets of the Ancients. Now you must fulfill your oath and share these secrets with me, Revan.
47553 := Do you take me for a fool, Revan? You are hoarding the secrets for yourself! You will leave us and forget about us, just as you did the last time you were here.
47554 := But this time you will not be allowed to escape with the knowledge that is rightfully mine, Revan! My war beasts will destroy you!
47555 := And so you have betrayed us, Revan - just as you did the last time you were here. 
47556 := You vowed to kill the Elders and bring us the secret knowledge they protect. In exchange, we promised to use this lost knowledge to help you enter the Temple of the Ancients.
47557 := When you vanished, we thought you had forgotten us - or been killed by the Elders. Now that you have returned our alliance still holds: destroy the Elders, and we will help you.
47558 := I am certain this ancient tome will allow me to unleash what has, for so long, been hidden by the Elders. Bring me this book and I will use the knowledge within it to help you enter the Temple.
47559 := When you have it, bring it here to me. Until then, you may move freely about our village. I will be waiting for your return.
47560 := Computer? That is a word our prisoners have used. When we forced them to explain it to us, they said this 'computer' was some type of thinking machine. More magic we cannot understand.
47561 := Before they died, some prisoners did speak of such a machine inside their compound. But I do not believe it has anything to do with the secrets they are trying to protect.
47562 := When last you were here, you and Malak sought to enter the Temple. You sought ancient knowledge and a way to escape this world within its stone walls.
47563 := As a show of good faith, I will allow you to search the stores of our tribe, and take whatever you find. In exchange, I know you will destroy the Elders and bring the secrets they guard back to me.
47564 := Dead? Is this why you returned, Revan? To tell us that you have fulfilled your oath? If this is true, then there is something I must ask you.
47565 := Enough talking. I think I'll just kill you now!
47566 := Forget it. I'll never help you against the Elders!
47567 := I want to ask you some questions.
47568 := Here is the ancient tome.
47569 := You better not be looking to double-cross me here!
47570 := So now you know how to get inside the Temple?
47571 := That's not my problem! We had a deal!
47572 := [Lie] I don't have the secrets on me, but I'll get them for you soon.
47573 := The information you wanted was all on computers. You couldn't use it.
47574 := You are a fool! I only used you to get into the Temple!
47575 := Vow? I don't remember any vow.
47576 := What was this vow, exactly?
47577 := If I kill the Elders, how can I bring you their secrets?
47578 := [Lie] Don't worry. I will slay the Elders and honor our deal.
47579 := I'll be back when I get that book.
47580 := So where is this information? Is it in some kind of computer?
47581 := Why do you think that?
47582 := The Elders are dead. I killed them myself.

48149 := Advanced Stabilizer Gloves
48150 := These gloves contain an advanced fire control and trajectory analysis system which links to held ranged weapons. This allows the user greater accuracy when aiming their own weapons, and also gives warning when incoming fire would likely hit the wearer.
48151 := Advanced Sensory Implant
48152 := By assisting the areas of the user's brain dedicated to sensory-interpretation, this implant greatly heightens the user's awareness of their surroundings, as well as spatial perception and analysis.
48153 := Advanced Bio-Stabilizer Implant
48155 := This detailed micro-computer analyzes the contents of the user's circulatory system, as well as surges and drops in nerve transmission rates. It attempts to stabilize the user's system, and remove undesirable elements from it.
48156 := Light Exoskeleton
48157 := Special:
Upgradeable, Armor

A relatively new type of power-assisted armor, this suit mimics the major muscle movements of the wearer with mechanical impulses, resulting in greater strength and faster reaction times.

48158 := Baragwin Shadow Armor
48159 := Special:
Upgradeable, Armor

A specialty of the Baragwin, this modifiable suit has advanced adaptive camouflage technology that, when combined with a stealth generator, allows it to blend in nearly seamlessly with the background when viewed from any direction. It is generally only sold to respected governments, but a number have found their way into more disreputable distribution channels.

48160 := Baragwin Assault Blade
48161 := Special:
Upgradeable, Melee

This advanced vibrosword is a miracle of miniaturization technology. Not only does it deliver increased functionality over a normal vibrosword, it also has capacitors which discharge upon contact with a target. Extra space within the blade can be utilized by a variety of common upgrade modules.
48162 := Advanced Combat Implant
48163 := The Advanced Combat Implant is an experimental technology, designed to make computer data available to the user. Naturally, one of the first uses for this technology was combat. This implant contains weapons specification, and advanced usage techniques for all known weaponry in the Republic and associated territories.
48164 := Advanced Bio-Stabilizer Mask
48165 := Similar to the Advanced Bio-Stabilizer Implant, this mask analyzes circulation patterns through the skin, monitors breathing through chemical sensors, and reactions through eye movements. It additionally acts as a nearly complete environmental system, preventing toxins from ever reaching the wearer.
48166 := Heavy Exoskeleton
48167 := Special:
Upgradeable, Armor

A heavy and durable suit, this mechanical exoskeleton provides much greater strength and endurance, and vastly improved armor protection to the wearer than lighter models. With additional enhancements, this capability can be expanded even further, rivaling some light armored vehicles for protection.

48168 := Environmental Bastion Armor
48169 := Special:
Upgradeable, Armor

A modified environmental suit, this armor gives the wearer complete protection from the elements as well as superior combat protection. With additional enhancements, it can be converted into a completely contained environmental system and shield the wearer from outside radiation as well.

48170 := Baragwin Assault Gun
48171 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

This light repeating blaster is an excellent example of the Baragwin aptitude for weaponry. By taking and modifying an existing repeating blaster design, the Baragwin have managed to greatly increase the damage output and added additional functionality with a variety of upgrade options.
48172 := Baragwin Ion-X Weapon
48173 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

This weapon is an experimental Baragwin design that has been extensively modified by Suvam Tan. He has incorporated what he describes as a 'shaped-energy' delivery system into the weapon, which allows it to deliver concussive force on impact in addition to the weapon's normal energy discharge. Upgrades to the weapon could potentially greatly increase both its impact force and its penetration.
48174 := Baragwin Flame Thrower
48175 := Using an innovative technique, the Baragwin have managed to modify a normal flame thrower to operate in such a fashion as to ignite the very atmosphere around a charged guidance beam. The result is a flame thrower that doesn't need an external fuel source and can be run virtually indefinitely.
48176 := Baragwin Stun Ray
48177 := While not the most powerful of weapons, the Baragwin have modified a normal Stun Ray to run at such efficiency that it can tap into the power supply of the droid mounting it, giving it unlimited charges.
48178 := Baragwin Shield Disruptor
48179 := The Baragwin have tweaked and tuned a normal Shield Disruptor to be able to run off the mounting droid's power supply, giving it unlimited charges.
48180 := Composite Heavy Plating
48181 := This plating forgoes mobility in favor of sheer mass. The huge composite plates covering the droid do not allow the range of motion that other armor systems may grant their user, but in terms of physical protection, this plating is the best in the galaxy.
48182 := Baragwin Droid Shield
48183 := A super-efficient version of a normal droid energy shield, the Baragwin version has been modified and customized to be able to run off the power supply of the droid mounting it. While the energy drain on the droid is insignificant, the protection gained is equal, if not superior, to a normal light droid energy shield.
48184 := Baragwin Stealth Unit
48185 := Similar in concept to the Baragwin Shadow Armor, the Baragwin Stealth Unit is a quantum leap in advancement over standard stealth units. It provides much greater camouflage, as well as enhancing the mobility and situational awareness of the wearer to potential threats.
48186 := Advanced Alacrity Impant
48187 := By fine-tuning the user's nervous system, this implant allows vastly improved reaction times and coordination over unmodified individuals. The success of this implant, though not in wide distribution due to its cost, has prompted some at rival Bavakar Medical Research Labs to call for it to be banned.
48188 := Medical Interface Visor
48189 := Similar in functionality to the Bio-Stabilizer series of medical equipment, this visor is designed to assist in the care and treatment of injured individuals. By providing constant data and analysis on the condition of the patient, this visor greatly increases the chance of survival of even the most critically injured of patients.
48190 := Advanced Agent Interface
48191 := A visor with an integrated computer and electronics analysis system, the Advanced Agent Interface uses a superior artificial intelligence routine to assist the wearer in all manner of covert and computer-oriented tasks. It can also be used to connect to a secure computer via physical cables, enabling the AI to act on its own to breach that system.
48192 := Baragwin Heavy Repeating Blaster
48193 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

A heavier version of the Baragwin Assault Gun, this weapon features similar improvements over its more common version. The incredible amounts of energy contained in the beam can be upgraded even further to produce a blast capable of setting even durasteel on fire for brief periods.
48194 := Baragwin Disruptor-X Weapon
48195 := Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged

Using the same 'shaped-energy' concept as in his Ion-X Weapon, Suvam Tan has modified a Baragwin disruptor weapon as well, giving comparable levels of concussive force to the blast that the Ion-X Weapon delivers. Upgrades to this weapon could potentially greatly increase both the impact force and the penetration of its charges.
48196 := Advanced Droid Interface
48198 := A self-contained artificial intelligence system, this module can be equipped on droids to provide them with additional resources useful in the bypassing of computer and conventional security systems. This AI extends the current capabilities of the mounting droid to a level typically only seen on military espionage droids.
48199 := Heart of the Guardian
48200 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Though its origins have been lost, the legendary artifact known as the Heart of the Guardian was rumored to have been instrumental in the founding of the guardian order of Jedi. Nothing further is mentioned in any Jedi archive, but both Sith and Jedi whisper their own legends. According to the Jedi, the Heart will appear in a time of greatest turmoil and deliver the galaxy into salvation. The Sith, however, believe it to be an object of their heritage, which will bring the galaxy under their dominion.
 
The Heart of the Guardian appears to be a magnificently shaped lightsaber crystal of unknown composition. Analysis by Suvam Tan has yielded inconclusive results, not being able to identify what mineral it's made of. Suvam has even begun to wonder if it is a normal crystal at all, for at times it almost seems as if it were alive.

All known lightsaber crystals seem to have a strange resonance with the Heart of the Guardian, their properties being altered or enhanced when in close proximity to it. Additionally, energy focused through the Heart results in a beam of unique clarity and color.
48201 := Mantle of the Force
48203 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

The Mantle of the Force is an item assembled by Suvam Tan from pieces found in the ruins of Exar Kun's temples on the fourth moon orbiting Yavin. It appears to be the remains of an even older artifact of unknown origin. It is not known if it was used by Exar Kun, or just uncovered when his temples were destroyed. Nor is it known what the original properties of the item were, but given the current abilities, in its original state it must have been fearsome indeed.

The Mantle is a crystalline lattice, resembling a lightsaber crystal in many ways, but having the additional property of being able to radically alter the flow of energy that passes through it. When combined with other crystals, the Mantle warps their properties, often enhancing them to incredible levels.

Additionally, the Mantle seems to almost act as a focusing tool for Force-sensitive individuals, leading to the idea that the original artifact may once have been a powerful tool of the Sith, or perhaps something they took with them when the dark Jedi originally split from the Order.

48650 := Damn gizka...
48651 := What do you want?
48652 := I know those Trandoshan lizards are waiting to strike again. Just a matter of time.
48653 := What can I do for you?
48654 := Well, you're back. I was just taking a look at a few new things I thought you might like and I...
48655 := You?? How did you get in here?!
48656 := We have our ways, rodian. Just because you didn't hear us dock, doesn't mean we can't. And your own stealth units have proven most... effective.
48657 := [Failure] I think not, human. Not this time.
48658 := I think not, human.
48659 := We're here to teach you a lesson, Suvam. And you as well, human. Unfortunately, you won't live to correct your mistakes.
48660 := Those Trandoshan scum! They couldn't get more out of me, so they tried to kill me instead!
48661 := Hopefully, I'll have time before they send someone else to investigate... maybe rig their ship to take off somewhere else...
48662 := Thank you for your help, at least. I know I couldn't have taken them on my own.
48663 := I'll let you look at my special stash. It's the stuff I wasn't showing them. It won't be cheap, but if you want it, you can buy it.
48664 := Eh? Oh, you're back again. Well, I don't know how much longer I'm going to be here. I keep thinking the Trandoshans will be coming back in force... and I don't want to be around when they do.
48665 := I appreciate your help and all, but there's no way I can fight an army of those lizards, not even with your help.
48666 := [Failure] Yes, I... No, no... What am I thinking of, I can't do something like that!
48667 := [Failure] Ha! No, no. I think I can handle them by myself.
48668 := I was thinking of maybe looking up some of my old Baragwin friends... if any of them are still alive.
48669 := No, no, I'll be fine on my own. There's nothing that can be done sometimes, and I think I should move on anyway. This place is getting too old.
48670 := Eh? That's the kind of gratitude I get? Well, I should have expected it from you...
48671 := I don't know how much longer I'll be here, so if you come around again and I'm gone, don't come looking.
48672 := Hah! And don't expect me to leave all the good stuff lying around the place either. It's coming with me.
48673 := If there's anything you want, now's the time to buy it 'cause there's no guarantee it'll be here next time.
48674 := [Failure] I... What? No I don't! I don't know what you're trying to pull, but don't do it again!
48675 := Now do you want to buy something or not?
48676 := [Success] Well, yeah, sure, I guess I can. You have a good face I think.
48677 := A little odd, perhaps... but good.
48678 := Suit yourself, suit yourself.
48679 := Hm... I don't rightly know, yet. I was thinking of maybe looking up some of my old Baragwin friends... if any of them are still alive.
48680 := I managed to scavenge enough pieces to fit my ship out with a hyperspace drive, so I'll spend some time trying to find them on my own I think.
48681 := Now... what can I do for you?
48682 := It's a lot better seeing you than those Trandoshans again. There anything I can do for you now, though?
48683 := They want me to give them more of my inventions... stuff that I haven't even finished working on yet!
48684 := Ever since Davik went down, the Exchange has been a non-factor in these parts. The Trandoshans are trying to muscle in on all the old Exchange businesses now.
48685 := Maybe I can still work something out with them... Thank you for being here, though. It might have gone less... pleasantly if you hadn't shown up.
48686 := Is there something else you want?
48687 := That's not good enough, Suvam. We know you have more... and we want it now!
48688 := What? You can't just rewrite our agreement whenever you feel like it! The Exchange won't stand for it!
48689 := The Exchange is in no position to dictate orders anymore, Suvam...
48690 := Who's that?
48691 := A stranger... You haven't been telling us everything, now have you, Suvam?
48692 := Tell you everything? What are you talking about? I don't have to clear everything through you!
48693 := The Exchange has no power over us, human! Our business is with Suvam alone.
48694 := A friend, Suvam? You try to hire others to reneg on our deal?
48695 := Our deal? You're the ones trying to break our deal!
48696 := You know what we want, Suvam. Give it to us or next time we'll take it by force.
48697 := Think on this before inviting any more of your 'friends'.
48698 := The Trandoshans, they can be... impulsive sometimes. They mean well, though, really they do. The new ones have just been getting greedy is all...
48699 := Still, at least I ended up in one piece, right?
48700 := Here, I'll let you look at some of the stuff I was saving for them. I'm definitely not going to give this to them now!
48701 := I don't think so, human.
48702 := Or what? You'll force us?
48703 := No! No! Don't fight in here! You'll destroy everything!
48704 := Your threats don't scare us, human!
48705 := We'll be back, Suvam!
48706 := Thank you for helping, but... I really don't think you should have provoked them like that. They can be... impulsive, sometimes.
48707 := Still, at least I ended up all in one piece, right?
48708 := You seek to mock us, human?
48709 := No! No! Don't fight in here! You'll destroy everything!
48710 := We'll be back for you, human... and you as well Suvam.
48711 := Thank you for trying to help, but I don't think this ended very well at all. They can be... impulsive sometimes. They may be back in force...
48712 := [Success] We... leave... now.
48713 := But we have not forgotten you, Suvam!
48714 := They're trying to extort me, that's what! They think that just cause the Exchange is gone, they can take whatever they want from me!
48715 := We are... renegotiating our contract, Suvam.
48716 := I was wondering when you'd want to talk again. What brings you here this time?
48717 := Eh? Hm.. Well, suit yourself. I'll probably be here if you get back... Ha!
48718 := Yeah I know... Some damn smugglers must have brought them and one escaped. Good luck trying to get them all, though. Those things breed like... like gizka!
48719 := If you see any around, just squish the damn thing!
48720 := Sure, it'll be 100 credits.
48721 := [Success] Damn, I don't really need the money anyway. Here, take it.
48722 := Now I'll show you how to play.
48723 := Pazaak? The card game? Actually I do.
48724 := One of the aqualish smugglers who comes by here regularly likes to play a bunch, and I kind of picked up the habit from him.
48725 := I've actually gotten pretty good at it myself. I'll play you a couple rounds if you want. Be warned, though, I don't play for small amounts.
48726 := Eh? Well, suit yourself. Anything else you want?
48727 := Hm... well I have a couple extras. I could sell you one for 100 credits. You want it?
48728 := Thanks. Here's your deck. Now I'll show you how to play.
48729 := Right. This is going to be fun.
48730 := Sure, if you want. I don't play for small amounts, though, so if you want to play, it's for keeps.
48731 := Sure, if you want. You've already proven that I'm no match for you, but if you want a few free games just to play...
48732 := Eh? Sure, then. Some other time.
48733 := Is there anything else you'd like right now?
48734 := Here, have a look.
48735 := Yeah, I have a few things kicking around the place. Stuff the Trandoshans and smugglers have brought for me to look at, and a few things I've been making from parts.
48736 := They aren't cheap, though. They pay a lot for what I can make, and anything I sell to you I can't exactly sell to them, now can I?
48737 := But if you're willing to pay, I've got a few of my more advanced things you can look at. I'm always working on more, so you can check back some other time if I don't have what you want right now.
48738 := Eh? Well, what do you want to know?
48739 := Eh? Sure, sure.
48740 := He used to come here every once in a while to trade. He worked for the Exchange... big-time smugglers. The Trandoshans didn't really want to get on his bad side, so they let it go.
48741 := But now that he's gone, things are a bit more... uncertain.
48742 := Eh? Never heard of them, or it. There were plenty of artifacts on Yavin IV, but no Forges or whatever.
48743 := If that's all you're interested in, you'll probably want to try another system.
48744 := Me? I'm nobody... doing nothing...
48745 := I've been in this system for over 50 years, before this station was even built.
48746 := I just sit around all day and tinker with this and that, trying out a few of my ideas.
48747 := Maybe a little. I just tinker with stuff I've found lying around the ruins on Yavin IV, or that the Trandoshans and smugglers bring me. Of course, with them it's usually weapons and things...
48748 := But I just have so many ideas that people haven't seemed to come up with yet. It's really quite astonishing.
48749 := Oh, all kinds. Weapons, armor, implants, computers. My interests are as varied as the fields they apply to... which is just about everything, heh.
48750 := I've scavenged what I could from the ruins on Yavin IV and I've been tinkering with it for a while.
48751 := Eh? Well, there's the old ruins from Exar Kun's war on that moon. But I've been here over 50 years and I can tell you it's been picked pretty clean by now. If I haven't found it, it's not there. All that's left is rubble.
48752 := Some. Some things I'm still tinkering with, trying to get them working. Mostly I modify some of the things the Trandoshans and smugglers bring me and make them work better.
48753 := Well this gas giant here is Yavin, and it's got a whole bunch of moons around it. The only really interesting one is Yavin IV, though, and it's been pretty much picked clean.
48754 := When Exar Kun started the Great Sith War 50 years ago, he used Yavin IV as a base, building a lot of his Sith temples there.
48755 := When he lost, the Republic came and bombed the surface of the planet, destroying pretty much everything.
48756 := Not much to tell. The Sith Lord Exar Kun tried to take on the galaxy. He lost, of course. They always seem to.
48757 := Exar Kun was a Jedi... to start at least. He came here to Yavin and landed on the fourth moon... the one you can see through the window.
48758 := There were some ancient Sith temples there, and in them Exar Kun gained terrible powers. He raised the Sith and waged a war against the Republic... much like what seems to be happening today.
48759 := But Exar Kun was far more powerful than any Sith Lord who has come since. The very ground trembled beneath his feet and when he looked at you, you just... just...
48760 := But that's all in the past now. I've got my life of staying here and tinkering with the stuff I've found in the ruins and the things the Trandoshans bring me.
48761 := Well... you could still find a few things here and there on the surface. Some buried from the bombardment, some that look much, much older.
48762 := I've been there a bunch of times and found pretty much all there was to find. I took them back here and tinkered with them a bit, getting them up and working, or improving them.
48763 := I have a bunch you can look at if you're interested. Maybe... purchase?
48764 := [Failure] Sure, I can just... What? No, no, I can't do that. You trying to trick me or something?
48765 := Don't try stuff like that around here, kid. It won't work.
48766 := Eh? Suit yourself. Anything else you want then?
48767 := Hm... you don't look like I thought you would. Too... human.
48768 := Don't see many of your kind out here at all anymore... not since the war at any rate. What brings you here?
48769 := Eh? No need to be rude. I was just trying to be friendly is all... You don't have to bite my head off.
48770 := If you don't want to talk, then I don't really know what you're doing here. There's nothing really here in this end of space anymore.
48771 := Eh? What? Don't tell me you youngsters don't know anything about Exar Kun and that war...
48772 := But then again, there've been a lot of... mm... troubles recently I've heard.
48773 := Only what the smugglers and Trandoshans have told me. A new Sith Lord has risen up to replace the dead one, and he's beatng the Republic up pretty bad.
48774 := They didn't seem too displeased with that prospect.
48775 := Exar Kun was a Jedi... to start at least. He came here to Yavin and landed on the fourth moon... the one you can see through the window.
48776 := There were some ancient Sith temples there, and in them Exar Kun gained terrible powers. He raised the Sith and waged a war against the Republic... much like what seems to be happening today.
48777 := But Exar Kun was far more powerful than any Sith Lord who has come since. The very ground trembled beneath his feet and when he looked at you, you just... just...
48778 := But that's all in the past now. I've got my life of staying here and tinkering with the stuff I've found in the ruins and the things the Trandoshans and smugglers bring me.
48779 := Mm... 'Star Forge'? Never heard of it. There's nothing in this system except ruins of Exar Kun's war...
48780 := Yavin's fourth moon used to hold a great number of temples dedicated to the ancient Sith. When Exar Kun came here 50 years ago, he used the temples in his effort to crush the Republic.
48781 := He failed, obviously, and the Republic bombarded the surface almost into oblivion during their counterattack. Now all that's left are a lot of craters and a little bit of jungle.
48782 := You could find stuff there for years afterwards, but I've got pretty much everything there was to find there.
48783 := Mostly all I've been doing for the last couple years has been tinkering with what I've found there, getting some of it to work, and modifying the stuff the smugglers and Trandoshans bring me to look at.
48784 := Darth Malak? Never heard of him... Or is he that new Sith Lord who's giving the Republic such a hard time now? I haven't been keeping up on recent news.
48785 := Well, you see, I'm kind of out of touch with the rest of the galaxy. I haven't left this system in almost 50 years, and this station in the last five, so...
48786 := Hey! It's not a bad way to live! I have all the gadgets I need to tinker with and the smugglers and Trandoshans bring me food and interesting pieces of equipment!
48787 := This station is an old Republic supply depot from when they were fighting Exar Kun. Once they destroyed Yavin IV's surface, though, they didn't need it anymore.
48788 := Once they'd gone, I decided to move in and use the place myself. It's not very roomy, but I think it's turned out all right. And it's close to Yavin IV, where I got most of my parts.
48789 := Nobody comes here except the smugglers and Trandoshans anyway, so I get left alone the way I like it.
48790 := Well... not exactly. See, I'm not as young as I look. Actually, I'm pretty old by most standards. I've been here since the war, really.
48791 := The Sith were building a whole lot of temples on Yavin IV by Exar Kun's order, and they needed people to build it for them... so they got slaves.
48792 := Most of the slaves were put to work on the buildings directly, but there are a lot of other things you need to make a planet a working base. Weapons, for instance.
48793 := So they forced some Baragwin to work for them making weapons. You know Baragwin, right?
48794 := And I was one of the ones working under the Baragwin. I guess you could say I had the talent for it. The Baragwin I worked for, he took me under his wing and made me his apprentice, even...
48795 := But almost all of them died when the Republic destroyed the place, so I guess it's useless to think about it.
48796 := Well, yeah, kind of. More like forced labor, really. We worked, or we died. Life gets really simple when someone puts it to you like that.
48797 := We didn't have it near as bad as the ones who were actually building the temples themselves, though. I wouldn't be surprised if not a single one saw the temples completed.
48798 := You don't know who the Baragwin are? They're the best damn weapons merchants in the galaxy, that's who they are!
48799 := They were in space selling arms to the highest bidder before my species even got off our homeworld.
48800 := Their weapons are the highest quality you can find, too. Better than either the Republic OR the Sith.
48801 := I might have a couple. You want to take a look?
48802 := Eh? Suit yourself, then.
48803 := Eh? Yes, of course! You don't see anyone else around, do you?
48804 := Well, not entirely alone at any rate... Trandoshans or smugglers come by every so often and drop things off and pick some of my inventions up.
48805 := Maybe a little. I just tinker with stuff I've found lying around the ruins on Yavin IV, or that the Trandoshans and smugglers bring me. Of course, with them it's usually weapons and things...
48806 := But I just have so many ideas that people haven't seemed to come up with yet. It's really quite astonishing.
48807 := Rodians, aqualish, Twi'leks, whatever... They all work an organization called the Exchange. You might have heard of them.
48808 := They run smuggling operations all over the galaxy. Weapons, slaves, whatever someone's willing to pay the price for.
48809 := They found my talents very useful.
48810 := Like the Trandoshans, they get me to patch up and upgrade what they bring, and pay me well for it. They also bring news and supplies.
48811 := The Trandoshans? Mercenaries and bounty hunters... Scum, mostly. They look like big two-legged lizards.
48812 := They found me here a couple years after the war ended. Usually they don't bargain with people they find alone in abandoned space stations, but we worked out a deal.
48813 := I'd give them a few of my more... applicable inventions at reasonable prices, and they'd keep me supplied with food and new materials.
48814 := Now all bets are off. I have a few supplies tucked away, but I can't stay here forever. I know they'll be back as well. But that's something to think about another time.
48815 := Now it seems they might be trying for a power grab now that the Exchange is down... I don't know what's going to happen next, but it doesn't look good.
48816 := It's worked out well so far, for years really. With Davik gone, they've been getting ideas, though.
48817 := Anything else you want to know?
48818 := No! Nothing like Rodians! Trandoshans are ugly, disgusting creatures... but you'd never want to say that to their faces. Rip your head clean off, probably.
48819 := Eh? Oh that... That always seems to happen to the Republic. They always seem right on the verge of defeat and then manage to spring back. I shouldn't worry so much.
48820 := And even if they do lose... so what? It's not like it's going to affect me way out here. The ruins on Yavin IV are gone and nothing's left of Exar Kun, so the Sith have nothing to bring them here.
48821 := Ah... of course you are. Far be it for me to doubt you. But why here? It's the middle of nowhere... Unless you're here for the ruins on Yavin IV?
48822 := Of course, of course, and I can see that you're starting to get all worked up about the whole thing, so I'll just leave it well enough alone.
48823 := But why are you way out here? It's the middle of nowhere. Nothing to interest you here... unless you're looking for the ruins on Yavin IV.
48824 := Former... student? Ah-hah, yes, of course.
48825 := Your business with him is none of my business, of course, and I don't want to pry, but why are you way out here? Running?
48826 := Acquired, eh? Well figures Davik would be lazy enough to leave it in the nav computer...
48827 := Didn't leave anything about this system, did he? Ancient ruins or anything?
48828 := Eh? No, no, of course not. A big woman like you? No, no. But why are you here in the middle of nowhere? The ruins?
48829 := Eh? No, no, of course not. A big man like you? No, no. But why are you here in the middle of nowhere? The ruins?
48830 := A new Dark Lord, is he? It always seems a new one pops up, no matter how many you kill...
48831 := The Jedi Council? Don't tell me you're a Jedi... you sure don't look it!
48832 := Only hope, eh? That's a lot of pressure to put on someone. I hope for their sake it's not misplaced.
48833 := So if you don't mind saying, what exactly is the Council sending you out to do?
48834 := Now far be it for me to say that you aren't, but I'm going to be a skeptic and say that the one with the armada and the troops is more likely to be the true Dark Lord.
48835 := Not that I doubt you, you understand, I'm just trying to keep an open mind.
48836 := And whether you are or not, my past is behind me, so I've nothing against you either way.
48837 := Now, now, I never said I doubted you, it's just... well, there aren't exactly a lot of Jedi wandering around these parts, not after what happened last time.
48838 := Eh? Eh?! Who is that? What do you want? I recognize your ship... Davik's, isn't it?
48839 := But who are you? You new or something?
48840 := [Success] Yes... I'll open the door for you, friend.
48841 := You don't sound like a Trandoshan, and you're not one of Davik's... Who are you? What do you want?
48842 := [Failure] Yes, now I do recog... no... wait. What the... ?
48843 := I thought you might be, but no. Davik's gone now, destroyed on Taris. His people are all gone, too. So who are you?
48844 := [Failure] Ha! Davik went down with Taris when the Sith destroyed it. That much I've learned from the local Exchange. So who are you?
48845 := My first legitimate visitor in 20 years and she turns out to be a Sith-wannabe joker... just my luck.
48846 := My first legitimate visitor in 20 years and he turns out to be a Sith-wannabe joker... just my luck.
48847 := Well, I suppose even that's better than some more Trandoshans... They aren't exactly known for their stunning conversation.
48848 := Yeah, yeah, don't get antsy, I'll get there. Just have to fiddle with this damn door lock... thing keeps jamming...
48849 := There we go.
48850 := All my business with the Sith is old news and I intend to leave it there. I don't need some young upstart bringing that stuff up again, so just drop it.
48851 := Eh, I can't leave leave you standing out there talking, though... you seem to do a lot of that. I guess you can come in if you'll be civil.
48852 := Just have to fiddle with this damn door lock... thing keeps jamming...
48853 := They come by here every once in a while, it's how I keep in the loop, you know. But Trandoshan lizard-speak is kind of hard to follow and they have pretty limited imaginations...
48854 := Smugglers aren't much better either...
48855 := Look, this is getting kind of awkward through this door, if you'll just hold on a minute, I'll open this damn thing up and we can talk more face to face.
48856 := Eh? Sith? They haven't been here in 50 years... not since the last war. Don't see why they'd start making a habit of it now...
48857 := Still, all my business with the Sith is old news. Politics ain't my affair, so as long as you don't get all worked up, I guess I can let you in.
48858 := Republic, eh? The Republic hasn't been here in 50 years... don't see why they'd start now.
48859 := Still, I have nothing against the Republic, so as long as you don't get all worked up, I guess I can let you in.
48860 := It would be nice to have someone to talk to for a change... Trandoshans and smugglers aren't exactly stunning conversationalists.
48861 := Hah! I still got it!
48862 := But don't feel bad, kid, it happens all the time. Heh.
48863 := Interested in another game?
48864 := Hm... you're good, I have to admit that.
48865 := But I still think I can beat you a couple more times. You interested?
48866 := I can't keep up with a player like you. You're just too good.
48867 := But I respect that. Tell you what, I'll give you a discount on anything in my store 'cause of that. Special deal just for you.
48868 := That was a good practice game. Interested in another?
48869 := [Force Persuade] Leave. Now.
48870 := I'll... uh... just be going now.
48871 := Haven't I told you guys to get lost already?
48872 := Get away from Suvam!
48873 := What do you want?
48874 := [Force Persuade] I'll take your inventions off your hands.
48875 := [Persuade] I'll look after your inventions for you.
48876 := Is there anything I can do to help?
48877 := Good riddance!
48878 := [Force Persuade] You want to give me all your inventions.
48879 := [Force Persuade] You can cut me a deal.
48880 := I'm not interested in that right now.
48881 := Let's see what you have.
48882 := What are you going to do?
48883 := Where will you go?
48884 := What did those Trandoshans want?
48885 := I represent the Exchange.
48886 := Leave. I'm not going to tell you a second time.
48887 := I'm just going to be leaving now.
48888 := If you're going to blast him, at least cut me in on something.
48889 := I think you guys better leave.
48890 := That's it. Now you die!
48891 := Dead or alive, you're leaving.
48892 := Or I will ask you again. Very politely.
48893 := [Force Persuade] Leave. Now.
48894 := What's going on here, Suvam?
48895 := I'll be leaving now.
48896 := I think you have gizka loose...
48897 := Can I buy a Pazaak deck off you?
48898 := [Force Persuade] Give me the deck.
48899 := You don't happen to play Pazaak do you?
48900 := Not right now.
48901 := I don't have a deck.
48902 := Here you go.
48903 := Sure, let's play.
48904 := Interested in a hand of Pazaak?
48905 := Some other time.
48906 := Let's play.
48907 := Do you have anything you'd be willing to sell me?
48908 := I'd like to ask you a few questions.
48909 := I'm not really interested in more questions right now.
48910 := How did you know Davik?
48911 := Do you know anything about ancient Star Maps or the 'Star Forge'?
48912 := Who are the Trandoshans?
48913 := Tell me about yourself.
48914 := Do you have any gadgets you'd be willing to sell me?
48915 := You're an inventor?
48916 := What kinds of things do you work on?
48917 := There's stuff on Yavin IV?
48918 := Have you found anything useful?
48919 := Why did you come here?
48920 := Tell me about this system.
48921 := Why are you here?
48922 := What about this station?
48923 := What was on Yavin IV?
48924 := Tell me about the Great Sith War.
48925 := Tell me about Exar Kun.
48926 := So what's with you and Yavin IV?
48927 := 'Pretty much' everything?
48928 := [Force Persuade] Give them to me.
48929 := Not right now.
48930 := Sure, what do you have?
48931 := None of your business, bug-eyes!
48932 := Anymore?
48933 := What have you heard about the current war?
48934 := Enlighten me about Exar Kun.
48935 := I seek the pieces of a map to a 'Star Forge'.
48936 := What are you doing here, then?
48937 := What ruins?
48938 := Exar Kun?
48939 := I'm trying to defeat Darth Malak.
48940 := Why don't you know these things?
48941 := Why did you come here to the station?
48942 := So you're from this system?
48943 := Did you get brought here?
48944 := Were you in the war?
48945 := You were a slave?
48946 := Who are the Baragwin?
48947 := Do you have any Baragwin equipment?
48948 := Not right now.
48949 := Sure.
48950 := You spend all your time here in this station? Alone?
48951 := You're an inventor?
48952 := Who are the smugglers?
48953 := Who are the Trandoshans?
48954 := I'd like to ask you something else.
48955 := What do they want with you?
48956 := Why are they here?
48957 := Oh. Sort of like Rodians.
48958 := He is beating the Republic pretty badly.
48959 := I'M the one who will defeat the Republic!
48960 := Exar Kun?
48961 := What ruins?
48962 := It matters to me!
48963 := He is my former student.
48964 := When I... acquired the Ebon Hawk, it had the coordinates for your station.
48965 := I am NOT running!
48966 := He is the Dark Lord of the Sith.
48967 := I'm on a quest for the Jedi Council.
48968 := I am their only hope.
48969 := They have sent me to stop Darth Malak.
48970 := I am the true Dark Lord of the Sith!
48971 := I AM a Jedi!
48972 := What happened before?
48973 := Open this door or I'll blow my way in!
48974 := [Force Persuade] Open this door. I am your friend.
48975 := I don't know what you're talking about.
48976 := Yeah, I'm new. Very new.
48977 := [Force Persuade] I do work for Davik.
48978 := [Lie] I do work for Davik.
48979 := I am the Dark Lord and I am very displeased with you.
48980 := I don't have time to stick around in this airlock... Let me in!
48981 := What are you doing here?
48982 := You have a problem with the Sith?
48983 := Trandoshans and smugglers? What are you talking about?
48984 := I'm trying to save the galaxy from the Sith.
48985 := I work for the Republic.

  In regards to the system in place to cycle water from the ocean to the thermal heaters:
  What were you thinking?!? What made you put that airlock mechanism on the only other path to the north side of the base?? Now everyone has to know how to cycle the water out of one room and into the adjoining one for each of the three rooms in sequence without accidentally flooding the room they're in. We lost seven troopers just this week!
  Next time I'm there you better show me how to do it properly! I can't afford to lose any more of my aides while trying to get to the Selkath!

Adjutant:
  Sorry, sir, but we had to change the pump mechanism since one of those fish people swam into one of the intakes outside.
  The external flow controls push the water into the chambers north and south only now. The flow controls on the inside wall switches the water between sides east and west.
  The trick now is to push the water to the north and south extremes, then switch the water east-west and walk through. The meters by the flow control panels show if there is water in the adjacent room. We've also installed lifeform detection sensors, so there shouldn't be anymore aide problems...
  We're trying to get the system passed as quickly as possible, sir, but the Selkath authorities monitoring our base have made this much more difficult.

49246 := A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

The Republic verges on collapse.  Darth Malak, last surviving apprentice of the Dark Lord Darth Revan has unleashed an invincible Sith armada on an unsuspecting galaxy.

Easily crushing all resistance, Darth Malak's war of ruthless conquest has left the Jedi Order scattered and vulnerable as countless Knights fall in battle, and many more swear allegiance to the new Sith Master.

In the skies above the Outer Rim world of Taris a Jedi battle fleet engages the forces of Darth Malak in a last, desperate attempt to halt the advance of the Sith invaders...

Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Used in lightsaber construction, rubat crystal is mined on Phemis. It produces a clearly defined blade that a Jedi can easily focus on. 
49250 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Found on the desert world of Daminia, this crystal can be used in lightsaber construction to produce a clearly defined beam of subtly wider width and length. 
49251 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Once mined on the third moon of Erai, ancient Sith bombardment shattered much that remained. If they can be found, these crystals produce a clear, superior lightsaber beam. 
49252 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

This crystallized material was excreted once every 11 years by the ancient Volice worm of Lwhekk, now extinct. It produces a more intense lightsaber beam, granting better control. 
49253 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

This crystal is mined in the mountains of planet M'haeli, and when used in lightsaber construction it produces a volatile blade that can cause surprising amounts of damage. 
49254 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Found in the asteroid fields of the Fyrth system, this crystal can be used in lightsaber construction to produce an intense beam that seems extraordinarily quick to the cut. 
49255 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

The refined form of Opila, this crystal has been cleansed of all impurities. When used in lightsaber construction it produces a blade of unerring quickness. 
49256 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
 
The strange byproduct of rare impurities bonding during the making of certain alloys and some random external condition, this crystal produces a fiercely burning lightsaber beam. 
49257 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Ambria was a world in the grip of the dark side. Through years of mental battle, strange Jedi Master Thon contained the evil to Lake Natth. Long meditation can form this powerful crystal from the tainted water. 
49258 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

This heavy crystal is collected by the natives of Rafa V. If used in lightsaber construction it produces an electrically charged beam that is much easier to manipulate than standard beams. 
49259 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

This crystal was mined on a far-orbit asteroid circling the Alderaan system. It produces a volatile lightsaber beam that pulses on impact, discharging part of its energy into an opponent. 
49260 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Mined in the Sigil System, this crystal is a costly but valued addition to a lightsaber. It produces a fiercely bright beam that sears on contact, inflicting great damage. 
49261 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Strangely, this crystal is usually encountered scattered in the orbit of primarily forest worlds. It is brittle but versatile, and a Master Jedi can get it to produce many effects. 
49262 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Taken from the gullet of a krayt dragon, this crystalline "pearl" appears to have refractory qualities that might allow it to function as a lightsaber crystal once properly adapted. 
49263 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

There are many famous lightsaber crystals spoken of in the history of the Jedi Order, though few are as powerful as the legendary Solari Crystal. An artifact of true light side power, only those Jedi who are pure in spirit can wield a lightsaber equipped with this gleaming white gem.
When the great Jedi Master Ood Bnar initiated his life-cycle change after a thousand years of serving the Order, he bequeathed the Solari Crystal to his most promising student, a young female Jedi named Shaela Nuur. When Shaela disappeared shortly after the time of the Great Hunt, the Solari Crystal vanished with her. 
49264 := Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber

Although as jewelry it is merely decorative, the crystal in this Wookiee hunting clan amulet looks similar to those used in lightsaber construction and may have interesting properties.
