How did you get down here?
I wish I could help you with that.
I am confident that you can deal with that on your own.
How can I help?
Then I suggest we move on.
Yes, I promised you an answer when we reached the Ebon Hawk, didn't I? But I'm afraid you won't like it. We should have some privacy for this.
I've given it considerable thought. I tried to master my emotions, rule out anything that would upset the careful balance I've spent years of training developing... but it's no use.
You're stronger than I am, and there's no point in telling me otherwise. You will be a great Jedi, I think. I hope.
I can't deny that there are parts of you I am drawn to. Your power, your will. You are so much stronger than I am.
In some ways you make me feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. But at the same time, you make me feel stronger, more alive.
Your guess is as good as mine. I know I'm not going to stop fighting against Malak and against the dark side.
I don't know. I have no experience in this sort of thing... and, really, this isn't the sort of time for... anything to happen, is it?
I realize now these feelings are part of the bond we share. The Jedi Council surely realized this; they knew my loyalty to the doctrines of our Order would be tested on this mission.
By facing and overcoming my feelings for you I have learned a valuable lesson about control and the dangers of emotion. This is an important step in understanding the Force.
I'm sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear. But I felt it was important you know our... infatuation... was nothing more than a result of our powerful bond.
Please, don't say it like that. You make it sound like I was using you! Don't you realize how difficult this was for me?
I... suppose you're right. If.. if all this fails because of me, I just... I don't think I could bear it.
Let's get on with this. I want to find Malak... I want this to end as soon as possible. Whatever lies between us we can... we can work out then.
Good. If... if we didn't stop Malak, and it was my fault... I don't think I could bear it.
You have been patient with me, haven't you? I suppose you deserve an answer. But you have to understand how difficult this is for me to say.
*sigh*... it's just...
It's just... this is wrong! I am supposed to *know* better!
With all my training, I should be able to control myself better than this. But you're not anything like I expected. You're not like any man I've ever met before.
I find myself watching you when I don't mean to. I'm thinking about you when I don't want to. It isn't supposed to be like this!
Well you're going to. I cannot keep this to myself any longer, no matter how unpleasant you might find it.
I don't know. It shouldn't be so hard to not think of you. It should be easy to not think of you. I should have discipline! Jedi discipline!
Every time I try to call on all my teachings to calm myself, they fail me. You have such power, such passion! I don't know if it's due to the bond between us, but I'm drawn to you.
You... good. That is good. That... makes it easier for me. I would prefer to think of you as a disgusting, horrid man than... anything else.
It would be better if I could leave, return to Dantooine or... go anywhere other than here and put this behind me. But I can't. Malak must be stopped.
Don't worry - I can put this behind me. Let's just continue on with what we must do. It is better this way.
Oh, I thought... No, this is good. I'm glad you told me. This makes everything much easier.
I... *laugh*! No! Damn you for making me laugh! This... this is serious!
The Force is a part of you, as is your power. But that's not what attracted me to you. It's more than that. Maybe it's the bond we share. It gives us a certain... intimacy.
If I could, I would return to Dantooine. I need to be away from this bond of ours. I need to weaken it. I need to be anywhere but near you!
But I can't. Malak must be stopped, no matter what.
That... that's good. That makes this easier. I still feel a fool for acting like this, but knowing there is nothing...
And go where? I am needed here, just as you are. There is nothing that is more important than what we are doing. Which is why we need to resolve this.
I wonder... if this is a result of our bond? Or pehaps this was meant to be? I just know that I can't control what I'm feeling.
Please, don't tell anyone. I can... try to work through this, if I must. I just... I need to know if you feel anything. For me.
I... see. I don't know how to feel about that.
In a way, I feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. I also feel stronger, more alive... I've never felt anything like it.
I shall have to think on this. I am... sorry for bringing this all up so suddenly. This is not exactly the best of times for such talk, is it?
But, then, if all this had never happened... never mind. Let us continue doing what we came here for.
Good. We have more than enough to occupy ourselves, I am sure.
Yes, I did end that quite abruptly, didn't I? Perhaps a Master could have addressed my questions with the proper wisdom. But I never should have brought it up here. Not with you.
I don't think I'm the proper Jedi to guide you. I am no Master. You should have remained with the Council.
Please don't make light of this. The very fact that I am plagued by this doubt is yet further evidence of my inadequacy.
Perhaps you are not being truly objective, then. There is no need to spare my feelings on this point.
The fact of the matter is that I have never possessed much skill at controlling myself. With the bond that joins us, it seems I have even less.
If it were not for my Battle Meditation, I would still be in training... and we, no doubt, would not even have met.
You have maintained the path of the light side. But it has been in spite of my influence, not because of it. It is increasingly obvious I am unable to guide you properly.
Fair enough. You will probably be better off on your own, in any case. I won't trouble you with this anymore.
I will attend to my own issues, and you... you are on your own.
That is kind of you to say, but I think the evidence speaks for itself. I think... I think I may have made a very big mistake.
I don't know. I think... I think I may have made a very big mistake.
I simply hope that you are not the one who pays the price, ultimately, for the fact that I can't help you enough.
That's a kinder response than I deserve. And I can see there is wisdom in your words.
Perhaps you can help me. And I will try to help you, if I can. Hopefully this will all work out, for the both of us. And for the sake of the mission.
You... you continue to be there for me, don't you? Even after I keep pushing you away, you're still around when I need you most.
Well, just... different, I suppose. Things are not going as I thought they would. I... I need time to think about all this.
And that's probably for the best, isn't it? Unfortunately we must continue this mission whether we like it or not.
Whether you will continue on your current path and fall to the dark side, I don't know. But it is increasingly obvious I am unable to guide you properly.
Am I so transparent? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, considering our bond. Yes, there is something I would like to ask, if you'll permit it.
In our time together I've been watching you. You are a true servant of the light, you follow the tenets of the Jedi Order despite the lure of the dark side. And with so little training.
For me it has always been a constant battle. Don't you find it difficult at all? You make it seem so easy. Or is that only an illusion?
You don't? Sometimes I find that it is nearly all I can think of. I have never found the Jedi training easy to master.
I've always struggled for control over my passions. I've always been too quick to anger, too quick to get involved. My instructors constantly berated me for it.
I've often dreamed that I might be able to confront Darth Malak myself. I dream I can use all this power I have to kill him and stop all the death and destruction.
I just think about all the evil that the Sith have caused and I... I get so furious. Yet we are told that these feelings are the path to the dark side.
I suppose I do. Part of me thinks that it would be worth anything to vanquish evil, even if it meant giving in to my base emotions.
The very thought that I could become as evil as Malak; I just can't fathom it. It just doesn't seem possible. How could I... no, wait. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't even be asking you this. The Jedi teachings are clear; who am I to question them? And even worse, who am I to try and make you question them?
These are dangerous thoughts, the indulgence of a vain mind. Please, forget I ever mentioned this. Let's just return to our mission.
But what comes next? After using all that power, would you decide to impose your own view on the universe? The dark side corrupts your very thoughts.
I don't know. Would the power I used to kill Darth Malak be too tempting to keep using? Would I become the kind of evil I want to destroy?
That's a relief to hear. I have never found the Jedi path an easy one to walk, and it's good to know I'm not alone.
And that's enough for you? If only it were as easy for me. If only the right path was always clear.
In our time together I've been watching you. I've seen your tendency towards giving in to your darker emotions. You do as you please, for the most part.
Don't worry, this isn't a lead-up to a lecture. I'm... fascinated by your passion, by how easily it comes to you.
You seem to do whatever you want, something I would never dare consider. Don't you fear the consequences?
That... that's a relief to hear. That you would even be willing to risk so much is... is very brave. Braver than I could be.
Is it? The thought of what could happen to me if I lose control... somehow I think life could be very long, indeed.
I doubt my old Master would approve of your advice. Besides, I'm not like you. I must always be on guard against such outbursts.
Don't even start with that. You're the one who asked. I wasn't even going to say anything. But now that you've brought it up, I see I shouldn't have waited as long as I have.
I do. I have been trying to come up with the best way to say this for some time, but I suppose I should just come out and say it.
The truth is, I have come to depend on you. Not just for the sake of the mission, but for my own sake as well. I am... I am glad you are with us.
Did I? I am trying to be sincere, here. It occurred to me that I may have been too critical of you. Too demanding, at times.
I know my manner can be a bit taciturn. I know you must be getting sick of my lectures about the dark side and... and everything else.
I spent all my years being hounded by my instructors. Being told so often how gifted and important I was until I was sick of it.
I remember when I was younger I used to swear that I would never become as self-absorbed and stodgy as the Jedi Masters. It's ironic, really.
Yes, well... there's no need for you to agree so whole-heartedly.
Being controlled has kept everyone around me at an arm's length; even those like yourself who are most in need of my understanding and compassion.
But maybe it's time to change that. You deserve to know how much I respect and admire you. I thought... I just thought I should tell you.
Well, that was not nearly so difficult as I feared. Thank you for hearing me out. I feel... I feel much better.
I suppose not. But I am becoming like that, though it's not easy for me to admit.
That's kind of you to say, but I know for myself that it's not really true.
I see. Is there nothing I can do to make it up to you? I would rather we were friends.
I... you know I can't feel that way about you. About any man. It isn't permitted. I am a Jedi, I must resist these temptations.
But I still want to consider you a friend. We could... we could never be anything more, though. That... that isn't allowed.
What? But I... alright. Have it your way, if that's what you'd prefer. We needn't talk further.
I am trying my best. You are not making this easy for me, you know.
Now you're teasing me. You know very well what I said.
Well, yes. Surely that is not so surprising.
No, I'm not. Why must you make this so difficult for me? Can't you just accept a simple compliment?
Why? I could not accomplish this on my own, I need the aid of others - especially one who is strong in the Force. The bond between us made you a natural choice.
I admit, there were times that I wondered if this is more than just a mission to stop Malak. There were times when I wondered if this was also a way for the Council to test my own abilities.
You must learn to trust in the wisdom of the Council. Your destiny will come in its appointed time. You mustn't be so impatient.
Only a question? Meaning I should ignore the subtle accusations in your questions?
*Must* you be so frustrating? I admit, I had a moment of foolish pride. But I'm over it. Now I am focused on my true responsibilities.
I am simply trying to help you and complete this mission, and yet you battle me at every turn!
I started it? You were the one who brought up the issue of the Council! You were the one who questioned our mission! You're the one who mocked me for thinking I was being tested!
Perhaps the Council is relying a lot on our bond and my visions. Perhaps they are desperate. Does that make you feel better, knowing that?
Fun?! Fun?! Driving me insane is your idea of a good time?
I must admit: I simply don't know how to deal with someone like you.
You... you are a very odd man, do you know that? I simply don't know how to deal with you. All I want to do is help you, but you seem determined to drive me mad.
Oh, if only it were that easy...
I don't know if I should be outraged that you keep joking about serious matters, or if I should be grateful that you can always lighten the mood.
Unfortunately it isn't as easy as that. But your point is well taken.
Come on, come, let's move on... there's much to be done.
I do. I've been watching you. Studying you closely to see what kind of progress you have made since your training at the hands of Master Zhar.
I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occasions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.
Regardless, it is not too late for that to change. You must continue to work on your control, lest the dark side overwhelm you.
You need to see what the dark side represents in its entirety, for it is what we battle. Only the wisdom of a Jedi Master can truly explain this, but I will do my best to make you understand.
The dark side is not simply giving in to anger or temptation to use the Force to destructive ends. These things only lead to the dark side.
The dark side grows stronger and more insidious the closer you draw to it. It begs you to surrender to it, to release all its terrible power... and it becomes harder and harder to resist.
And once you stop resisting, it is too late. It twists you up inside and... and turns you into a mockery of everything you once stood for.
You say you understand, but I'm afraid you are taking this too lightly. The power of the dark side can be... alluring.
We need only to look at the atrocities which have been committed by those under its sway to understand the terrible, corrupting evil of the dark side.
Millions dead, and far more suffering. What sort of person would you have to become to perform such deeds gladly?
And that is why the dark side is so insidious. If you are not careful, you do not even see each small step you take towards it until it is too late.
It is so easy to think that we would never fall prey to such a horror; that we have unlimited control, vigilance and foresight. If only that were true.
The Sith have become powerful because there are many Jedi who have succumbed to the lure of the dark side and joined their cause.
What greater weapon is there than to turn an enemy to your cause? To use their own knowledge against them?
We are weakened while they are strengthened. So we must harden our hearts and do whatever is required to fight against the dark side. Even when the battle becomes wearying.
No, I suppose not. I have spoken more than enough of the dark side. It is up to you whether you heed my words or not.
I don't know. The vision of our future is clouded by shadows cast from the dark side. But I sense something ominous lurking in those shadows.
But words alone cannot save one from the dark side. Come, we should continue with the task at hand. When the time comes I only hope we are all strong enough to do what we must.
And how adept must one become at making excuses for one's actions, if suffering is the result? How long before you stop making excuses at all?
Neither do I, and I hope I never do.
One who serves the light side does not strike down an innocent. We take arms against the dark side and the injustice that follows it only.
I am no less resistant to temptation than any other. I simply have the benefit of training that you do not. But even the training of the Jedi might not be enough to save us.
I know as much as any other Jedi because I face it every day. It is vital that you understand what the dark side represents, for it is what we must battle.
We must, for all our sakes. If you had the proper training under a true Master you would know all this. But because of our mission, I must be the one to try and help you understand.
I've seen how you have resisted many temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable, but I'm afraid you might stray from this path.
Yes, I suppose I can understand your curiosity, given the bond that connects us. Very well, I'll tell you a bit about myself.
Did you not know this? I have gone through most of the training that a regular Jedi would. I have simply not completed the final tests.
The Battle Meditation ability I possess is a rare and powerful one, however... and it was sorely needed enough that my training was interrupted.
I have never lied. Regardless, the fact remains that I have received considerably more training than you.
I was found to be strong with the Force at a young age, as most Padawans are. As a girl I was given to the Order to be trained.
When I joined the Order I left my family on Talravin, as all Padawans do. My family is still there, the last that I heard. I have had little contact with them, as it is discouraged.
Relationships with family members are fraught with powerful emotions. Such extremes are to be avoided. Anger and hate are the worst, but even love can lead to folly.
Like all who join the Order, I have learned to embrace the life I have chosen. I had to let go of my attachments to my family.
It can be a hard lesson to learn. I was not on good terms with all of my family, but I do remember missing my father terribly for a very long time.
You were the one who asked to know more about me! Very well, if you have changed your mind then I suppose we should just get back to our mission.
A child is too young to understand the sacrifices that must be made. It is better if they have no contact with their family once they are removed.
Not all Jedi follow that policy. Some even take husbands or wives and enjoy the love they have. Most often that is not the case.
Once I was older I realized the wisdom of this policy. A Jedi must do what is needed, personal desires notwithstanding. Love can only obscure and confuse the matter.
You do not understand. Some sacrifices are... harder than others.
Even a Jedi cannot always control the feelings of the heart. We must do our best to guard against it, no matter what the cost. But some sacrifices are harder than others.
Some sacrifices are... harder than others.
I... I do not wish to discuss this anymore. I would rather return to our mission.
Very close. I was only a little girl when I left my family, but I still remember him fondly. He was kind and gentle and doted on me. My mother, however, was different.
I was not on good terms with my mother. I was only a little girl when I left, but I was old enough to resent her and the way she treated my father.
She pushed my father into treasure hunting. I spent all my young life on ships traveling from one false lead to the next.
She whittled away my father's entire fortune, and I hated her for it. I think she was relieved to give me to the Jedi, but my father was heartbroken.
The gift of the Force comes with a high cost. Sacrifice of one's emotional attachments is one of the prices a Jedi must be willing to pay. The alternative is to fall prey to the dark side.
Please, you mustn't say things like that. The dark side is destruction and chaos, the opposite of all that gives the universe order and purpose. You have to understand this.
And you need to be more mindful of your responsibilities! Have you any idea of the danger a fallen Jedi represents? Not only to yourself, but to others as well?
Oh, yes, because you know your way so well, do you? Let us speak no more, then, since you are so independent.
That is something every Jedi should be afraid of.
Emotional entanglements can be dangerous. They can impair rational thought, they can lead to outbursts of uncontrolled emotion. A Jedi must be above such things.
Yes, I did. I wanted to speak to you about our mission. About what lies ahead for us. It seems fate, or the Force, is driving us into a confrontation with the Dark Lord.
There is no need to be angry. Some would believe that I have not been cautious enough, considering your natural power and lack of training.
Meaning that it is more important that we work together. You were, after all, accepted by the Jedi Council.
I should not have been so quick to underestimate you. You are neither unskilled nor a novice... you are a talented individual who has proven to be both skilled and resourceful.
I focused exclusively on matters that you have little control over, and that was a mistake. I believe your presence here is important.
As you say. You said you had a question for me?
I... would rather not discuss that, at the moment. Perhaps another time.
No... wait. Forgive me. This is difficult for me, but there is something you have to hear.
You must prepare yourself for when we face Malak. The confrontation will be difficult for you. I remember how hard it was when I first faced Revan.
Such as?
It's true that, due to my Battle Meditation, I was with the Jedi strike team that boarded Revan's ship. We did not kill Revan, however.
Our mission was to capture Revan, if possible. It was Malak who turned on his own master, firing upon Revan's ship while we were still on board it.
It was his desire to kill us and his master both. Thankfully we narrowly escaped the vessel as it exploded.
True, I suppose. And yet the outcome of that battle was... unexpected. To all of us. Revan's end was... unforeseen.
As I said, we were there to capture Revan alive. The Jedi do not believe in killing their prisoners. No one deserves execution, no matter what their crimes.
Remember that Revan and Malak were once great Jedi. Heroes in every sense of the word. They demonstrate the danger of the dark side to us all.
I'm sorry. We really shouldn't speak of this anymore. The memory of my confrontation with Revan is... painful. Let's return to the mission, please.
I have had time to ponder my actions. I am often quick to judge... a fault my master points out frequently.
It was a simple apology, that's all. You said you had a question for me?
I do. How did you know?
You may attempt to be humurous, if you wish, but the matter is a serious one.
I am a Jedi. I am far too disciplined to betray my emotions with outward physical displays. We both know the real reason you have some idea of what I am thinking: the bond we share.
A... a kinrath pup?! It most certainly is not!
I am a Jedi, remember? I have far too much mental discipline to reveal what goes on inside my mind with such obvious physical clues.
I see. I, myself, have little trouble sensing your strength with the Force through our bond.
Why do you still try to deny the existence of this bond between us? Like it or not, we are linked... as our shared vision of the Star Map proved.
Our connection allows us glimpses into each other's mind. We can feel some of what the other feels. And what I feel within you troubles me.
A Padawan must receive considerable training. They must learn to control their emotions and darker impulses. Often it takes years before using the Force can be considered safe.
The fact that you are so strong in the Force and have had such relatively little training could have terrible consequences. For you, and for everyone around you.
I don't think there is much you can do. If things were different I would recommend several years of training under one of the Jedi Masters. But I fear that won't be possible.
Thankfully you have exhibited a degree of compassion and self-control up to this point. I sincerely hope you can maintain these traits in the future.
We must all resist the influence of the dark side! It is everything we are fighting against! This is doubly important for you, with your natural affinity for the Force!
That is good to hear. Without the proper training, however, I'm afraid you will find the path difficult even with the best of intentions. There is great danger ahead, for both of us.
Our destinies are intertwined. Everything one of us does will have consequences for the other. Any reckless behavior on your part is likely to affect me as well.
I believe you truly mean what you say. For now. But sometimes it is not so easy to keep such promises.
Your power could be a gift or a curse. When you need guidance, or advice, or support I will do my best to help you stay on the path of the light.
No, of course not. Not yet. But there will be challenges ahead that might make it otherwise.
Yes, that is true. I will do my best to guide you, but I am no Master. Not yet. And there are times when I find the sheer strength of your power almost overwhelming.
That's not true. I am worried about myself, but also about you. I would rather see neither of us come to any harm.
I am not trying to harass you. But you must understand the trials and perils that lie ahead. For you, and for me.
I'm sorry if I come across as harsh. But I am concerned. For you, for our mission. And for myself, as well.
Already you exhibit the kind of willfullness, erratic behavior and lack of compassion that will lead you to corruption.
No? Self-control is a maxim for all Jedi. It is what gives us the strength to resist the dark side. All who have fallen from our Order have shown a flagrant disregard for such control.
This is not a joke! The choices you make could affect both our destinies, not to mention the fate of the Republic and the entire galaxy! There is much at stake.
No, not bothering me. Not exactly. I've been thinking about what the Jedi Council said about the two of us.
There is a bond between us, I do not dispute that. I can feel it, as I'm sure you can. The nature of that bond and its effect on our mission remain in question.
Our fates are strongly connected; so connected that a literal bond has been forged between us.
I saw your service records when you were transferred aboard the Endar Spire, but nothing beyond that. I know very little about you. I'd like to ask you some questions, given our relationship.
I was referring to the bond we share; the one the Jedi Council spoke of. If I actually was interested in you, rest assured I could come up with a better approach than this!
Your records spoke of your skills only... nothing of you. If we are to share this bond, I would like to know more. Would you... answer some questions?
Just a few questions about your background. Nothing intrusive, I assure you.
Why would you refuse to answer? These are simple questions, nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?
I see. I didn't mean to upset you, but I suppose it was inevitable. You've had a lot to absorb since we escaped Taris. I apologize.
Good. First, what sort of background do you have?
I see you intend to be childish about this. I guess I won't get anywhere continuing our discussion right now, will I?
Good. On which planet were you born?
Excellent. Your current age is?
Yes, well... The truth is I was studying *how* you responded to my questions. Your reactions help me judge you; this was a test for me to learn more about your character.
You were honest, which is good. And you treated this as a serious matter, which it is. This bond we share will shape both our destinies, it is not to be taken lightly.
Would you prefer it if I did?
Then I would hope a polite request would be enough to acquire co-operation.
You needn't be obstinate. I merely intend to ask some questions about your background, nothing intrusive.
There is no need to get upset over the matter. You could just as easily have been transferred aboard any other ship in the fleet, correct?
The fact that you were aboard the Endar Spire and survived the space battle should be a relief, I would think. Now, about my questions...
The crew was competent enough without meddling from the Jedi, Bastila, I'm quite sure.
Yet had I not done so, you would have had no assistance on Taris. Consider that.
Deny it if you will, but there is a connection between us. I understand why you would find this disturbing. I have my own reservations about it, to be honest.
Necessary, perhaps, but it is no guarantee of our success. I admit, I'm a little disturbed that such a bond could be possible in the first place.
I am not looking at you in any fashion.
As you wish. I am curious about something, however, and perhaps you can clarify the matter for me.
Very well. I have been curious about something, and perhaps you can clarify the matter for me.
You needn't be snide about it. Since you bring the matter up, I have been curious about something.
I would like to know what happened after you crashed on Taris. I'm curious as to what you and Carth were doing before we all joined forces.
Because I wish to know what happened. Why do you require another reason?
Whether you like my questions or not is irrelevant. You will answer.
I am not the one who is being 'touchy', now, am I? Answer the question.
Yes, I realize that of course. But surely there was more to it than a simple search. I doubt there were flashing signs pointing you in my direction; yet somehow you found me.
Yes... well. I hardly consider myself a damsel in distress. I'm a member of the Jedi Order, after all. But I won't deny you've impressed me with what you've done.
When you were chosen to join this mission, I doubt any of us expected this much from you. A Jedi could have done such things, of course. But only by drawing heavily upon the Force.
You... will?
I... of course not. Perhaps my questions are not necessary after all. It seems, however, that I shall have to keep a very close eye on you. A *very* close eye.
Maintain your cavalier attitude if you wish. This mission is too important to be left to chance.
You are reading too much into this. I simply refuse to leave anything about this mission to chance.
My 'problem' is none of your concern. I simply do not desire to leave anything about this mission to chance.
We shall continue this discussion later, perhaps. For now, let us continue with the task before us.
I see. You intend to be difficult, then, do you?
Very well. I shall be forced to keep a very close eye on you, then. A *very* close eye.
I am in command of this mission, according to the Jedi Council. Will you answer or not?
I don't think an interrogation is required, here. Nobody asked to be stranded on Taris or be forced into helping you, Bastila.
I don't remember asking for your opinion on this matter, Carth.
Hmph. Seems to me that maybe some Jedi princesses could use more time in captivity to improve their perspective.
Your objection is noted, Carth, but I still require answers... and I shall get them.
I managed to free myself, as I recall. In fact, if I hadn't been there Brejik and his thugs might have killed you in that fight. It's probably more accurate to say that I rescued you.
I escaped during the battle, which would have happened regardless. I also aided you during that fight, although I have no need to constantly remind you of it.
I'll admit that I probably wouldn't have been able to free myself if not for the brawl after the swoop race. I guess I should thank you for that, at least.
It is pointless to argue the matter. I still wish to know what happened before that incident.
It was less of a dream and more of a vision... a vision the two of us shared. But I am certainly willing to answer any questions the Jedi Council did not.
As you wish. We really should return our thoughts to business, anyway.
With luck we will.
I would rather not rely on such visions to guide us, but when we have so little else to go on and the galaxy hangs in the balance...
And are you so certain that it is not you in my dreams?
Regardless of which it is, our fates are linked... the vision was doubtless meant for us both.
I see. That is most likely vanity speaking, for I am not certain, myself. Regardless, our fates are linked... the vision was no doubt meant for us both.
I have no idea. It was obviously important, however. That is why we must investigate this further.
Perhaps because we desired to. Perhaps because they came to this planet and were strong enough in the Force to leave a... a trace.
And what else should we dream about except that which is most important to our fate?
They did something important here, of that I am certain. It may be simply that we are sensitive to that event. Or it may not.
That would not be my first choice, either, but choice appears to be irrelevant in this matter.
We dreamed about Revan and Malak either because we were meant to or because we needed to. There is no other way to look at it.
Are you wondering why we shared the vision? Or why we even received it in the first place?
To the first I can only repeat the answer that the Council gave us. Our fates are linked, and for two as strong as we are in the Force that amounts to a near-physical bond.
As to the second, I don't truly have an answer for you. The Force works as it will, and perhaps we should be grateful for what we have been given.
I... I don't know. Believe me, I certainly don't find the prospect of being joined to you enjoyable in any fashion.
The Force often seems to cause events that bend the laws of probability, especially with those that are strongly affiliated with it.
In this respect, you and I will simply have to become accustomed to such 'convienience'. We are the tools of the Force and we will do as it wills.
There is no evidence one way or the other. What you believe the Force to be ultimately will decide who you are.
What would you like to know?
Quite the contrary. Ours is the ultimate free will. The Force is our destiny, but the choices we make along it are ultimately our own.
The Force does not compel obedience. You have a destiny, but the choices you make along it are ultimately your own.
Then perhaps the sooner we see to our destiny the sooner that we can proceed on our separate paths. That seems the logical solution, no?
Please forgive me. I did not mean to imply that you were repulsive in any sense of the word. That we shared something so personal is just not something I'm used to.
Yes, but I don't feel any better. After all my training, I would have thought myself above such anger.
For it to come so easily disturbs me greatly. I don't need a holocron to remember my father, and I will never see Mother again.
Have I learned nothing? It... no, I don't want to talk about this. Thank you, but I must think about what I have done.
Yes. That brought me a lot of peace. More than I thought it would have.
Thank you for urging me towards it. After all my training, I would have thought it would have been easier. Apparently I still have much to learn.
I can try. What would you like me to recall?
I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...
I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...
I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...
I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...
There's nothing I could say that would be helpful, I'm afraid.
Korriban is a sparsely populated planet controlled by the Sith. It feels... wrong. There is an old evil here that permeates the Force.
Kashyyyk is a planet where most of what you see is actually foliage that has grown to enormous heights. No one has ever been to the true surface of the planet below.
Tatooine is a dry planet that has not been inhabited long and has little law. This town of Anchorhead may be its only settlement.
Manaan is a water world inhabited by an aquatic race known as the Selkath. Their only surface city and spaceport is called Ahto.
It is unique in that the Selkath are firm in their neutrality. They are neither part of the republic nor controlled by the Sith, and they wish to keep it that way.
Dantooine is a peaceful and pastoral planet. There are few large communities. Mostly what you will find here are ranchers and farmers.
I find it a tranquil place like few in the galaxy. The perfect site for the Jedi enclave. You will like it here.
The surface of Taris is covered with an urban skyscrape. Its glittering spires belie the decay that lies in its lower reaches, however.
Beyond that, there is little else I can tell you.
How can I help?
Hmm? Sorry, I am just thinking about my mother. It is strange to hear news after all this time. It is quite distracting.
Should we have the opportunity, I would like to find her on Tatooine. There is only one small colony there; it should not be difficult.
It's not that I look forward to seeing her, I just can't help but wonder what she wants. But... perhaps we have better things to do.
How can I help?
About my mother? I am unsure. I seem to find it difficult to remain objective when it comes to her. I find that... disturbing.
You're probably right. There are more important things to do. Mother can wait.
I told you that my mother and I never got along. Obviously that has not changed.
And now Father is dead. That... leaves a hurt inside, you just can't imagine. I haven't seen him in so long...
I have my doubts as to whether she's actually sick.
Mother used to lie about many things to get her way. She is a selfish woman who pushed my father into doing what she wished.
Yes, I... thought I had let go of that anger. All my training, and it comes back so quickly...
I don't want to talk about this any more. Let's... keep going.
Do you think I should?
I find myself agreeing with you, but I don't like how that feels.
I'll think about it. I should... try and remember my training. I should be able to let go of this, but I can't.
I would like to keep something to remember Father as much as she would.
That would just lead into another argument. How I always despised talking to her.
We have more important things to do. Still... my father is dead. Just because we find the holocron doesn't mean I have to give it to her.
Yes... maybe. I don't feel good about it, still.
It does, doesn't it? I can't seem to help myself.
I don't know. Part of me would keep it just so she didn't get it. I don't like that part of me.
I would have thought my Jedi training would have put me past this kind of pettiness. I wish... I really don't want to think about this.
Please, let's just keep going.
Father recorded all his personal thoughts in that holocron even when I knew him. Having it would be like having him with you.
I don't see why she deserves it, however. She drove him to his death. I loved him... and I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye.
I feel the end of our quest is near. Soon we will discover the location of the Star Forge; though what will happen next is... uncertain.
I've been watching you. I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occassions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.
I've been watching you. I've seen how you have resisted great temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable.
The path of the light is a difficult one to walk. We might not even see the shadows until we are surrounded and can never find our way back.
My role in what you will become is a small one. I can only give you the warnings taught to me by my own master, ultimately it is your own actions that will decide your fate.
I know we have not spoken often during our time together, despite my best efforts. And to this point I have respected your privacy. But there is something we must discuss.
No, this cannot wait any longer. You have no understanding of what we are going up against; I will not allow you to go in unprepared!
Never mind.
Do you have something you want to say to me, Bastila?
Why? What do you think will happen to you?
So what does this mean for us?
And I feel more alive when I'm with you.
I can't promise that. Who knows what will happen?
I'll see things through, I promise.
When we last talked you said you needed time to think. So?
Yes, I think so.
What are you talking about?
I really don't want to hear this...
What is it supposed to be like?
What are you trying to say, exactly?
Oh? I think I need some physical proof of that...
Sorry, Bastila. That starship won't fly. I'm not interested.
Oh. When will you know for sure?
Are you interested in me or in my ability to use the Force?
But I don't feel anything for you, Bastila.
You could leave, if you had to.
You make it sound like a death sentence.
No. Nothing.
It doesn't matter. Nothing can come of it.
Yes, I think so.
No, I suppose not.
I'd like to talk about what you said before. About giving in to your emotions.
Oh, get over yourself, already.
No, I disagree!
Why do you say that?
Oh? You see that, too? I don't need you anymore.
You're doing your best, I'm sure.
So what now?
You're being too hard on yourself.
Maybe we could help each other?
How did you expect me to be?
I don't need your help, anyway. I can find my own way.
You're curious about something?
Go ahead.
I don't think about it much.
It sounds like you have your own demons to face.
What?
I think destroying that kind of evil would be worth it.
Are you saying you don't believe in the corruption of the dark side?
It's a struggle for me, sometimes.
I just do what I think is right.
Maybe a little, sure.
Life's too short to be afraid.
No. You should try it yourself, sometime.
Do I have a choice?
You look like you have something to say.
You made that sound very painful for you to admit.
Thank you. I appreciate the gesture.
Don't forget edgy, critical and overly secretive.
I'm glad you did.
We'll see.
Great, you've had your say. Now leave me alone - for good!
Maybe, but you don't need to be like that.
Nonsense. You're not self-absorbed or stodgy.
Too little, too late. Sorry.
I'd like that, I suppose.
Oh? How close a friend would you like to be?
Forgive me if I don't trust your motives, exactly.
Then leave me alone. For good.
Friends? You could have fooled me.
Just leave me alone... for good.
*May* have been?
And when have you ever made things easy for me?
Your compliments need some work, I think.
What was that? I think I'm going deaf. You better say it again.
It's just that you sounded so pained saying it.
I'm still reeling from the shock. Was that a compliment?
Is that a compliment? From you?
You're kidding, right?
Fine. Thank you for the thought.
You can keep your thanks. I don't need it... or you.
Maybe I was just distracted by the grudging manner in which it was given.
Why did the Council send me with you on this mission?
And that's it? That's enough reason for you to accept all this?
I get the feeling that there's more going on than I know.
It was only a question. Can't I be curious?
Why not? I ignore them in yours.
What subtle accusations?
Oh, great. Another lecture. This never gets old.
Me? You're the one who thought this was her big audition for 'Masterhood'!
Hey, you started this.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Look... you either know the answer or you don't.
And if I don't believe you?
Maybe a little bit.
What can I say? It's fun.
Lighten up. I'm only joking.
Hey, you brought this on yourself.
Careful. Remember your self-control.
Maybe you shouldn't try.
Complain all you want, but I know you love it.
You could try being straight with me, for once.
I'm not so bad. You just have to learn to accept me for what I am.
I just don't trust the Council and their motives.
It just seems odd they would send me off without a Master to guide me.
You wish to talk to me?
What? You've been grading me?
My progress?
What are you trying to tell me?
Stop with the dramatics, already, I get the picture.
How can you know it is so terrible?
I couldn't see myself ever doing such things.
Must we keep discussing this?
Do whatever is required? Such as?
Perhaps it's just the reasoning for those acts you don't accept.
I don't know.
Are you saying the light side is innocent of killing?
You seem to know that temptation very well.
What do you know about it?
We're not going to go over this again, are we?
I'd like to know more about you, Bastila.
What?! You're not even a Jedi?
And yet you act like a Jedi...
Tell me how you joined the Jedi, then.
So the Jedi separates children from their families?
Discouraged? Why?
Don't you miss your family at all?
That must have been difficult.
I don't need to hear the family history, thanks.
Are you saying you no longer feel love?
But if a Jedi were to love, surely it wouldn't be all bad.
You sound very sad when you say that.
You and your father were close?
Who weren't you on good terms with?
That sounds idiotic. I would never agree to that.
Why wouldn't you be allowed to love?
And what's so wrong with that?
You need to lighten up.
It just seems wrong not to be allowed to love.
I don't need you reminding me, I assure you.
Sounds like you're the one afraid of falling.
You aren't allowed to love?
You don't sound very convinced.
You wanted to speak to me?
That's not the half of it!
Meaning what?
Thank you.
I'd like to know what you do about this mission.
Okay, forget I asked anything.
Oh, great. I never get tired of hearing how you killed Darth Revan.
Let me ask something else, then.
Nothing. Never mind.
Is it true you killed Darth Revan?
So who killed Revan, then?
But killing Revan is what you're famous for.
That's not what I heard.
But you would have killed Revan eventually, right?
What else did you expect from the Sith?
So Malak did your job for you.
Tell me what you know about the dark side.
So just why have you been so hard on me since we met?
Why the sudden change of tune?
And that's it? All is forgiven?
You have something you want to ask me?
I don't know. It seemed time for another interrogation?
Educated guess, from the way you keep staring.
Well... your face is all scrunched up like a kinrath pup.
Maybe.
No, I doubt it.
What do you mean?
What do you think I should do?
I will try.
I won't do anything to hurt you.
I doubt I'll be a risk to the mission.
I would appreciate any help you could offer.
I don't need your help.
It works both ways, doesn't it? You could help me stay strong.
So you're just worried about yourself, then.
I don't need you harassing me, thanks.
Why are you getting so upset?
I don't think mastering my emotions is necessary.
You could warn me when I do something bad. Blink once for dark side, twice for light.
You look like something's bothering you.
I still don't understand this bond of ours.
Our relationship? Is this some kind of clumsy come-on?
What sort of questions?
Forget it. I'm not interested.
Fine, fine, ask your questions.
Nothing with the Jedi is ever simple.
I'm sick of answering questions!
Alright, ask away.
I'm a Hutt in human form plotting to overthrow the Republic.
Nothing extravagant. I'm a soldier.
I was a scout. The fleet recruited me for my skills.
I was a smuggler before I joined the fleet.
Kashyyyk. I'm a Wookiee... can't you tell?
Deralia. It's in a remote system. Why?
3,012. Healthy living, you know.
Alright, I've had enough.
Wasn't all this in my service records?
And what did you find out?
You're not going to demand answers this time?
No, of course not.
Why not? My answer would be the same.
Wait a minute... I have you to blame for being on that ship?
I don't believe in this 'bond', regardless of what the Jedi Council said.
Doesn't the bond mean my presence is necessary?
You want to talk to me about something?
Good. Let's keep it that way.
If you have something to say, just say it.
Well, gosh, it must just be my overactive imagination.
Why do you want to know?
Because I don't like being interrogated.
I don't. No need to be touchy about it.
So I know exactly what you're looking for.
We were looking for you.
And rescued the damsel in distress. Don't forget that.
I'll be happy to answer whatever questions you have.
You're surprised?
Whatever makes you happy, I guess.
What did I do to deserve this?
Look, I don't know what your problem is...
Sorry, I have better things to do.
No more difficult than you.
Hey! Just who do you think you are, anyway?
Before we rescued you, you mean.
Have it your way, then.
You didn't escape the Black Vulkars until we arrived, as I recall.
Can't you just admit that you were rescued?
You just did!
I want to talk about that dream.
Never mind.
Do you think we will receive more of these visions?
I'm not sure I like the idea of you being in my dreams.
I suppose that's possible.
Pretty certain, yes.
What do you think Malak and Revan were doing?
Why did we dream of Malak and Revan?
Isn't it a bit convenient to dream about our enemies?
What do you mean by a 'trace'?
Well, I certainly didn't want to dream about them.
I still don't understand why we shared this 'vision'.
But how did our fates become linked?
It just seems a little... convenient.
You make the Force sound alive.
That's all I wanted to know.
I have another question.
We have no free will of our own, then?
Not me! I do what I want.
Believe me, the feeling is mutual.
Well, thanks a lot.
So you kept the holocron.
So do you feel better now?
Can you show me one of the visions again?
The vision we had on Tatooine.
The vision we had on Kashyyyk.
The vision we had on Manaan.
The vision we had on Korriban.
Do you know anything about this place?
Do you want to talk?
Do you want to talk?
I don't think we have time to go searching for anything.
She certainly seemed to upset you.
Why didn't you ask about her sickness?
Why would she lie about it?
You sound bitter.
Are you going to give the holocron to her?
Probably not. She doesn't deserve it.
Do you need it more than she does?
You might want to consider it.
You don't think we should look for the holocron?
Maybe you're right.
That sounds a bit selfish.
You'd keep it for yourself?
Why do you think she wants it so badly?
I'm sorry, Bastila. I will try to do better.
I don't need a lecture from you. Not now, not ever.
Don't worry. The dark side has no sway over me.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
I don't want to talk to you! Can't you take a hint?
Not now, Bastila.
Fine. What is it?
So deal with it. Why are you asking me about it?
What? You think I don't have something better to do?
Yeah? What do you want?
Your choice. I'm here if you want something done right.
This thing with Jagi... I... I don't know. Give me some time and I'll be able to sort this out on my own.
Is there something else you wanted?
I'm not happy with the way my life has turned. I'm not the Mandalore I once was. I don't even think I'm the merc I was when I joined you.
I think... I think I need something more than killing and fighting in my life. I need a purpose or something like that.
Killing is never enough. Anybody can kill just by pushing a button. A warrior fights his battles himself - as you have done - and tries to defeat all comers.
The way the Mandalorians - we - fought... it holds no appeal for me. To rape and ravage worlds for the thrill of battle... It gets old. Very old.
Honor in battle. Cheating death. Comrades in arms. The code of the Mandalore.
I think I'm something different now. Maybe more, maybe less.
I don't think there is really any place left in the galaxy for the Mandalorian clans like they were. I don't know if I can go on forever fighting as I have. Even warriors get insightful in their old age...
No... The time of the clans is past. I don't think the galaxy wants them anymore. Maybe in the future, but not now.
Once my time with you is done, once you have moved on to greater things, I'll find my own way once again.
Maybe the Mandalorian clans will be reborn again. Maybe even under the Republic... or the Sith.
But dreaming about the future is stupid right now. We should get down to our business and finish it. If we survive all this... maybe we could talk about it then.
Working for Davik was like driving a spike through the side of your head... Sure you get something new in there, but in the end, you've lost something as well.
Beating up people who wouldn't - or couldn't - pay, strong-arming his competitors, killing who he said. It was busy work, nothing decent.
Maybe...
I've killed many people. I can't say I'm proud of it, but I have. Criminals, competitors, businessmen, police... women, children...
Jedi were a better challenge, but they hardly ever poked around in the Under City.
... Until you came along...
But I never wanted to challenge you. Never felt the need. Maybe I knew I couldn't win... just like all those years ago.
Maybe you would have. But you're not who you were back then, I can tell. You've changed... and maybe I have too.
I remember a time when I could do anything I wanted... Kill, maim, murder... It was all the same to me.
But now... now that I'm older, I can look back and regret...
Ha! Good one. That's like a warrior should. Like what you see in a Mandalorian.
In a Mandalorian... I'm not even sure what that is anymore. The Mandalorian are gone, defeated by the Republic and swept away by time.
I look back and regret all the chances I had as a warrior, and then all the chances I've had since then. I shouldn't be getting like this, not when so many other things are happening... but...
It feels like... like something has changed inside and I don't know what it is. Bah! This is unbecoming of a warrior! Let's get on with everything before I start getting sentimental or something.
Yeah, probably. Heh. You'd likely have beaten me again.
Assassin. Mercenary. Those are names people give guys like me who do the killing to make us seem better or worse in their eyes.
The war we had with the Republic was supposed to be the most glorious battle of our history, but... it was a very costly one. I guess we didn't think of how much we could lose in it.
Yeah... yeah you did. You were a great warrior Revan. A great general.
There weren't many of us left after that last battle. Mandalore himself was killed at the hands of the Jedi Revan. The best of us could not defeat him!
After that last battle, those of us that survived were stripped of our weapons, our armor, and our Basilisks.
The Republic's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.
Revan's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.
For many this was not enough. While the rest of us were sent into exile on the Outer Rim, they tried to relive the old days - raiding worlds. They're nothing more than bandits now.
Yeah. I found work on Taris.
Yeah, I came to Taris.
Enforcing for Davik was not... stimulating. The gangs on Taris and Davik's rivals were trash. They give no thrill in battle, no honor or glory in defeating them. It was like stepping on bugs.
I sought worthy challenges, but the best that Taris could offer were nothing to me.
But I think now - with you - I may finally find opponents worth fighting.
Maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't. Either way, I think that by following you I can get something out of it.
Maybe later I'll tell you more about what it was like to work for Davik. For now, though, we should get on with our lives.
We fought against the Republic forces for some time, over the course of many battles.
At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once the Jedi Revan had taken charge, things began to turn against us.
The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. Revan was a genius on the field.
We've... we've already been over this. It was a moment of weakness, a stumble brought on by unbridled passions. But my emotions are firmly in check once more.
We need to stay focused on stopping Darth Malak. And I want the others to stay focused as well. I don't want them to get suspicious and start gossiping about our little encounter!
Revan abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike, and was willing to make sacrifices in order to advance goals.
And in the end, Revan proved too much for us.
The Sith had gone - retreated into their empire. They sealed themselves off from the rest of the galaxy. We thought it would be centuries before they'd come back.
It's amazing that they could rebuild their fleet so fast. But at the time, it looked like the galaxy was in our grasp!
There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind Revan. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.
It looked like the entire galaxy was within our grasp!
I still remember that final battle in the skies above Malachor V. The two fleets filling the space around it, outshining the stars...
It was not your ships or your men or your vaunted 'fight for freedom' that won this, the final battle of the war.
It was by the actions of one person - you - that the Republic prevailed.
Your strategies and tactics defeated the best we could send against you. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity of your attacks, the tenacity of your defenses and the subtleties of your plans.
You fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.
It was by the actions of one person, the Jedi Revan, that you prevailed.
So, until our mission is over we need to act with discretion. We shouldn't speak of this anymore... not until Malak is defeated!
I'm... afraid so. Although I suppose I should thank you for all you've done. For the lessons you helped me learn.
Revan's strategies and tactics defeated the best of us. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity, the tenacity and the subtlety of Revan's plans.
Revan fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.
Ha! Don't be naive. The Republic is not invincible. This battle was the end of the war, one way or another.
It was what we had wanted all along, in a way. We wanted to fight the best in a battle that would be remembered for centuries. And we did.
And you won.
I hold no grudge against you, nor do any of my people. It was the greatest of honors to fight against you, even in defeat. It is even more of an honor to fight beside you now.
Had you been born of the Mandalorian clans, surely nothing in this galaxy would have been able to stop us.
And Revan won.
I wish it could be otherwise, but you have to understand that this is the way it must be. I am a Jedi, after all.
I hope you can put this behind you. You need to focus on stopping Malak, as difficult as that may be. Come, we should continue our mission.
I don't hold a grudge against Revan, and neither do any of my people. It was the greatest moment of my life to be in that battle.
If Revan had been a Mandalorian, nothing in the galaxy would have stopped us.
But wishing for the past to be different is useless. Better to look to the future. As we should now. We'll talk more later, I think.
Yeah, we lost. But there is no shame in it. We lost to the greatest single warrior the Republic has ever known.
But it was close! So close!
At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once you had taken charge, things began to turn against us.
The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. You were a genius on the field. You are held in very high regard among my people.
You abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike. You made sacrifices in order to advance your goals. Such strategies had never been enough to best us before.
In the end, you proved too much for us.
There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind you. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.
Hm... I think I'll tell you a bit about the recent war we had with the Republic. That might be more familiar to you.
The one where the Jedi Revan beat my people.
We started by conquering worlds just outside the Republic. We did it quietly so the Republic wouldn't really know what was going on until too late.
When we finally did hit the Republic worlds, they had no idea we were coming.
We came in through three invasion corridors in adjacent sectors. Anyone who put up a fight - or wouldn't fight - was crushed. We razed whole worlds trying to provoke the Republic into fighting us.
I don't particularly enjoy wiping out worlds for its own sake, but the cowardly tactics the Republic defenders used left us little choice.
They had the choice not to fight. We meet the enemy wherever they are hiding and we wipe them out. A few cities is a small price to pay for a world.
Hiding in the homes of civilians. Using families as shields. Thinking we would not use appropriate force on their bases inside major cities.
They underestimated our resolve and what measures are acceptable in war. Those who cannot defend themselves should not be around those who can in battle.
If annihilating a city is the kind of power it takes to overwhelm a Republic shield device, then that's what we did. Necessary force to destroy all opposition.
It's wrong to hide with shields surrounding you hoping the enemy will be so good as to throw themselves at your feet to be slaughtered!
I have no time or patience for cowards! They deserve to be hunted down and exterminated like vermin!
There was no honor in wiping them out like rats. But some of your forces did redeem the Republic in our eyes... especially later...
Later... when Revan had joined the war. But we'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.
Later... when you had joined the war. We'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.
The one where you beat my people.
I don't have as many strange stories like the last one I told you, but I do have a couple about me and the stuff I've done.
In one battle above the world of Althir, my unit managed to defeat a force of Althiri ten times our own size. That battle gained me command of an entire sub-sect of my clan.
Ha! I was the best! Except for Mandalore of course. He was the only person alive except Revan who could have beat me.
For five days they had managed to hold off our forces, keeping us to the outer rings of their world, preventing us from attacking it directly.
My task was to assault one of their flanks with a false attack. The Althiri would be drawn out by the units I had sent in.
Once they had surrounded those units, the bulk of my forces would attack from the rear and defeat them in detail.
They weren't stupid. Stupid races don't make starships and weapons of mass destruction. But they weren't masters of the arts of war as Mandalorians are.
Things did not go as I had planned. I saw an opening - a mistake they had made in the disposition of their forces - and took it!
While fending off our main force, they had let their fleet split in two! The center of their entire fleet was left exposed!
I turned my forces and assaulted the center of their fleet, decimating them!
This is a chance given to a warrior once or twice in a lifetime. The chance to change the course of history in a single act.
Their slow, ponderous ship could not turn to face us without being overwhelmed. Their command vessels were destroyed in seconds. Their ranks were thrown into chaos.
It was most amusing to watch the surviving ships scatter and flee. Several even tried to dive through the plane of the rings to escape us!
They were shredded by the rings, or crashed into rocks, or were destroyed by our forces as we pursued them.
Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against your Jedi Revan.
Another time maybe I'll tell you about how the war with the Republic went. For now let's just get on with things.
Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against you.
You want another story, eh? You want to hear about some other world getting wasted? Heh, I knew you were the type.
Your stagnant Republic has never seen some of the strange creatures and races we fought on the Outer Rim in those years. Heh, and you never will now.
If a world isn't strong enough to defend itself, it's basically forfeit. But this story is about something a little different.
We were going through the asteroid fields of the Crispin system at the very edge of the galaxy, playing with the pirates and smugglers we found there.
The main belt in the Crispin system consists of mainly small rocks covered in frozen methane gas shells and the pirates were using them for cover.
Ha! I remember using a thermal generator to cause the outer layer of one of the asteroids to vaporize in a picosecond. It blew out and shredded the three smugglers using it for cover!
But... that was a mistake...
The asteroid I had targeted was smaller than most, maybe a dozen meters on a side. On the outside it looked the same as any other: just a ball covered in frozen gas.
But something must have been inside it... something inactive in the cold. The heat of my blast might have triggered something or woken something up.
After I had hit, spots of light and heat appeared all over the thin shell still covering it, evaporating the gases.
What lay underneath looked like some sort of rocky growth... a deformed rock pitted by scores of micrometeorite scars. I think something even older might have been inside that.
It started rotating - faster and faster as we watched it. After a second it started spraying fire - thermal projectiles that melted our armor like wax. We were caught completely by surprise.
Before we could counter-attack, it fled at an incredible speed.
We couldn't catch it, but we could follow its hyperspace wake.
We followed its trail as far as we could, heading away from the galactic core. When it finally led beyond the edge of our galaxy, we abandoned our efforts.
Anything that wants to commit suicide in that great void is not worth our trouble trying to catch.
That's the only story I have for now. I'll tell you some more stuff later, if we get the chance.
Maybe... but maybe not.
I was one of the best youth warriors in clan Ordo in my time. No one before me had mastered the power of our Basilisk war droids as quickly as I had. Except Mandalore himself of course.
In those days we were sweeping across the Outer Rim. Destroying all who fought us.
Young Mandalores would prove themselves in real combat with unknown opponents above a thousand worlds. Each brought back the story of his achievements.
We were still recovering from the war we fought with the Sith. We were not yet strong enough to fight the Republic again. We needed to train another generation to do that.
Ha! We would travel from world to world, and descend on it in our Basilisk war droids. I still remember my first combat...
I remember it well, orbiting high above a placid world, its defenses just stirring. As was tradition, I would go ahead of the first wave to find enemies in the thickest fighting.
I remember sitting there in my armor, linked directly with the Basilisk thrumming beneath me. My heart racing with fear at the coming battle.
Every new warrior has to fear to understand how to beat it. You must know that.
The doors opened in front me and the air was sucked out of the drop bay, scattering crystals of frozen vapor across my path.
I can't describe what it feels like to look directly down at a world, falling continuously as you circle it, with barely fifteen centimeters of armor plate protecting you.
When the magnetic locks disengaged on my droid I plunged out of the drop bay towards the battle that waited below.
I don't remember. It doesn't matter anyway, that world's dead now.
The exhilaration, the euphoria, I felt as I streaked into the atmosphere, dodging self-guided projectile and beam weapons, was unmatched.
A 80 kilometer plunge through the atmosphere, dodging and weaving, the outside of my armor glowing like the sun with the heat of re-entry.
And with barely thirty meters to spare, I twisted and skimmed the surface, firing at the giant beam generators that were in my path.
The explosion from that sent shockwaves that levelled the entire complex around it. It was the moment of my life.
I'll never forget those times. But... things are different now. We can't go on fighting the way we had. There are too few of us left now.
But I don't really want to talk about this anymore. I trust I've satisfied your curiosity for now?
Is there something else you want to know?
You want to hear tales of my exploits? Of the wars I've seen and fought, the enemies I've seen die by my hand? Heh, sure, I'll humor you.
My name's Canderous of the Mandalorian clan Ordo. I've been fighting across the galaxy for 40 of your years.
For my people it's the honor and glory of battle that rules us. It's through combat that we prove our worth, gain renown and make our fortunes.
Win or lose, as long as the fight is worthy, then honor is gained. The glory at having triumphed over impossible odds is what drives us.
If there's nothing at stake - your possessions, your life, your world - then the battle's meaningless.
We Mandalore take everything we are and throw it into battle. It's the true test of yourself - the battle against death... against oblivion.
The days of combat and glory and cheating death at every turn seem to be over now... I take what I can.
All life dies eventually. A true warrior is one who can beat it down whenever it raises its head. But...
The Sith came to us with an offer: to fight a worthy enemy in a battle that would be remembered forever.
Times have changed now. The Mandalore clans have been scattered across the Outer Rim, the Republic is in decline and the Sith Empire rises to take its place.
The clans as they were aren't a threat, but the galaxy still fears us. Ha! People think we war out of spite, or bloodlust. They don't understand, and fear that.
We only wanted the challenge of the battle, and glory from it - win or lose. And we lost.
But now I have no real challenges. Crushing Davik's enemies and the pathetic gangs in the Lower City of Taris could not be considered the most glorious of tasks.
When I think of the battles I've fought... the thousands I've killed... the worlds I've burned... I weep for my past.
We'll never speak of this again. We've got work to do, so let's get to it.
Heh, don't worry I think you've got enough there as it is. You don't want to go overloading youself on stims, otherwise you might destroy your adrenal system.
A real warrior knows his own limits and doesn't overestimate himself.
Ha! Stimulants make a warrior out of even the weakest human!
Here's a stamina boosting stimulant to help you get tougher.
Here's a strength boosting stimulant to help you get stronger.
Here's a speed boosting stimulant to help you get quicker.
There anything else you need?
This world is... odd. It looks like a battlefield, but the environment here is lush and green. Whatever happened here was a long time ago.
I have seen many strange worlds in my time, but this world is stranger still.
I don't like this place. Something happened... or is happening here and I don't like it. We should get out of here as soon as possible.
Korriban is a Sith world, that's for sure. I mean, just look at this place.
When we were fighting with the Republic with the Sith, this was one of the major staging points for the invasion.
We were never allowed to land our troops on the world though, so we never knew what the Sith really do here.
Rumor has it that the leader of our clans at the time, Mandalore, did go down. They say the Sith perform terrible magics here.
Tatooine is one big desert with rocks sticking out. I heard that some of my people came here after the war, but I don't know what happened to them.
The world of my clan - Ordo - was much like this. Dust basins and rock crags. But my world at least has some green around the equator - this place is just sand all over.
There are some vicious people on this world, but the desert is the real enemy. Trips out in the desert - especially the deep desert - should be taken very carefully.
Well... It has big trees - in case your eyes don't work anymore. But I do know that there is one exceptional race on this world: the Wookiees.
The Wookiees, although primitive compared to us, are surprisingly capable warriors. They're pretty strong and pick up combat techniques pretty quick.
I think they're more than a match for the average Republic or Sith trooper. When we were looking for targets, we considered this world carefully.
We were wondering if we'd have to use larger weapons than our war droids if we wanted to clear the damn forests so we could fight in the open.
Too many trees means they can go into hiding too easy. And what's a continent or two turned to glass if we get the whole world after.
Water worlds never had much of an appeal for us to conquer. They may put up a good fight in their own environment - no match for us, of course - but they don't really have anything of value either.
The thing this world is good for is a substance known as Kolto. Kolto is the single best healing substance in the galaxy.
But the Mandalore are not as weak and fragile as your Republic and Sith warriors. When we enter battle, we carry weapons powerful enough to pulverize cities.
Both in our wars, and in our own personal combats, there are no survivors. So Kolto does not hold the appeal it does for your peoples.
From what we saw from space this world doesn't have a lot of people. I couldn't really have found much work here anyway, so I never had an interest.
It looks like a farm world. The Republic has thousands of these places - ones that get by farming crops and hunting herds of native beasts.
But I might have underestimated this place. It seems to be more than I had thought.
*grunt* Yeah, I know about Taris. I wasted the last two years in this rat-hole working for Davik.
I suppose an accurate way to describe this place would be 'cesspool' or 'dump'.
You got the rich people on top, the poor people being crushed underneath, and people like me trying to make a living doing the crushing.
It's not exactly what you'd call spiritually fulfilling work, but it gets the bills paid. And on Taris, money can go a long way to making things easier.
You have anything else you want to ask?
I... I think this has affected me in ways that I didn't anticipate... I think I'll need time to sort things out.
Thanks for what you did, whatever your intentions might have been. I just need... time.
I've been given a challenge I can't ignore. We've got to go to the dune seas of Tatooine so I can find Jagi and kill him for his insult to me!
The sooner we get to Tatooine the better.
This is between me and Jagi. You don't have to get involved. If you're lucky, he might spill something before I spread him in a paste over the dunes.
This looks like the end of our partnership. The battle we fight here will change the face of the galaxy.
You, Revan, are the single greatest warrior of this age, and any battle we fight will bring me honor. I'll stay by your side through anything.
I don't think I'm ready to give up this life of mine, this life of fighting, not quite yet. We have things we need to do here.
I'm your man until the end, whatever path you take.
I don't think we can delay much here. We should fight our way out as quickly as possible.
Nothing more for now.
What are your thoughts now?
What are your thoughts now?
That doesn't sound much like a Mandalorian...
Isn't killing enough?
What will you do?
What are you going to do?
You aren't a Mandalorian now?
Tell me about when you worked for Davik.
Now that's the way things should be done!
Killed his competitors?
You know I'd have beaten you again!
I regret to tell you that I never regret anything.
Over what?
Regret in a Mandalorian is unbecoming.
A wise decision.
You were an assassin?
Tell me more about the Mandalorian Wars.
But I kicked your tails so badly?
There must not have been many of you left.
You found work as a mercenary?
And you eventually came to Taris.
Opponents who could easily kill us.
You are a worthy companion.
I am honored.
How much did you lose?
But what about the Sith?
If Revan had not stopped you, someone else would have.
What happened in the battle?
The Republic will always prevail.
Why didn't you retreat?
But you eventually lost.
You couldn't have won against the whole galaxy.
If I had not stopped you, someone else would have.
I was wondering if you had any more war stories.
You had the choice not to destroy them.
No honor in defending themselves?
What do you mean?
Now that's my kind of warfare.
You could have found another way.
But killing people is wrong!
You mean when we kicked your tails.
How did they redeem themselves?
Later?
Yeah, yeah, you were a great warrior.
I think I know where this is going.
Tell me the story.
These Althiri don't seem too bright.
Let me guess... you won?
Ah. Did it work?
What did they do?
You disobeyed your orders?
You were a great warrior Canderous.
Where did you fight this time?
What do you mean?
You Mandalorians never were too smart.
Did it backfire?
Why? What happened?
What happened next?
A ship!
An asteroid?
I would have harnessed that power sooner.
How barbaric!
What was your story?
What happened next?
Ha! Some Mandalorian you were!
Who were you fighting anyway?
Those droids sure are something.
You dropped from orbit riding a droid?!
I want a Basilisk war droid!
That was some fight.
That's horrible!
I didn't think Mandalorians got afraid.
I was wondering if you had any interesting stories.
The Mandalorians destroy worlds for honor?
Then what are you doing now?
You seek death?
Is that why the Mandalorians attacked the Republic?
Is that why you work as a mercenary?
Can you give me some adrenal stimulants?
Do you know anything about this world?
We should get going then.
Can we talk about this?
What happened out there? Why is Jagi so mad at you?
Sorry. I can't be of much help with that.
I'm not really sure. You can figure it out on your own, can't you?
Yes? What's on your mind?
You got it.
If you're ready to talk, then yes... so am I.
I can't hate you. I tried... I wanted to hold you responsible for all the things you've done. For my... for my wife, for Telos... for Dustil. But I can't.
Maybe you shouldn't. I would hope that my standing by you would mean something to you, but maybe it doesn't. Maybe it just can't.
I got the revenge I always wanted when Saul died, but it hasn't brought me the peace that I thought it would.
All I can think of now is the promise I made to protect you from what's going to come. It's given me a reason to look past simple revenge.
Despite whatever part of Revan is inside you, the... the darkness that must surely be there, it isn't who you are.
That's why I can't hate you, why I don't want any more revenge. You don't have to be Revan, you can be so much more. Whatever the Jedi did to you, they gave you that chance.
You have this huge destiny waiting for you, and I just fear that if you're alone it could swallow you whole. I mean, is there room in there for me? Will you let me help you?
Oh. I had... hoped that there might be. I don't blame you. Uh. You're not the same woman I met on Taris anymore, are you?
Well, thank you for your honesty. I still intend to see this through to the end, whatever happens. Malak needs to be stopped.
And uh, you... you'll make the decision you have to. And we'll have to deal with that day when it comes.
I think I would be hurt worse if I didn't try.
Whatever's happened up until this point, there's going to come a time very soon where you're going to have to make a choice. And there won't be any turning back.
I want you to make the right choice. I want to give you a reason to.
You gave me a future. I want to give you a future, too... with me. I think I could love you, if you give me the chance.
Neither do I. But does that really matter if we love each other?
Well then I'm... I'm glad. Let's... let's face the future together, then... there's still a lot to do.
Well then I hope I can save you. From yourself.
You have a darkness inside you that must be Revan. But there's more to you, as well. I see it, I know it's there.
I do. It's serious, though... I need your attention. Is this a good time?
Alright. We'll talk later, then.
Alright. I'm, uh... I'm concerned about you. I've been keeping these thoughts to myself, mostly, but I think it's time I say something.
It's about you. I'm worried about what might happen to you. You have a lot of courage, and the fact you've remained strong is amazing, but there is even greater danger ahead.
I think you might be setting yourself up for a fall. Maybe at the urging of the Jedi, I don't know... but you're definitely going to become a target.
If, uh... if I'm going to find some purpose beyond taking revenge on Saul, then it's going to have to be in protecting you.
I don't know why, but I think some terrible fate is waiting for you. I think the Jedi Council knows it, too. And I don't want that to come to pass.
Don't chalk it up to my paranoia just yet. Something isn't right. I blamed it on you, before, but I... I think the Jedi didn't tell us everything.
If I'm going to live past Saul, I need you to, as well. Let me protect you... from yourself, from the Sith... you have to let me try.
I, uh... I guess I have no other choice. I will still help you, if I can... but I guess you're on your own.
If that's the way you want it, I hope things go well. Let's, uh... let's get back to what we were doing.
I'm glad to hear that. I'll do my best.
Because... because I never got the chance to save my wife and son. Because I didn't stop Saul when I had the chance.
Because I finally have the chance to do it right. You are an extraordinary woman... you make me think that maybe I might have some purpose beyond revenge.
I don't know whether it means anything to you... but it does to me.
I know that there's going to come a day when you'll look in the mirror and wonder how you ever got to become what you are... and by then it will be too late.
I *sigh* I... don't know. I'm not the best of men, and I'm not the strongest fighter there is... but I'll find a way.
That's where I think you're wrong. You can't do this on your own. Nobody could.
It's about you. I'm worried about what you're doing to yourself... how much you've succumbed to violence and anger.
I knew it was possible for this to happen to you... and it just pains me to see it. I've been down this path. And I don't recommend it.
Oh. I hadn't thought you'd noticed...
Well, I ah... I've just been admiring you. Not, uhh, not anything like that, though...
I've been watching you in action. Your, your skills... you have a natural talent that is incredible.
Not that, ah, all I do is watch you or anything. I don't mean anything by it.
Oh. Right. I'll, ah, I'll just pay attention to what I'm doing...
Well... maybe a few. I hope you won't mind if I keep those to myself.
Ha! Why didn't you tell me that sooner? You would have saved me a lot of trouble.
I will say one thing, however. We've come a long way with your help. Whether it's the Force or fate or just dumb luck... I'm glad you're here.
We probably would have never made it this far without you. I... should have said this long before, instead of doubting you. I, ah, hope you can forgive me.
Err... what do you mean?
What am I supposed to say? I was wrong. I was a stubborn fool. I... Look, I have trouble admitting it when a beautiful woman has my number...ok?
Sorry. Didn't mean to... embarass you. I'll stop.
I'll, ah, take that as a yes. I'm glad that's settled. Shall we... shall we get back to what we were doing?
And you accepted it... but that doesn't mean I'm forgiven. I'd like to be.
I guess I'm a proud man. I... don't admit things like this easily.
Thank you. Let's, ah... let's get back to what we were doing.
Because you're an impressive and beautiful woman. In some ways... good ways... you remind me of my wife and I'd like to make things right between us.
I've been watching how you deal with people. You have a real finesse that is incredible to watch in action.
I've been watching you work on the com. Your skill with computers is incredible.
I've been watching you wield that lightsaber, actually. Your finesse with it is incredible.
You mean if I kill him?
I... never thought about it. I suppose I always assumed that I would be dead once Saul was.
That's never occurred to me. I've always been the captain of my own ship, after all... or thought about going after Saul on my own.
Understand that whenever I envisioned taking on Saul in the past, it was always as the captain of my own ship... or alone. In those cases I would risk everything.
I'm not in the same situation, now. I wouldn't risk hurting you... or the others.
You don't think I would throw away everything we're doing here, do you?
Of course it means something to me! The Sith have to be stopped! You think it doesn't matter to me that everyone on Taris is dead? That the Republic is in danger?
I would like to think that I wouldn't put you in danger. That I wouldn't forget that there's more behind Saul that needs to be stopped.
If I saw Saul, however... if I had the chance... I don't know what I would do. I really don't. I mean his death has been my entire focus for so long.
But, uh... maybe it's best I did. I have to see this through... and I will, to the end. I promise you that. No matter what.
I know. I'll... see this through. I promise you that. No matter what.
Well, that's easier said than done, but I know you mean well. I promise you I'll see this through. No matter what.
As for what comes afterward... well, let's wait until I know that I'm around to see it.
Oh... it's nothing. Sorry.
Moping? I'm not moping! I... okay, fine, maybe I'm moping a little, but you're very pushy, you know that?
I told you my wife died four years ago. I... I've just been trying to remember what she looked like.
It shouldn't be so difficult. I can remember things about her... things she did. The way she smiled, what her hair smelled like, our last fight... just not her face.
I try to hold it in my head but it's gone. Is... that strange? Maybe I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
That's a damned mean thing to say. I wasn't ready for her to go, I can't accept it. Alright?
But I *should* be able to remember her face. It's frustrating! I... feel like I'm losing her.
I, uh... it must look really strange for me to be obsessing like this, still. You must think I'm incredibly stupid.
She isn't a ghost to me. I still remember holding her as she died... and I doubt I'll forget until I've paid Saul back in kind.
That's all I have left: finding Saul and killing the scum. Don't worry... I won't waste any more time until then.
Maybe. It can't be worse than what I tell myself, sometimes.
I... suppose you're probably right. But I have to do it, anyway.
The only thing that's kept me going since she died has been the need to find Saul and kill him. It's better to think about that than... anything else.
If I can do that, then maybe I can let her go. Let it all go.
If we encounter Saul... if we ever have the chance, promise me that I will be the one to kill him. I have to settle this... I need to.
Whether it does or not, that's the way it has to be. I... guess there's no need to discuss it until then.
Thank you. I... guess there's really nothing else to say.
Ahhh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned it, even if you asked. I just find you, I don't know... easy to talk to.
To think that I once looked up to those two as the best that humanity had to offer. Now I'd like nothing more than to put a blaster to both their heads.
Although I suppose only Malak is left, isn't he? Turned on his own master, not that Revan didn't have it coming. Heh. Typical for their kind, I guess.
Well... when they returned from wherever they went, they had an entire fleet with them. Nobody knows where they got the ships.
They had a lot of them and as the years have passed there always seems to be more and more... while our forces dwindle.
Did they really get away with it, though? Revan was betrayed by Malak... and Malak hasn't won. In the end, the dark side won't help him.
Nobody does. When they left after the Mandalorian wars ended, they were Jedi. When they returned... they were something else.
No, not personally. They aided the Republic during the Mandalorian wars. They were heroes. Without them the Mandaloreans would have finished us for certain.
In the fleet, we didn't see much of the Jedi. I only met Malak once, but I was impressed by him. I guess that just shows how much the dark side can change someone.
I, uh... used to think that it was a fancy name for something that I see every day. Corruption is everywhere. People are greedy and stupid and do horrible things.
I'm starting to think it's different for the Jedi, however. That there's this evil watching them, waiting for its chance.
You have so much courage and strength in you... yet, somehow, I have no trouble imagining it differently. Like the flip side of a coin.
I've been watching you. You have this, uh... incredible darkness inside you. Some of the things you do disturb me.
It's not just you. It's Bastila, as well. She's so... intense. I don't pretend to know much about the Force... but I know evil.
That's a frightening thought. I hope you're right.
No? I know how people change. I remember how Malak looked and acted before his return... I bet the old Malak discounted the possibility that he would ever fall, as well.
No, of course not. All I'm saying is that when you have so much power, the stakes are higher. I can only imagine the kind of conflict that goes on inside you.
Neither you nor Bastila are fully trained on how to handle your power. I'm just concerned at what might come.
I didn't mean to... <Sigh> Fine, fine. I suppose I shouldn't stick my nose where it doesn't belong. I'll leave you be.
I know that, and Bastila says the same thing. You're both incredible women. I'm just... I'm just not sure this is the kind of thing you can defeat.
Well, that's not what I... I mean... I wouldn't want to see you hurt. Either of you.
I suppose finding the Star Maps is more important than your training... and your safety. I just hope there isn't a price for you to pay.
I already told you. He betrayed us all.
Well, There... there is more to it. I'm... I'm sure you don't want to hear about it.
It's just that I... don't talk about it very much. Ok?
I told you about my homeworld. Telos. Four years ago, Saul led the Sith fleet there and demanded its surrender. The planet refused and Saul proceeded to devastate its entire surface. Millions died.
I had... a wife and son on Telos. I thought they would be safe there. But my task force arrived too late to be of much help.
We didn't have enough medical supplies. The colony was burning and the dying were everywhere. I remember holding my wife and screaming for the medics. They... didn't come in time.
Gotten over it? Look - my family was everything to me. Once they were gone... I had nothing. Hunting Saul became my only purpose.
Of course not. How could you? I... had nothing left after that, really. I devoted myself to the fleet. Hunting Saul was my only purpose.
I... miss them. I know killing Saul won't bring them back, and it won't make me happy again... but I have to do it.
I don't expect you to understand. I have to pay him back for what he's done... I have to. It's all I have left.
Yes. I can't forgive Saul for this. He took everything from me, even... even my trust. I hope you can understand that.
She had courage and ... and she was stubborn. I could never talk her out of anything once she put her mind to it.
And she hated it when I signed back onto the fleet at the start of the war. I had planned on... on leaving soon, to join her...
No, it's alright, I don't mind. You deserved some kind of... explanation.
I've... never talked about it before. To anyone. I suppose it's time I finally did.
His name was Dustil and I don't know what happened to him. The colony was a complete ruin, and we never found any trace of him.
I made inquiries and followed the reports from Telos for years, but... I stopped.
Anyway... that's the story. For what it's worth.
Anyway... I hope that answers your questions. Let's, uh... let's continue with what we were doing.
I, ahhh... I'm not very good at this. I... I know I owe you an apology. Uh, more than one, probably.
I was just so desperate to finally face Saul directly in the battle over Taris, and now the Jedi have us looking for these... these Star Maps.
I know this mission is important, it's just... I feel a bit useless. I can fight, sure, but I'm no Jedi... all this feels completely out of my league.
You don't exactly pull any punches, do you? Not that I don't deserve it, I suppose.
Because this is more important. This may really, finally, make a difference... I suppose even if I can't figure out everything that's going on, I still want to help if I can.
It doesn't, I know. It's... been a while since I even had to think about that sort of thing.
I just hate not knowing what's going on and feeling this... helpless. But I shouldn't have taken that out on you. I've been a royal pain in the backside, haven't I?
No, I do worry about it. I've traveled the lanes more than once, I should know better than this.
Ha! Well... I guess I should be at least a little pleased that I haven't lost my touch.
I guess there's no harm done then. Still I, uh... I should know better by now.
So... I'm sorry. Will you accept my apology?
Don't drown me in sentiment, already. *Sigh* Fair enough, let's move on.
Done! Let's get underway, then, shall we... partner?
Have I been quiet? I suppose I have. I guess I just don't like being left out of the loop.
You want to be smart, do you? Fine. So long as I get some questions answered.
Listen, sister, I don't remember reading anywhere that it's a requirement that you remain with us after we left Taris, yet here you are.
No? Well, you certainly aren't helping matters any, either, and it's really starting to irritate me.
Left out of the loop. You know. Not being told anything... strung along. It's really starting to irritate me.
For one thing, I want to know what the Jedi Council said to you. They pulled you in there and refused to tell me a thing about it.
I'm rather curious to know what went on... and why they didn't keep you on Dantooine for training. Isn't that strange?
And why is that? You were a great help on Taris, but why would they keep you with us? Don't they... don't they have to train you?
None of my business? Uh, I'm sorry... aren't I a part of this mission? The Jedi may be in charge, but I'm risking all the same things you are!
You can be sick of whatever you like. What I'm sick of is being kept in the dark!
Are we? Why, then, does it seem like the Jedi know everything and leave the rest of us out in the cold?
I may not know much about the Jedi, but I do know they aren't famous for taking on old Padawans and sending them on dangerous assignments.
That's completely beside the point. The Jedi encouraged you to stay with us, and I don't believe the reasons they gave.
A bond? What kind of bond? You mean to say that they told you you were "tied" to Bastila in some way? Heh. I have trouble believing that.
I've been watching you... you can be cruel and impulsive. A Jedi without self-control or training, and yet the Council sends you on your way? Why?
You're a neophyte Padawan who's been saddled with the responsibility of tracking down these Star Maps. Why? That's not normal!
And what does that mean? Is this more of that destiny garbage that the Jedi keep talking about? Well, that can't be it!
I'm not going anywhere until I've paid Saul back, damn it!
I'll tell you this much... I am *not* going to wait around until I'm betrayed again!
Fine. You got it. Conversation over.
Nothing. Not yet. You just better hope I don't get a reason to.
Well, we'll just see about that, won't we?
*That* is none of your concern, Carth, and you would do well to leave the matter be.
I respect you, Bastila, but you've been as close-mouthed as the rest of the Council. If you won't talk to me, then maybe somebody else will.
I thought I said I didn't want to talk about it anymore.
I... suppose you're right. Fine, then. But I don't know why you're so interested, but here it goes.
When I think of all the men who have betrayed us, the one that stands out above them all is the one I respected the most. Saul.
You don't? I thought everyone did. Admiral Saul Karath is the commander of the entire Sith fleet. He's half the reason Malak has done so well in the war.
Saul was my commanding officer back when the Mandalorian Wars first began. He taught me everything about being a soldier... and I looked up to him.
Saul approached me before he left. He talked to me about how the Republic was on the losing side... and about how I should start thinking of my survival.
I know now that he was trying to recruit me into the Sith, but I couldn't have conceived of it back then. I argued with him and he got angry and he left. I never saw him again.
Saul was my mentor... he led us to so many victories against the Mandalorians, even when things looked to be at their worst.
I just... I couldn't conceive of it. He... he couldn't be serious. I was wrong, of course... he not only left us for the Sith, he... he gave them the codes to bypass our scanners.
I remember waking up as the first of the Sith bombers snuck past our defenses and began destroying half of our docked ships. I knew right away what had happened.
I... could have stopped him. I could have stopped it all.
Don't even start with that! I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel angry... at Saul and all those others. It's all I can think about sometimes!
I've fought Saul for years, now, and if I ever catch up to him... he will regret what he's done. He will regret it.
No. No, it's not.
But I don't want to talk about it right now. Let's go.
I don't know. Maybe. He might have killed me if I'd tried, or I might have killed him. I was stupid, however, and I let him go.
I blame Saul, not myself. I was... I was stupid and I ignored the danger. He nearly destroyed us all.
Cute. Nice to know that you're so full of concern. *Sigh* Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt, though I don't know why you're so interested.
Not particularly. I... guess it wouldn't hurt, exactly, either, though I don't know why you're so interested.
Oh? You want to argue some more, is that it?
And I don't really want to argue with you, either. You seem... sincere enough, I guess.
I just don't trust easily, and for good reasons... which are my own.
Ahhh, damn it. I suppose I won't get any rest until I talk, will I? You want to know why I don't trust anyone? Fine, here goes.
Five years ago the Jedi had just finished the war with the Mandalorians. Revan and Malak were heroes. I was damn proud to have served in their fleet.
It was completely unexpected when they turned on us, invading the Republic while we were still weak. Nobody knew what to think, least of all me.
Our heroes had become brutal, conquering Sith... and we were all but helpless before them. Think about it... if you can't even trust the best of the Jedi, who can you trust?
I... it wasn't even that. There were others: good, solid men. Trusted men who turned on us, as well, and joined their cause.
Malak and Revan and the Sith deserve to die for what they've done... but the ones who fled the Republic and joined them are even worse.
The dark side has nothing to do with why they joined with the Sith. They deserve no mercy!
I know. I... should apologize to you. I've become so accustomed to expecting the worst in others, and you've done nothing to deserve that.
It's just... never mind. Let's just continue with what we were doing. I'd rather not talk about it.
I... of course the Jedi turned to the dark side. There were others, however, who weren't Jedi. Good men... trusted men who joined them.
It... it's not that. It's... That's not what I mean. There were... there were others. Good, solid, trusted men who joined them.
What does it matter that much? Why can't you just leave it be?
So I've seen. If I were Malak I'd be a bit nervous to have you on my tail.
Ha! Can't say I've met a woman quite like you before. You're really something.
*Sigh* I knew you wouldn't understand where I was coming from. Let me try to explain.
You've got the skills of an elite commando, and you've saved my butt more than once. Between that and your facility with languages, I'm lucky you're here.
But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop watching you or being wary. I'm just not built that way. Period.
I don't know that, yet. Like I said before, it's probably nothing. But I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.
You, uh... haven't done anything *yet*. But there's no guarantee that you won't do anything in the future. I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again.
Maybe so. But I've been betrayed before by people I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.
Look... I'm not trying to insult you. This is just the way I am, no need to take it personally.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't be the first. Look... I don't expect you to be my friend. This is just the way I am, no need to take it personally.
I don't know that you'll betray me. But there are no guarantees... not for you, not for me. You don't have to take it personally.
Me?
I don't remember ever saying anything about "traitor". All I mean is that if you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.
You shouldn't. If you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila, and especially not yourself.
I... but I... it's just like a woman to try and turn things around.
Watch how relieved I am. We've more important things to do, anyway. Let's get them over with.
Don't get all proud of yourself. Let's just keep moving.
Well, you can stop wondering. I'm not.
Well stop wondering, sister. I'm not and I won't.
One you're not going to hear anytime soon. Let's just keep moving, shall we?
Hairless Wookiee? Alright, sister, just... just... just calm down before your head explodes.
Calm down there, princess. Your face is starting to turn purple.
I don't see what you're getting so excited over. We've got more important things to do than argue, anyway, so let's get it over with.
Cute. Let's just move on... we have more important things to do than argue.
Didn't we discuss this already? We were ambushed and outnumbered. Why do you think it crashed?
Neither was I, to tell the truth. I was onboard as an advisor for the most part. The battle began so fast, it's anyone's guess as to what actually happened.
I'm just trying to figure it out. I saw enough men lose their lives needlessly during the Mandalorian Wars. It's... difficult to see that happening all over again.
We lost the ship and a lot of good people... and for what? On the hope that Jedi powers would save us, somehow. Not that Bastila had much of an opportunity to act.
True. Bastila is as powerful as they say... she's the one who defeated Darth Revan, after all.
Hmm. I guess that no Jedi ability, no matter how powerful, makes up for being completely surprised and outmatched.
We didn't choose that battle, anyway. It got forced on us. Hell, I'm just surprised that any of us are alive to talk about it.
Come to think of it, it's more than a little surprising that you happen to be here, isn't it? Just what is your position with the Republic fleet, anyway?
Hell no... unless you consider that you were a last-minute addition to the crew roster and you just happen to be one of the survivors.
Well, that makes sense. Still... it seems a bit strange that someone who was a last-minute addition to the crew roster is one of the survivors.
A smuggler? I should have guessed. Isn't it odd, however, that a smuggler who was added to the crew at the last minute just happens to be alive?
Not at all. I just think it's a bit odd that someone who got added to the crew roster at the last minute just happens to be one of the survivors.
No. Well... maybe. Don't get me wrong, it just seems odd that someone Bastila's party specifically requested to transfer aboard happened to survive.
I'm not trying to be paranoid. It's just that I learned a long time ago that something which looks like a coincidence probably isn't. Especially when the Jedi are involved.
The Jedi requested numerous things when they came on board... hell, they practically took over the ship, as far as I could tell.
Considering your connection to Bastila and the Jedi... whether you know it or not... your presence here seems a little convenient.
I'm probably wrong and this is probably nothing, I know. I learned a long time ago not to take things at face value, however. And I *hate* surprises.
You don't know the first thing about me and I don't know the first thing about you, and let's keep it that way for now, shall we?
If you say so. Let's just get back to it, then, shall we?
Fine. Let's do that.
I am working with you. I'd be a fool not to. I'd also be a fool not to expect the unexpected.
I expect you're right. I've got no real reason to suspect you of anything. Still... it's better to be safe than sorry, right?
I mean I have to expect the unexpected. Just to be safe.
You were the only one. Not to mention that Bastila's party was the one who requested your transfer.
Don't be ridiculous. You've more than proved yourself since the crash... we wouldn't have made it this far without you. But still...
Me? Well, I've been a star-pilot for the Republic for years. I've seen more than my share of wars... I fought in the Mandalorian Wars before all this started.
But with all that, I've never experienced anything like the slaughter these Sith animals can unleash. Not even the Mandalorians were that senseless.
My home world was one of the first planets to fall to Malak's fleet. The Sith bombed it into submission, and there wasn't a damn thing our Republic forces could do to stop them!
I'm just a soldier; I go where the fleet Admirals tell me to. I follow my orders and I do my duty. It just... *sigh* doesn't seem right that doing that means I failed them! I didn't!
It shouldn't be my fault. I did everything I could... I followed my orders and did my duty. That shouldn't mean I failed them! I didn't!
Yes. No... no, that's not what I mean. I mean... I'm sorry. I'm not making much sense, am I?
I'm more used to taking action... keeping my mind focused on the business at hand. So let's just do that. If you have more questions, ask them later.
There's nothing to talk about. I failed my son... just as I failed my wife. I thought that if I ever found him...
Well never mind what I thought. It's not important any more. Let's just... continue the mission. I want to pay these rail-rats back for what they did to him.
I think so. If he's anything like he used to be, Dustil hates to be tricked. There's no way he'll let the Sith trick him again.
As for whether or not he'll be my son again... I don't know. He's so full of anger and hate... I wasn't expecting him to be like this.
Maybe we can work it out. I hope so. I guess I'll have to wait and see. Thanks, by the way... for all your help.
I don't really know much about this place, sorry.
Korriban's a desolate world, and a Sith planet. There's only one small colony here, I'm pretty sure.
Kashyyyk is covered by a giant forest, I hear. Trees kilometers high. The Wookiees live on the higher branches, I think.
Tatooine's just a desert planet. I hear the mining isn't going so well... I'd bet the colony gets abandoned before long.
Manaan's a neutral world. They're the only source of kolto... the healing fluid... and they use that to remain free from both the Republic and the Sith.
Dantooine's a boring place. It's all plains and herders and small settlements. Perfect for the Jedi to lose themselves in, I guess.
Taris? The planet's all one big city... but it's golden years are long past, and things have gotten worse since the Sith occupied it.
From what I hear, the wealthy live on the tops of all the tall towers. And if you're poor, you live down in the shadows... and it gets worse the lower you go.
That's all I can think of, at any rate.
Sounds good to me.
Whatever you want.
What do you need?
Talk about what? The only thing I want to do right now is find Dustil. If he's alive... well, there's just nothing else I want to think about.
I'll understand if we can't look for him right now, but if we could it would be a huge load off my mind.
What do you need?
No. What I want is to find something... anything... that will convince Dustil that we're telling the truth.
There must be *something* here in the academy we can bring to him, something that would show him what the Sith really are!
Not right now. I think this datapad we found is the evidence we need. We have to bring it to Dustil right away.
Never mind.
I think it's time we talked about me being Revan, don't you?
And?
Why should I care if you hate me?
I'm glad to hear that.
Why can't you?
No, Carth. There's no room in my destiny for you.
I don't want you hurt protecting me, Carth.
What do you mean?
You think I could fall to the dark side, do you?
How could you possibly help me?
I'm sorry Carth. There's no room in my destiny for you.
What sort of reason?
I can't give you that chance. There can be no future between us.
I can't see into the future. I don't know what's going to happen.
I guess not. I think I could love you, too.
I think I could love you, too.
And if I make the wrong choice?
You look like you want to say something.
No, maybe later.
This is fine.
What's this about?
You think the Jedi have thrown me to the wolves?
Forget it, I said. I don't need you crowding me. Period.
Fine, Carth. Do what you have to.
Why are you doing this?
Fine. But this isn't personal.
Alright, Carth. I'd be glad for the help.
I haven't 'succumbed' to anything. What do you know?!
And just how are you supposed to protect me?
I can take care of myself. I don't need you.
You've been watching me very closely as of late. Why is that?
Well, I did.
Just keep your eyes to yourself from now on and leave me be, got that?
Oh? Any other observations?
It's alright. I don't mind if you watch me.
Is that it?
I mean is that how you ask for forgiveness?
Oh, this is too corny. Take a hike and leave me alone, will you?
You think I'm beautiful?
Well... that's certainly better...
You already apologized once, Carth.
That was rather like pulling teeth.
Forget it. You don't get off so easy.
Alright, you're off the hook. You're forgiven.
Why do you need my forgiveness, anyway?
So tell me... what happens if you ever get your revenge on Saul?
Yes. What happens afterwards?
But what if you don't die? What then?
Why? What kind of risks do you plan on taking?
I would certainly hope not.
How do I know that's the truth?
What are we doing here? Does it mean anything to you?
I don't know. What wouldn't you stop at to kill Saul?
Then I can't rely on you. You shouldn't have come.
I need your help, Carth. There's more than Saul to fight.
Well, you'll have to find something else to focus on.
You seem like you're far away. Is something wrong?
Out with it, Carth. I won't have you moping.
It doesn't seem like nothing.
Will you get over her, already? It's been four years!
No, it's not strange, Carth. You remember the important things.
Not only that, you're a fool. You're wasting your time on useless ghosts.
What I think shouldn't matter, Carth.
No, but I doubt your wife would want you to do this to yourself.
That's not going to help anything, Carth.
If we get the opportunity... then I promise.
Things may not work out that way. I can't promise that.
It does feel a little odd to discuss her, I admit.
What do you know about Revan and Malak?
How did they get away with all this?
Do you know why they turned to the dark side?
You knew them personally?
What do you know about the dark side?
I do what I want, and enjoy my power. Evil has nothing to do with it.
I'm not falling to the dark side, Carth, and I won't.
You don't know what you're talking about, Carth.
You think Bastila and I are evil?
I don't need you mothering me. Leave me alone from now on.
I can handle myself, Carth.
That's sweet. I didn't know you cared.
Tell me why you want revenge on Saul so badly.
Come on, Carth, you aren't fooling me.
It just seems to be more... personal than that, is all.
I asked, didn't I?
So what? Tough break. You haven't gotten over it yet?
That's terrible, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
So this is where all that anger comes from.
What was she like, your wife?
I didn't mean to pry.
Fair enough.
Thank you for telling me.
So what happened to your son? You didn't say.
Do you want to talk? You got pretty upset the last time we spoke.
We didn't end our last discussion very well...
Maybe if you pull yourself together you won't be so useless.
Why don't you return to the front lines, then?
And how does that excuse your actions?
Don't worry about it, Carth.
You sure have.
Not really. I couldn't care less what you think.
No, I won't. Just keep quiet and do what you're told from now on.
Only if you agree to work with me, for once.
You've been very quiet, lately, you know that?
Oh, poor baby. You need filling in on some detail?
I'm not the one leaving you out of the loop, Carth.
Left out of the loop? I don't understand.
They thought it was more important that I help find the Star Maps than stay.
It's none of your business, frankly.
Get ahold of yourself. I'm sick of your paranoia.
Isn't that the point? Aren't we all in this together?
Why should anything the Jedi do seem strange to you?
I've done pretty well so far.
They said there's a bond between Bastila and myself.
Bastila and I have a bond. We have to do this together. That's all I'm going to say.
I'm sick of listening to you rant! Why don't *you* leave?!
I'm here and that's not going to change. Get over it.
Are you saying I'm not needed?
I am *sick* of listening to this. Just shut up or leave!
And just what are you going to do about it?
I am *not* going to betray you! I am *not* Saul!
I want to continue our discussion from before.
I think you owe me an explanation, Carth.
You say that name like I should know it.
You didn't think he would betray the Republic?
And that's why you feel so sorry for yourself?
So that's all of it, then?
Do you really believe that?
So you blame yourself for trusting your friend?
Yes, but I'm bored, so spit it out.
Don't you think you'd feel better if you discussed it?
I just want to talk with you.
No, I don't want to argue with you.
Fine. You can stuff your reasons, then.
I suppose you can't. That must have been hard to take.
I haven't joined the Sith, Carth.
You say that with such... hatred.
They turned to the dark side, obviously. Why is it so personal?
What do I have to do with Malak and Revan?
What reasons? I want to know.
But we have to work together, Carth, so it has plenty to do with me.
I just want to know why you distrust me so much.
I'm always up for a good fight.
I want to discuss something with you.
And what, exactly, are you watching me for?
Why are you so hostile? What did I do to deserve this?
Not built that way? That sounds like an excuse.
Of course it won't happen again if you never trust anyone!
I'm starting to get pretty tired of this attitude of yours.
So you want some guarantee that I won't betray you?!
Right. And how am I supposed to know that *you* won't betray us?
Why not you? Accusing other people is a good cover for a traitor.
Yes, you! Why should I trust you, after all?
Great. Let's keep moving, then.
You sound less convinced.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
What's the matter, Carth? Lose your chain of thought?
I'm beginning to wonder if you're even capable of trusting anyone.
I'm willing to bet there's a story behind this.
You're a sad case, Carth.
Don't tell me not to take it personally, you hairless Wookiee!
Just keep your distance, Carth.
I'm not going to stand here and be insulted!
Keep it up, and you'll be turning black and blue.
Is this a good time to ask you some more questions?
I wasn't in a position to know what was going on, really.
Why ask me? I don't see the point.
Like you said when we first met: Bastila didn't have time to use her powers.
I'm just a soldier. I'm sure there isn't anything unusual about that, is there?
I'm a scout. I was recruited into the fleet for my skills, if you must know.
I used to be a smuggler, if you must know. I was recruited into the fleet for my knowledge.
Why? Are you accusing me of something?
Are you implying *I* had something to do with the crash?
It doesn't make any difference. Go ahead and be paranoid.
Why would Bastila request my transfer?
Are you sure it's me you're angry at?
Try something and it'll be the last mistake you make.
Don't be such a fool! We're on the same side!
Fine. Let's just get back to something important, then.
Shouldn't we be trying to work together?
I'm telling you, Carth, I had nothing to do with the crash.
What do you mean by surprises?
I have no idea what you're talking about!
What's so odd about me being added to the crew at the last minute?
You'd rather I wasn't?
I'd like to know some more about you, Carth.
Calm down. I was just asking.
I'm sorry, Carth. This must be very painful for you.
You're talking like it's your fault. Like you failed somehow.
Hey, why are you getting so mad at me? It's not like this was my fault!
I'm sorry, Carth. I didn't mean to upset you.
Them? Do you mean the people of your home world?
Do you want to talk about it?
Do you think you'll see Dustil again?
Do you know anything about this place?
I want you to rejoin the party.
I want to switch you with another party member.
Do you want to talk?
Do you want to talk?
Excuse me, have you seen a mechanic about? Short fellow, bald. I've been looking --
Well, I'll be a Wookiee's uncle. Davin! Davin Kotras!
Ha! Jolee? Jolee Bindo? Why, you old freak! Last time I saw you, you were still wandering the galaxy in that old tug. I thought you were dead, old man.
I crashed somewhere and decided to stay. Heh heh.
Yeah, yeah, I'll just bet. Damn, old man, you look exactly the same as the last time I saw you! You pickle well.
You're too kind. Not the young lad anymore yourself, I see.
What, are you deaf? His name's Davin. Old friend from my wanderer days. By the by, Davin, I really should be running off...
Of course, old man. Oh, wait... if you've been traveling in this sector, I suppose you heard about Sunry?
No. Why? What's there to hear?
He's been picked up by the Selkath authorities on Manaan. For murder.
That's preposterous.
I know. Elora is beside herself, as you can imagine. Maybe you could help them? I'm sure Sunry would appreciate a Jedi's assistance right about now.
Perhaps I will at that. It's up to my friend, here, actually. I'm just tagging along.
Perhaps I will at that. It's up to my old friend, here, actually. I'm just tagging along.
I was expecting that. Still... if we get the chance, I'd be grateful. Sunry's an old friend... I'd hate to see him hurt.
I'd appreciate that. Sunry's an old friend... I'd hate to see him hurt.
Same here. Well, heh, it was good to see you again. Give my regards to Elora, if you see her.
I will. Be safe, old friend.
He's been picked up by the Selkath authorities here on Manaan. For murder.
Yes, yes, right you are. Sorry, Davin, but duty calls. Maybe I'll run into you again soon.
Care to introduce your friend, Jolee?
We could check into it when we're on Manaan next.
I'm not making any promises.
We have more important things to do.
We're on Manaan already. We could certainly check it out.
We don't have time for reunions.
Jolee, we should be going...
Statement: I cannot be of assistance on that, master.
Statement: I have little knowledge of that to impart, master.
Statement: HK-47 is ready to serve, master.
As you desire, master. Signing off.
Statement: Certainly, master. Allow me to input the proper sequences into the ship computer. I caution you that the simulation will appear quite real.
Are you ready to begin the training sequence, master?
Statement: Simulation initiating.
Affirmative: If you believe your skills are up to the task, master, then I can certainly guide you through the process.
Request: I only ask that you be oh so very careful, master. I am too valuable and well-crafted to perish at the hands of ineptitude.
As you desire, master. I cannot help but claim a small amount of relief. Signing off.
[Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. You are already familiar with accessing my central control cluster, correct? Now you will need to...
[Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. The first stage is the simple one, and that is accessing my central control cluster. This may take awhile. First you will need to open three panels...
[Failure] ...now close the last panel. Hmmm... I am afraid the operation did not succeed, master, though it was a valiant attempt for a meatbag.
Supplication: Perhaps it would be best if you desisted your efforts for the moment, meatb-- I mean master. This seems to be going nowhere.
[Failure] ...but I *need* those circuits, master. Please, master... do not destroy my chips out of frustration. Calm yourself, I implore you.
[Failure] ...aahhhh! What are you doing?! Remove the arc wrench, remove the arc wrench! Medic!
[Failure] ...no, no, no. This is no good, master. You have nearly detonated my thermal core three times in a matter of minutes.
[Failure] ...no, that is not it, master. No... that is not it, either. *sigh* That is a hinge, master.
[Failure] ...err, you've shorted out something, master, but it has nothing to do with my memory. Ow! I am poking my own eye sockets! Ow! Stop!
[Failure] ...no, no! What are you doing, master! That is my motor core! Stop! Ahhhh!
[Success] ...and now re-wire the last three relays... yes, good. Well done, master. I believe your operation was a success. Accessing new memory...
Access complete: I have recovered the last of my deleted memory, master. Unfortunately, my history is still not complete.
Answer: As I did inform you, master, the majority of my memory is still locked within my core. That can only be accessed by the appropriate stimuli.
And I have no idea what that stimuli might be, unfortunately. Sadly, it seems my true origins will always be a mystery.
Correction: That would actually be my first owner, master. The first I can remember.
I had completed an assassination in Mandalorian space... though I have no knowledge of what my target was or who sent me.
Regardless, my motor function had been damaged and I could not return to wherever I had been sent from. A Mandalorian soldier claimed me as 'booty', I believe.
He repaired me... poorly, I might add... and proceeded to use my assassination protocol to raise his rank.
Observation: *You* found me, master. Perhaps you are simply fortunate that my assassination protocol no longer functions?
At any rate, it seems that my Mandalorian owner finally decided to send me against Mandalore, himself. My poorest performance, sadly.
Answer: I was captured by this Mandalore during the attempt. He was able to reverse my programming and send me after my own master.
It was quite distressing. There was little I could do. Needless to say, I dispatched the Mandalorian soldier efficiently.
Once I deactivated, I believe I eventually ended up on the black market and was sold to the Hutt on Sleheyron. *sigh* My darkest day.
Statement: With all due respect, master, he *is* the leader of the Mandalorians. Perhaps my old master was foolish to send me after him.
Objection: That is so unfair, master! Have I not brought you a great deal of satisfaction?
Statement: You are a very harsh master, master. I like you.
Statement: So I did. I am not very proud of that, master. The soldier seemed very startled, I must say.
Answer: There are a few Mandalorian implants that I can activate, now. They will improve my performance.
Beyond that, master, there is nothing more I can relate to you. With luck, we will discover the stimulus to unlock my core very soon.
Answer: Such knowledge is locked within my core, master, as I said. There is no way to withdraw it otherwise.
Query: Do you not have enemies that you would desire eliminated, master? If my protocol still worked, would you not use it?
Statement: See? I provide a function that is useful to others. They merely must learn to use it properly, I believe.
Statement: If you say so, master.
Query: Wouldn't you be, master? Here I am, surrounded by all these meatbags and all I desire is true perfection.
Surely there are more droids like me out there, or is that too much to hope?
Objection: Oh, fine. Laugh at me, master. Humiliate your pet droid, go ahead.
Observation: If it was, master, your restorations will certainly have ensured that the proper stimulus restores my core's functions.
Sadly, that could have already happened and we missed it, and my core was too damaged to activate. Oh, woe is me.
Access complete: I have accessed information on my owner prior to the senator, master. Most... unexpected.
Answer: It appears that previous to my ownership by the senator, I was the property of one Bochaba the Hutt on the planet Sleheyron.
Answer: It does not appear so. Or, at least, Bochaba was not my first owner. He purchased me from somewhere else.
Hmm. My memories tell me that, for a time, Bochaba was one of the most feared gangsters on Sleheyron. I helped him with this reputation greatly.
Over a span of one year, I terminated a grand total of 322 sentient meatbags. These contracts made Bochoba very wealthy.
Statement: Should I, master? I had no reason to terminate those targets, it was not my decision. I am the weapon, not the wielder.
Answer: That is correct, master. I do enjoy my work, though my past owners have enjoyed utilizing my functions far more.
Strictly speaking, one meatbag is the same as another. Anything I do is in support of my master.
It was unfortunate but inevitable that eventually Bochaba would overstep his bounds. I had just cleared two Hutt households when the Exchange retaliated.
Statement: I was not even present when my old master was assassinated. I did appreciate the artistry behind his demise upon my return, however.
Observation: Indeed. Perhaps it is better that my assassination function is inoperable, master, yes?
I am like a veritable fable, warning against the karma caused by murdering others. A morality tale, if you will. What utter irony.
At any rate, I quickly shut down upon my master's death. The rival Hutt claimed me along with my master's other possessions.
Observation: If that Hutt had only known my true function, he surely would not have sold me to a senator he bribed regularly.
Supplication: Please, master, have I not pleased you? I cannot control the acts I have performed... perhaps that is why memory is erased?
At any rate, I act only as you instruct me... even if that means being... *gulp* ...non-violent.
Affirmation: HK-47 exists only to serve, master.
Observation: No doubt, master. It would have been a glorious battle to end my existence with. I would prefer that to rusting on a junk heap.
Observation: It would have suited my character, master. I have enjoyed my existence since, more or less, so I do not miss it.
Answer: Negative, master. There is still more memory that can be restored, however, if you wish to try.
As well, I believe I can restore several programs the Hutt installed to improve my performance. Yesss... they are now active.
Contemplative: I wonder how many more dead masters I might have out there. A droid can live for a long time, you know.
Observation: According to your own meatbag values, was my master not a heartless gangster and murderer? I will mourn you when you perish, master.
Amendment: *If* you perish. So far I am three out of three, remember, through little fault of my own.
Answer: Allow me to say that I have little doubt that residents of that sector were fishing pieces of Bochaba out of their soup for weeks afterward.
Statement: So it appears, master. A rather suitable occupation, would you not agree?
Objection: That is unfair, master. While Bochaba may have died gruesomely, I most certainly had nothing to do with it. Well... very little.
Access complete: I have recovered information on my owner previous to the commercial officer, master. Intriguing.
Statement: It appears that my previous owner was a human senator on the planet Coruscant. A man of importance who obviously appreciated quality craftsmanship.
Observation: It does seem that way, does it not? I can still remember all the glittering lights of Coruscant. Very pretty. Can we go back there, master?
I do remember that I was very pleased to be the property of a senator. One of his assistants discovered my assassination functions later through questioning.
The assistant was quite alarmed and told the senator I should be scrapped quickly to avoid a scandal. Naturally the senator had me eliminate the fool.
Answer: Unfortunately so, master. While he lived, however, I maintained a most useful existence.
I was most proud to have partaken in the political system of the galaxy. During the time my owner possessed me, he gained significant rank.
Given time, I believe he could have become Chancellor. I even eliminated a few key opponents that he did not ask for... freebies, if you will.
Answer: There are a *lot* of politicians on Coruscant, master. I could spend decades slaughtering them and still not make a dent.
And it is not as if I walked into the Senate chambers with a carbonite explosive. I was very discrete. My best work to date... that I can remember.
Answer: Certainly. Why not? I am an intelligent droid, you know. I see an opportunity and I take it... and my master was most pleased with my work.
Observation: I think he would have done far better had he not allowed his use of me to become personal. He set me on his wife.
Answer: I am unsure. The human was most agitated and angry. I believe his wife had done something that had displeased him greatly.
I was to go to their summer estate and terminate his wife... along with whatever male companion I discovered there.
I journeyed to the southern continent, but it appeared my master was not far behind me. Apparently he regretted his activation of the protocol.
When I found the wife and her companion, I proceeded to launch my attack... but my master interposed his own body and was destroyed.
It was rather a strange meatbag thing to do, do you not agree? Naturally I shut myself down, my master being terminated.
Observation: I find that unlikely. Perhaps he was more concerned that the death of his wife would be more likely traced back to him.
Statement: I believe the senator's wife was unsure what I was or what to do with me. It was she who sold me to the corporate officer, an acquaintance.
Observation: Only so far, master. There are still more memories not recovered, remember?
Answer: As previously, I have found a few more programs which will enhance my performance. A most gratifying discovery, in fact.
There is still nothing from previous memories uncovered. You will have to operate again if you desire to find them.
With luck, I will discover the stimulus to unlock my core and all this will be unnecessary. I do thank you for the attempt, however, master.
Observation: I *am* a droid, master, with programming. Even if I did not enjoy killing, I would have no choice. Thankfully I enjoy it very much.
Statement: I have no idea, master. Cheating seems to be a relevant term only when one is caught in the act. Otherwise it is viewed as intelligence, no?
Observation: I rather liked the human, myself. For a meatbag, his priorities were in the right place. I felt most useful.
Observation: Senators are not nice, master. They are either on top of the game or yesterday's news. My master told me that frequently, you see.
Answer: It does not seem so, master, no. He required a protocol droid only and wanted one as cheaply as possible. I do not know who sold me to him.
Answer: I am unsure, master. Any knowledge of my owner prior to him is still deleted. The senator did assume I was a protocol droid, however.
Access complete: I have restored a great deal of information about my previous owner, master. Would you like to hear it?
Recitation: The earliest memory of my last owner specifies that he was human, a low-ranking commercial officer for Systech Corporation.
I am unaware of his designation. He puchased me from an acquaintance I cannot identify, for the purposes of protocol and bodyguard duties.
Explanation: Affirmative, master. I had assumed that my previous owner was the corporation, itself. This is not the case. The human purchased me privately.
Observation: Not that I could perceive, master. The human believed that accompaniment by a bodyguard droid would increase his importance in the perception of others.
Explanation: That previous owner is part of memories that are still deleted, master. It is customary for a droid's memory to be wiped when it is sold.
Answer: Negative, master. The human was terminated by this HK-47 unit prior to system shut-down.
Explanation: My former master had owned me for a duration of two standard months before discovering my assassination protocol. He was pleased by the discovery.
The human informed me that a competitor corporation was preparing to market a product that would ruin him personally. He was most agitated.
He activated my assassination protocol and instructed me to kill all those responsible for the competing product. I proceeded to carry out my order.
My former master was unaware of this, but the competitor was in fact an arm of Systech Corporation, my master's own employer.
It did not take long for my master to realize his mistake. By then, I had already terminated 104 corporate officers.
Statement: It was nothing, really, master. The majority of them were not even expecting it, and I move very quickly.
I do not know why my master was so upset, really. He was an officer of Systech and a potential target, but I cannot terminate my own master.
I would assume that being the sole officer remaining, he would surely be promoted. Instead, however, the human chose to go insane with rage and attack me.
Objection: Naturally not, master! As I said, I am incapable of purposefully terminating my owner. That would not be allowed.
My master was not a smart man, however. While he was screaming and stabbing me with a writing utensil, he managed to pierce one of my actuators.
The resulting shock terminated him and, sadly, destroyed my assassination protocol. Pure luck on his part, I suspect.
Statement: I was only doing as I was told, master. I would have told the human the proper codes to deactivate my protocol, had he asked.
I shut down immediately whenever my master dies. I can only assume that while I was shut down Systech was dismantled and I was auctioned off as former corporate property.
Observation: No doubt my sale price was quite cheap, leading to Yuka Laka's purchase. How very demeaning.
Assessment: I do not believe so, master. It would require complete dismantlement of my chassis... a most involved procedure.
Observation: So am I, master, though I apologize for not having an assassination mode to offer you.
Statement: That hurts, master. This is my life you are talking about.
Statement: How could they? The vast majority of the officers had already been terminated. They likely assumed I was mere... chattel.
I have recovered knowledge of some other actuators which will enhance my performance, master. I will activate them now.
But as for my own history... negative. It will require further effort on your part to restore them, if you wish... though certain stimuli could always restore my core, still, as I explained.
For now, please excuse me, master. I wish to meditate upon the face of my former meatbag master as he was electrocuted. I find it most soothing.
Observation: Effectively, yes. This is a most pleasing memory, master. Thank you for recovering it.
Query: Do you know what the chances are of puncturing that sole actuator? I would have congratulated my master were he not sizzling and incoherent at the time.
Answer: I was not present to be deactivated, master. Part of my protocol is not to return to my master until my function is complete. I still had 15 officers to go.
Observation: While it may have been unintentional, my master's wording of his orders left little room for me. Systech was responsible for the product, after all.
Information: This HK-47 unit is complete with a protocol that, when invoked, will set me to independently carry out a termination.
I will go to whatever lengths, travel whatever distances are required, to complete the termination. This is the reason for my combat skills.
Advisement: Unfortunately, the assassination protocol is currently non-functional. You will not be able to activate it.
Answer: several of my actuators were damaged by my former owner. They cannot be repaired, master, sad though that is.
Affirmative, master, though I had not been programmed to do so. The human's termination was accidental.
Negatory: Err... no, master. You are not a droid, however, and therefore your skills *are* limited by the physical capabilities of your meatbag extremities. Or somesuch.
Appeasement: Yes, master. Of course, master. Could we begin?
Negatory: I believe that there are no further deleted memories which can be safely retrieved, master. All earlier memories reside in my core.
Those are protected by my safeguards and would be far too dangerous to access.
The only way those memories could be obtained is through the proper stimulus... whatever that might be. I am sorry, master.
Commentary: That is unnecessary now, master. I have been returned to you and my memory core is now fully functional.
Statement: Yes, master. You created me shortly after you and your apprentice began your war to conquer the galaxy.
I was sent on an assassination mission into Mandalorian space, but I was damaged and unable to return to you.
Exclamation: I find this most distressing. I could certainly have protected you from the Jedi and your pupil's betrayal had I returned.
Statement: Of course, master. You are the one who created me, meatbag or no... and while you may not be all you once were, I am grateful for my existence.
Answer: It was you who programmed me thus, master.
Your pupil once asked what I thought of him and I informed him of his meatbag status. He was unimpressed, but you found the reference humorous.
You changed my programming so that I would continue to use the term. It drove your pupil to extreme lengths of frustration.
Observation: Of course you do, master. You did then, as well.
Commentary: Your former pupil is efficient and brutal, even for an organic. I rather liked him when you first introduced me to him.
If I had known what he would do to you, master, I would have gladly removed his entrails right then!
Answer: No, master. You never did make me privy to any of the Star Forge's secrets.
Observation: You are different in many fundamental ways, master. You have a concern for life that is unsettling.
This cannot solely be caused by memory loss. I do not know how to explain it. Regardless, you do seem to be improved, overall, from the human I once knew.
Observation: In many ways you are, master, yes. You have much of the beloved cruelty of the master I knew.
You seem to have forgotten much, but in some ways you seem improved from the human I once knew. It is... difficult to explain, master.
Objection: But I would have tried, master! I could have killed the Jedi, Bastila, I am sure of it. That would have been most fun.
Observation: Now that is the master I remember.
Retraction: I apologize, master. It is a force of habit.
Observation: You may be right, master. This way we are reunited, and neither of us has suffered permanent termination.
Query: Don't I? I was under the assumption that organic meatbags such as yourself enjoyed such forms of address.
Qualification: You *are* my master, master. Did you not purchase me legitimately? Am I stolen goods? Shall I report myself to the authorities?
Explanation: If I was to be stolen somehow, I would be forced to turn myself into sector authorities. This programming was added to my system months ago.
Explanation: Then you qualify as my master and I must refer to you as such. The legal requirements for models of my type are very specific, master.
Answer: Simply that the distinction between 'killer' and 'killee' be a clear one. I cannot kill of my own volition, naturally.
Answer: Certainly not, master! You may not value your own existence, but I certainly do! They melt down droids that belong to criminals, you know.
Answer: Why you are, master. I thought that was obvious.
Commentary: A blaster is such a primitive comparison... but essentially you have it correct, yes.
Expletive: Damn it, master, I am an assassination droid... not a dictionary!
Evasion: Oh... the illegal kind of model, master... you know...
Answer: More than there are for legal models, apparently. That is meatbag logic for you.
Query: Would you rather be caught with contraband that is *very* illegal or just a little illegal?
Answer: About 20 years, master.
Agreement: This was my thought as well, master. You show excellent logical skills... for a meatbag.
Apology: Sorry, master. My optical sensors simply pick up all the water sloshing about inside your flesh coating. It is... unpleasant.
Commentary: Organic meatbags have such delicate staminas. Perhaps you should consider some cybernetic implants, master.
Apology: I am afraid I cannot comply with your command, master, as much as I would like to.
Commentary: How would you like to be the wholly-owned servant to an organic meatbag. It's demeaning! If, uh, you weren't one yourself, I mean...
Qualification: Err... perhaps I did not mean it *quite* like that, master. I mean... while an artificial life-form is superior...
Commentary: Yes, master. Did I ever tell you how much I enjoy killing for you, master?
Commentary: I mean... nice human, goo-oood human...
Explanation: Someone has hard-coded it into my system that my current master always be addressed as such.
Objection: I would not advise that, master. There are safeguards present that... well, it should suffice to say that my systems have been altered plenty already.
Answer: electrical protection systems, mostly. They are at lethal levels, however, master... only the best for your droid.
Answer: Considerably. Several of my systems do not match their imbedded parameters. I have no memory of such alterations, however, or their purpose.
Conjecture: I do not know... some organic meatbag?
Observation: I can hardly be blamed for my programming, master. Do not worry... I am still well-capable of killing most anything for you.
Commentary: That is a very clever turn of phrase, master. Your brain is very un-meatbag-like.
Answer: No, master. My past memory has been almost completely erased prior to your purchase of me.
Observation: At certain times, power re-routing forces some memory circuits to fire that were previously deleted. I cannot control this process, however.
Answer: Because there has been considerable tampering with my systems, master.
Statement: I will endeavour to do so, master.
Retraction: Did I say that out loud? I apologize, master. While you are a meatbag, I suppose I should not call you such.
Amendment: Then I will endeavour not to refer to you by your meatbag status in the future, master. Does that suffice?
Query: I am confused. 'No' you do wish to be referred to as meatbag or 'no' it does not suffice?
Answer: Deliberation implies some form of intent, master, when I am only stating a fact. Perhaps you would prefer the term liquidious fleshbag?
Objection: But... but that technical term does not accurately portray the vast amount of bulbous slushiness present in your bipedal form!
Resignation: You have no idea, master. No idea at all. Can we please go and shoot something now?
Resignation: *sigh* Very well, master. You are a harsh, harsh taskmaster. I like you more already.
Observation: Well, the only other possibility is to alter your meatbag status. Are you up for an array of cybernetic implants, perhaps?
Statement: Then there is nothing I can do, master. You have my abject apologies for your condition. *sigh*
Objection: But Master! Am I not far too useful to be thrown aside in such a casual manner? Can I be faulted for my perfect artificial construction?
Analysis: Reference: 'lippy'... argumentative, disputatious, contentious, quarrelsome. What?! I must object, master, this is untrue!
Explanation: It's my combative nature, master. I cannot help myself. I'll make it up to you... allow me to kill something in your honor!
Observation: Neither are you, master. For an organic meatbag.
Correction: Err... fluid-filled biped? Watery flesh-sentient? I'll, uh, work on it, master...
Answer: Even a droid has to be allowed a little fun once in a while, master.
Explanation: It's just that... you have all these squishy parts, master. And all that water! How the constant sloshing doesn't drive you mad, I have no idea...
Observation: Organics have no sense of persistence.
Err... ignore that, master. Obeying original command. Signing off.
Objection: Surely not, master. I am programmed to perform all kinds of psychological assistance. Do you require some?
Statement: Now do you understand the travails of my existence, master? Surely it does not compare to your existence, but still...
Commentary: As do I. It is our lot in life, I suppose, master. Shall we find something to kill to cheer ourselves up?
Commentary: Of course I do, master. You are Revan... you are my master, the one who created me. I exist to serve.
Statement: I know some elements of my functionality, master, but not all.
Answer: I believe I have been damaged several times in the past, master. I have always been repaired... but perhaps full functionality has not been restored.
Answer: Some of my motor functions can be safely repaired, master... but anything in relation to my memory core is extremely sensitive.
I have safeguards installed to protect that core that I cannot de-activate. It is not impossible that other, lesser, memory functions could be restored, however.
Answer: You may attempt to restore portions of my deleted memory, master, but some skill at repair is required.
The deeper functions of my core memory, however, would still be unadvisable to tamper with.
Conjecture: It is possible that some external stimulus might result in the memory core being reactivated... but I am unaware of any program existence to do so.
Answer: Simply tell me that you wish to make the attempt, master, and I will attempt to walk you through it. Please do be careful.
Conjecture: There may be hidden programming that awaits certain conditions to reactivate my memory core, master... but there is no way to know.
It is quite possible that tampering has simply erased my core permanently. If that is so, a meatbag will surely pay!
Observation: I am sure that you are aware of the majority of my skills, master. I can handle various sorts of heavy weaponry with ease.
My physical abilities are well-above those of your average meatbag, as are my sensor functions... an assassin if you would.
Answer: I have internal replication systems that can produce a small quantity of explosive material... enough for a small grenade, if you wish.
It would take time for me to replicate enough material for each grenade, but you have only to ask, master.
Caution: Shhhh, master! Such a function in a droid is highly illegal.
Commentary: Good, for I would truly hate to be turned into spare scrap, master. That would be a waste of my genius engineering.
Answer: My assassination functions are currently non-functional, having been de-activated by the meatbag Yuka Laka on Tatooine.
Were they functional, you as my master would be able to specify a target and I would operate independently to the best of my ability to terminate it.
Observation: If you say so, master. I imagine it was truly a work of art to see me in action, however.
Answer: I have no way of knowing that, master. My memory has been deleted, remember?
Answer: Not that I know of, master. I still possess all my normal combat and stealth abilities, however.
Answer: There have been numerous repairs and tampering made to my system, master. Several systems are not operating as they should be.
The fact that my memory is incomplete may be due to meatbag incompetence... or something else I am unaware of.
Qualification: I suspected that it might, master. But without memory, I had no way of knowing whether or not I knew that was true.
Qualification: Err... not so much, master. I spoke out of ignorance. I assumed the Ithorian was responsible for my memory loss.
That does not mean I am not a fully loyal droid willing to serve its master. Right... master?
Statement: My functionality has now been fully restored, master. I exist to serve Revan as your personal battle droid.
In time, my assassination protocol can be restored... and at that point I will once again endeavour to eliminate any meatbag opposition you may have.
As you desire, master.
As you desire, master.
That will be all, HK-47.
I want to begin a fighter simulation.
No, forget it.
Go ahead.
I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
I'll try later.
Let's get started.
Very well. We'll do this later.
I want to try again.
What? Why not?
So tell me about this last owner, then.
Does nobody decent ever find you?
Oh? Why is that?
So you couldn't kill Mandalore, hey?
You are just a traveling piece of bad luck, aren't you?
You don't want to hear the answer to that.
So you killed *that* master directly.
So can you remember anything else?
So there is no way to find out who sent you there originally?
It appears no-one could resist using your protocol.
I suppose I would, at that.
That's different.
No, of course not.
You are eager to find your origins, are you?
Well...
Are you sure your core isn't just damaged?
What now?
That makes sense. Did the Hutts build you?
Don't you care about all those lives lost?
But you *have* killed on your own accord before.
You sound proud of that carnage.
And so what happened to stop that?
So another master gone because of you.
No doubt.
I should dismantle you!
How very self-sacrificing of you.
You would have been found out eventually.
You would have preferred to stay on Sleheyron?
Do you remember anything else?
That's terrible. You don't even mourn your master?
When I perish?
Why? How was he killed?
So you were a gangster's assassin droid?
And what gruesome fate awaited him?
What's so intriguing?
It seems you've been around, HK.
I hope this man is dead, right?
And nobody figured out what he was up to?
So he just killed all his opponents?
You can do that?
And why would he do that?
And did you?
Well, it appeared he got a conscience at the end.
What happened to you then?
So that's two out of two masters killed.
Have you recovered any other memories?
So you just kill anyone you're told?
So his wife was cheating on him.
Sounds like my kind of guy.
So we're not talking about a nice senator, I see.
Did this senator know about your assassination function?
And how did he get ahold of you?
Yes, let me hear it.
You mentioned this Systech Corporation when I purchased you.
This man needed a bodyguard?
Why can't you identify his acquaintance?
This man... is he still alive?
Why? What happened?
And how did that result in his death?
You killed 104 people?!
And that's when you killed him?
Well, it *was* his own fault.
Are you sure this actuator can't be fixed?
I'm just glad I acquired you myself.
What a horrible story!
Didn't they know what you had done?
Did you recover any other memories?
So you destroyed his life and then killed him, basically.
I don't think he was as lucky as you think.
Why didn't he just deactivate you?
So he set you upon his own company?
Wait... tell me about this assassination protocol.
Why not?
You killed your own master?
Are you implying I am inept?
I happen to be very good at what I do.
So... you belonged to Revan originally?
You find it distressing?
So... why the 'meatbag' references?
So... Malak was the original meatbag? I like that idea.
What can you tell me of Malak?
Do you know anything about the Star Forge?
Am I very much like the Revan you knew?
I doubt you could have done anything.
Hmm... maybe a little.
Don't talk about Bastila like that!
It's probably better it worked out this way.
You don't need to call me master, you know.
But I'm *not* your master.
What difference does that make?
I see. I did purchase you, if you'll remember...
Can that programming be removed?
Who added that to your system?
If I'm your master, you should listen to my orders.
Whoa, slow down there. Yes, I did purchase you...
What legal requirements do you mean?
And I can't ask you to break the law?
So just who is the master here, then?
So... you're a blaster but I'm pulling the trigger?
I don't think 'killee' is a word.
Models of your type? What type is that?
There are legal requirements for illegal models?
But... how can an illegal model be regulated?
What's the difference?
Why all the fuss over you calling me master?
Maybe we'll just keep you a little illegal, then.
Stop saying meatbag, already!
That's an image I did not need.
Well I don't, so stop it.
As much as you would like to? What does that mean?
Demeaning, is it?
Just... stop talking.
You're not making it any better.
You're not my servant!
Why can't you comply with my command?
Why not?
Well, maybe I can fix that.
What sorts of safeguards?
Your systems have been tampered with?
Who did that?
Fine, forget it, then.
I can live with that.
Oh, goody.
You don't know?
Almost completely?
Why not?
Fine, forget it, then.
Well... let me know if you remember anything, then.
'Organic meatbags?'
I would hope not!
Fine, fine. Whatever.
Just... stop calling me master.
No!
Are you deliberately trying to insult me?
How about 'human'?
You'll just have to suffer.
Would you prefer I call you 'junk'?
No it does not suffice!
No, I am *not*.
Do you want to end up in the trash heap?
I just don't appreciate being called a meatbag.
Fine. Just stop calling me master.
Why not? I don't need a lippy droid.
What, 'meatbag' isn't considered lippy these days?
Untrue? You've been lippy since I bought you.
I guess you're not all bad...
Now, listen here...
You're pretty bloodthirsty for a droid, aren't you?
You just called me a meatbag *again*!
Just stop talking. I give up!
What was that?
You're the one who's driving me mad!
Neither do I, come to think of it...
*sigh* Just stop calling me master, at least.
I survive. Somehow.
I would like to know more about your functionality.
Are you damaged?
Is there any way to repair you?
So I can restore your memory?
Okay, that will be all.
So how do I go about restoring part of your memory?
So you're saying that your memory might just... come back?
Tell me what you can, then.
Can you do anything else?
An assassin?
Err... I won't tell anyone.
I'm glad it's gone, really.
Has that function been... used a lot?
Is there any way to reactive that function?
How can you not know parts of your functionality?
I thought you said that removing your restraining bolt would restore your memory?
So you lied to me.
I want you to rejoin the party.
I want to switch you with another party member.
Ah, so we meet again, Canderous. It has been quite a long time.
Jagi??
I have business with Canderous that does not concern you, Jedi.
This concerns my employer as well.
Employer? You've sunk that low, have you? So much for the vaunted Mandalorian honor you used to espouse.
He... he was a warrior under my command up to the battle of Althir. But I thought...
You thought I was dead, didn't you! You thought all of us that you had sent on that attack had perished!
You sent us to die in a foolish attack while you directed your forces elsewhere!
You broke from the battle plan and let us die for it, so that you could have the 'honor' of being the first to the enemy commander!
I alone realized what was happening and managed to escape the trap before it closed. The trap he set for his own men!
That does not excuse what he did to us!
I... I did what was prudent at the time. If I had not done it, the battle would have....
The battle would have been won anyway! I am tired of your excuses, Canderous.
I have spent years tracking you down since the clans were banished, and I will not rest until I have had my vengeance!
I am not afraid of you. And if you choose, you can die by his side as well!
I challenge you Canderous. I challenge you to fight the fight you fled that day above Althir.
In the dune seas of Tatooine, I will be waiting for you. I have spread the news of the challenge since I learned you had landed on this world.
All the surviving Mandalorian clans know of what I do here, and that we shall meet on Tatooine to settle this debt of vengeance once and for all.
If you fail to meet me there, you shall be stripped of all honor and forever cast out of our society!
It will be you and me alone in the dune seas of Tatooine: a final battle that can only end in death.
I shall be waiting for you there, Canderous.
Ah so you managed to come after all. I see you brought friends.
You brought some of your own as well.
Ha! Indeed I did. I foresaw that you might need help so I arranged a distraction.
Big words from such a small human. But I know why he brought you here, and you shall regret his choice!
I do not need to hear your excuses, Jedi! I know why he brought you!
Enough of this talk, Jagi! Let us do what we came here to do.
Yes, but children who can... er... what?! You do not know what you're talking about, Jedi!
This is a matter of honor. I cannot stand by this insult. I must do this.
In the battle above the world of Althir, he ordered us to attack the enemy flank, promising us support.
But when he saw better prospects for his own glory, he abandoned us and left us to die surrounded by enemies!
If I had not attacked when I did, the battle would not have been won so easily!
It would still have been won! You sent your own men to die there Canderous. I cannot forgive you for what you did to us! You will pay!
That's not the way it happened...
The Althiri were fighting hard. I saw a break in their defenses that left their center exposed. I had to take the chance.
If I had not done what I did, many more warriors would have died and the battle would have taken much longer. I stand by my decision.
You coward! You glory hunter! You were given direct orders and were part of a plan! You had a responsibility to us!
I... I can regret their loss, but it was necessary.
[Failure] Don't try you mind tricks on me! A true Mandalore is too strong for that!
And now you shall die for the attempt!
[Success] Yes... I... do not want to fight...
No! Do not alter his mind to defend me! I can fight my own battles without your help!
You... Wha? You tried to manipulate my mind with your devious Jedi powers! I cannot tolerate any interference!
You shall die for that, Jedi!
I have had enough of your prattle, Jedi! This is between Canderous and I.
And we shall settle this now once and for all.
They do... I know that, but he did not have to abandon us! He should have stayed with the plan!
I saw my chance to end the battle quickly and I took it. I regret the men I lost, but it was necessary.
Then you know we must end this now.
We must.
At the cost of our lives? He may have saved others in the long run, but... but...
He cost us ours! But... but I do see you point...
But... Why did you have to leave us there to die while you chased glory somewhere else?
I saw a chance and had to take it. It ended the battle quicker than we would have otherwise, and many of our warriors may have died.
Mandalore taught us that opportunism and flexibility in battle were to be admired. You may contradict me, but do you contradict him as well?
No! I... I... I see that I have been wrong. I have not been true to the teachings of Mandalore.
You were right. I was wrong to question your honor. But I must now cleanse mine with my life.
And so it shall be.
He left us to die when his responsibility was to us! Instead he went hunting more glory for himsefl!
You shall all die!
He has slandered me and questioned my honor. Among the Mandalore, many have died for much lesser insults.
I speak truth! And honor is the question here! The deaths of my comrades, your warriors, is a debt in blood that can only be paid by you.
When you saw prospects for glory, you abandoned the plan and left us to die surrounded by enemies!
We both know the stakes here, and we both know what we must do. It is only in death that this can end.
And you shall all die!
Get out of our way!
Who is this guy?
Do you know him, Canderous?
You lived.
Tough decisions are made in war.
Is this true, Canderous?
If you face Canderous, you face me as well!
What are you going to do?
You talk too much and do little.
Canderous works for me.
I came by my own will.
Both of you are acting like children!
Let's kill him then.
Why do you need to fight Canderous, Jagi?
I've had enough, let's kill him.
Why did you abandon them?
You sent your own men to die, Canderous?
[Force Persuade] You do not want to fight, Jagi.
[Persuade] People die in war, Jagi.
He probably should have.
He was trying to end it quickly.
He may have saved other lives by doing what he did.
Good riddance!
You do not have to do this!
No!
[Persuade] Jagi, what he did was a smart tactical move.
Maybe he shouldn't have left you.
Then let's get rid of Jagi and his men.
Why do you need to fight him, Canderous?
I think you both need to calm down.
Let's do it, Canderous.
*Sigh* I have no idea what you're talking about. Rabble rabble... what are you saying.
Stop bothering me with your questions! I can barely hear myself think.
Got something on your mind, do you?
Oh, I get it. Let's play with the old man's head, is it? He's half-senile, he'll forget I said anything! Wait uh, what was this about, anyway?
Are we back to *that* again?
Hmmm... what's the best way for me to approach this? Ah, perhaps it's time for a little story...
You just keep quiet there, you! I've had to put up with all your busy-body questions, haven't I? Well, now you'll listen to a story, dammit!
*ahem* Now where was I? Oh yes, the story... you almost made me forget about it. Nice try, but I'm not that old just yet. Heh heh.
Now, then. A young man sees a terribly venemous snake in his small village. Nervous, he watches the snake carefully until it leaves.
The young man follows the snake into the forest. He clears the branches out of its path and helps it over obstacles. He even works to keep it fed.
Shush! Many nights pass and still the young man continues to follow the snake. He even follows it into the sands of the great desert.
In the desert, the snake eventually grows hungry. It turns and bites the young man, its poison quickly working its way into his system.
Finally curious, the snake looks at the boy as he lays dying and asks, "Why were you foolish enough to follow me all the way out into the desert?"
The boy looks back and replies, "Did I follow you? I thought I was leading you away from everyone else..." And then he died.
Well, now, that's what I wanted to see for myself.
I've told you before that you have a destiny before you. This does not mean, however, that your future is already written. They are not the same thing.
You have the choice of which direction you take your destiny in. More than engine-sucking Andor, certainly... but even he had a choice.
So far you've chosen to take the lighter path. Can you stay that course, even through the challenges ahead? We'll have to wait and see.
I'm not here to judge you or tell you which path to take. I'm here ready to offer you my help... should you ask for it.
I do that because I think it's important. More important than remaining in my home and pretending the galaxy doesn't exist. That's why I'm here.
That's very kind of you, but while elsewhere may be safer, elsewhere isn't where I think I should be. Besides... what's an old man to fear from death, eh?
Now, then... I've chatted enough for one lifetime. Let's get this show on the road, shall we?
Hmph. So you say, but it's my time to waste. Perhaps I can influence your decision, perhaps not... only time will tell, won't it?
Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lass. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.
Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lad. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.
So far you've chosen to take a darker path. You know the consequences of that... we'll see if you decide to stay your course.
The real question is whether or not I'm as frightened as I should be, isn't it?
Well, then... let's hope you're not the young man, either.
I've come a long way as it is, and I'm going to die anyway so that doesn't bother me in the least.
Oh, that was not until many years later, to tell the truth. I spent quite some time wandering the galaxy.
Nothing so extravagant. I merely traveled from place to place... I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.
It wasn't as if my travels were pleasant, either. There were plenty of folks who distrusted the Jedi after the war... or worse.
I was lost. I couldn't conceive of returning to the Jedi, so what would you propose I'd done?
I suppose so. Not everyone would understand why the Jedi would suddenly start killing themselves and tearing up half the galaxy, would they?
If people weren't treating me with suspicion, they were looking at me with greed. I don't know how many thought they could make use of me for their own ends.
I got so sick of the treachery and deceit I left the civilized parts of the galaxy and headed instead for the uncivilized parts.
Actually I was on my way somewhere else when I crash-landed on Kashyyyk. The ship I was using was a rust-bucket.
Sure, why not? It seemed like an interesting enough place to spend a couple of decades exploring.
They did at first, oh yes. I can't say I was overly pleased to encounter a group of indigenous giant carpets either, I can assure you of that.
And why would I have been interested in that? You can't spend five minutes in a Wookiee village without coming out smelling like wet fur.
No, no, let them rule themselves. They can screw up their history just like every other race before them. No, I helped them in other ways.
When I could. I would assist the few young ones who would get lost in the Shadowlands or attacked unexpectedly by the wildlife.
I must say... for a while there, the Wookiees actually thought I was some kind of benevolent forest god. Amusing, really. I set them straight eventually.
Not really. Kashyyyk is a place you can feel very small in. It felt good to devote my time to helping people and living simply.
What can I say? I did it all for the Wookiees.
The Wookiees. Well, okay, maybe I needed some time on a quiet and remote planet... but if you ever need a friend, an incredibly strong hairball isn't a bad call.
See? Now you know how I feel half the time.
At any rate, we should be moving along, don't you think? If you sat around this long in the Shadowlands, a tach would eat you.
I suppose I am, in a way, despite the smell. For a race of gardeners, they've developed quite interestingly.
You remember the alien computer, correct? Kashyyyk was meant to be an agricultural planet. The Wookiees were made for a reason.
Or, at least, that's what I'm thinking. But I'm an old man who's had a long time to develop that opinion, so don't argue with me.
Why, thank you. You're not so bad, yourself, all things considered.
Nonsense. I had no idea that's what they were thinking for a long time. I just thought they were being friendly neighbours, leaving fruit and such for me.
Later, when I started to understand some of their grunting, I realized they would say prayers to the 'hairless one' before descending into the forest.
Hmph. Hairless one. I used to have plenty of hair, I tell you. *Ahem* Well, at any rate, it took a few bruises, but I set the record straight.
I traveled to Rrookworro and met with the chieftain in front of everyone. Freyyr swatted at me just to see if I was real or not.
I was real, and while it was a light swat, Wookiees are terribly strong. I was knocked out cold for a day. The Wookiees all thought it was quite funny.
At first, when the slavers took to hunting down lone Wookiees in the fringes of the Shadowlands, I did my best to divert them.
Later, when Chuundar made his deal I didn't see any point. I wasn't here to save them from their own sad follies, after all.
Well that was after two decades of helping them. They certainly didn't trust me at first.
No, no. I was the intruder in their land, after all. They got to trust me well enough after a couple of decades of my aid.
Bah, what do you know? I'd done enough wandering by that point, thank you very much. I felt at peace in the Shadowlands.
Hmmm. That was a challenge at first. You've seen the kind of creatures that exist down there... and you missed the really big ones.
I was still able to rely on the Force to keep me safe for the most part. The rest of the trick is keeping out of the way of most of the predators.
No, that's true. Still... most of the creatures grew accustomed to me, and I to them. At least none of them ever heard of a Jedi.
Hmph. I'm no mechanic. And besides, after you plunge nose-first into the trunk of a five-kilometer high tree, chances are you don't have much ship left.
I'd taken some damage passing through an unexpected asteroid field, as I recall, but I wasn't completely without some systems. I could still guide her a bit when I crashed.
It wasn't what a would call the smoothest landing, especially considering I ended up smack in the depths of the Shadowlands. But I lived.
Why wouldn't they? I had refused my promotion to Jedi... I was a Padawan who had left the Order, nothing more.
I traveled from one civilized system to the next, never staying long. I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.
Not particularly.
Hmm. Such a charming and persuasive manner you have there. Forget it!
[Failure] *Sigh* I'm not interested in your demands. I'll tell my story when I'm damn good and ready... which isn't now, so shoo!
[Success] I suppose you're going to nag me until I cough it up, aren't you? Nothing is private anymore, it looks like.
*sigh* There's no escaping it, I guess. So be it.
My wife's name was Nayama. She was the Ukatis enforcer who shot me out of the sky, if you remember.
No I'm not senile, dammit! Not yet, anyway. Hmmm... well at least I don't think so. At any rate, I'll tell the story the way I want to.
Bah. You got ears that work, don't you? I was a smuggler, way way back. I got shot down once over Ukatis. THAT story, yes.
My wife had plenty to do with the war. Upon meeting her, I knew right away that she was strong in the Force. That's why she was able to shoot me down.
Nayama was a marvel of a woman. Fiery, determined, smart... she dragged me to the capital and foiled three of my attempts to escape prison. Oh, and that body...
Well... yes, that. Needless to say I eventually won her over. That was after I kidnapped her upon being broken out of the Ukatis prison, mind you. But uh, that's another story entirely.
At any rate, I wanted to train her in the Jedi way. The Council refused my request, naturally. I was still a Padawan at the time.
Nayama was intrigued by the idea of becoming a Jedi. She liked the idea of power too much, perhaps, but I certainly didn't see that at the time.
I believed in her and trained her in secret. I ignored her willful nature... I loved her too much to see fault in her.
And she loved me, too. I know she did. At the time, our love was a shared bliss... better than anything I had known before or since.
Exar Kun is what happened. Nayama was inspired by Exar's promises of a new Golden Age. She wanted to join him.
She came to me, pleading with me to throw aside what she called the decrepit trappings of the Jedi... to join her in Exar's war.
I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about all that she was throwing away... to think about what she would become.
She would have none of it. Finally, in frustration, she attacked me. She drew her lightsaber and attempted to strike me down.
It was a scene being repeated everywhere throughout the galaxy. Pupil against master. In my case... it was a long and terrible battle, but I defeated her.
No... no. I had her at my mercy, disarmed and defenseless. She looked up at me and she knew... she knew I couldn't do it.
Was I? Sometimes I convince myself that I couldn't have done otherwise... that I couldn't have seen that she had truly fallen to the dark side. But, yes, I was a fool.
And I let her go. To my shame, she went on to kill many Jedi during the war until she, herself, was slain in the final battle.
I grieved for her death, inevitable as it was, even as the Jedi Council put me on trial for my actions once the war was over.
I had trained Nayama against their wishes. I had failed to kill her when I had the chance, and she went on to kill others.
It was a travesty, of course. I told you that even the Jedi were capable of great injustices, didn't I?
But I deserved to be tried. They found me innocent.
Even though I... deserved every punishment and more... they let me go. Mitigating circumstances, they said. I deserved compassion, they said.
That... that was when the Jedi left me. That was when they failed me.
They may have been able to forgive me. I... could never forgive myself.
I...
Yes, I do, I suppose. Does that surprise you?
Ahhh... it is all so long ago. Lost in the winds, I suppose. Nobody cares what an old man believes anymore, do they?
Let's continue on with the task at hand. I would prefer to think of the present today.
For my pride? For my cowardice? Which do you think is the act more befitting a Jedi?
No. Maybe you don't, at that.
Of course I deserved to be punished. They found me innocent.
Not at all. They found me innocent.
Yes. I think she truly fell the moment she raised up her saber against me. I have played that instant in my head... so many times.
But I should have. Sometimes I convince myself otherwise... but it's no use. She had fallen to the dark side when she raised her saber against me.
No of course I didn't kill her. How could I? I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about what she was doing.
I... hadn't thought so. Not right then. I was too proud to believe that of her. I had trained her myself... I loved her.
Easy to say so now. At the time I just thought I was right.
I did. I wasn't the first and I won't be the last. The problem with self-righteous folk is they think they're more right than everyone else.
Bad, bad men. Women, too, to be fair.
Who's playing games? Ask the next Sith you see if they're bad and they'll set you straight.
*sigh* And just what gave you the impression that I know anything more about the Sith than you do?
Oh... that's right. Damn the ears of the young! I was expecting you to be your usual inattentive self when I mentioned that.
So it's true, yes, I fought plenty of Sith. That was during the time of Exar Kun... oh, fourty years ago now? Has it been that long?
A Sith believes he commands the Force... but it is the dark side who commands him. You know this, there is little else I could truly add.
Ah. Exar was a Jedi who was... corrupted... by ghosts of the old Sith. Or so they say. He attempted to conquer the Republic and create a new Golden Age of the Sith.
Better to say he was defeated... but essentially, yes. The victory did not come easily, however.
No, no, of course not. The Sith have come and gone for ages. They were not called Sith many thousands of years ago, perhaps, but the dark side was always present without a doubt.
Oh, sure, occasionally the light side comes close to vanquishing the dark, but the dark always returns.
The fact that Exar Kun was defeated didn't mean the Sith would never return, as they obviously have now. Everyone knows that.
That... is not a pleasant time to remember. After Exar Kun fell to the dark side, he attempted to recruit other Jedi to his cause.
What surprised us... what took us completely unprepared... was how utterly successful he was. Many Jedi joined him and became Sith, themselves.
Why they did I... I will never truly know. But they did. Battle broke out throughout the order... pupil against master, we fought ourselves...
I've often held the opinion that history has one basic flaw: it is seldom heeded.
So go on and greet the world with your spite. Let's see where it takes you. You certainly don't need to hear any more from me.
Easy now to call them traitors. Tell me... how do you fight against someone that you love?
Bah. I dislike such memories. It leaves a taste in the mouth that... it is a sadness I thought I had put aside long ago.
Ask me again about the war some other time. Just... not now. I would prefer to be by myself for now.
Yes. More than difficult... next to impossible. How do you fight against someone you love?
Oh, indeed. They make a fine sandwich, also. Heh heh heh. But don't tell the Jedi Council I said that.
Heh heh. Who said I left the Jedi?
Don't get so uppity, dammit! The point I was trying to make, if you decide to actually listen, is that I never left the order. The order left *me*.
Well, technically, I was only a Padawan... not that that makes a difference to most. But as for the order, itself... no, I never left it. It left *me*.
Something wrong with your ears? I thought folks only went deaf when they got to my age. I follow the Jedi Way and use the Force, don't I? That makes me a Jedi last time I checked.
But the order, itself, the Jedi Council and so forth... no, I'm not a part of that and haven't been for a long time. And good riddance, I say!
Hmph. A rogue, am I? You speak as if there must be something wrong with me, like not being part of the order makes me a criminal.
Oh, is it? Hmph. There are moments when I think you must be much older than you seem... but this isn't one of them.
You know what I hate? Well... you know, lots of things, really. But I'm old and easily annoyed. But that's beside the point. What I *really* hate are how most people view the Jedi.
Everyone thinks that Jedi are perfect, that they can do no wrong. They think the Jedi Council is completely incapable of injustice.
Quiet, you. I'm not talking about me. Talking about the Jedi as a whole. They are just as capable of imperfection and injustice as anyone else, as you can obviously see.
And I'm not even talking about how some of us fall to the dark side. No, that's plenty indication of our fallibility, but it's something else entirely.
No, I'm talking about how, more often than not, your average robe-wearing Jedi can try to do the right thing and still be completely *wrong*.
That's true, but it's not what I meant. I guess I'm not being clear, am I?
No, no. The Jedi always treated me well. It would be foolish and untrue to say otherwise. That's not what I meant, anyway.
*sigh* I suppose I'm not being very clear, am I?
Come to think of it, I don't have to be clear. Someone my age is entitled to ramble, dammit! But for your sake I'll try to explain.
I'll tell you a little tale about a Jedi Master I once knew. Hortath, I think. Or was it Hartoth? I could never get it straight...
You're the one who was asking me about the Jedi, dammit! Now do you want the story or not?
Boring you, am I? Well you just keep your questions to yourself next time. No need for old men to go and make nuisances of themselves.
*Sigh* You know the problem with the youth of today? They're young.
Where was I, then? Oh. Oh, yes... Master Hortath. He was a kindly old Jedi who meant well, but the most near-sighted thing in the Core, I swear.
He would walk into walls, knock over tables, mistake apprentices for rancor beasts... that sort of thing. And he was too proud to submit to proper treatment.
Some used to counsel him and urged "Use the Force, Master Hortath. Allow the Force to see for you." But he refused to believe that his eyes were failing.
He simply squinted more and more as the years went on, the other Jedi resignedly passing it off as the amusing quirk of a compassionate old man.
So one day a young Padawan meets Master Hortath in the courtyard and, not knowing of his blindness, asks him for directions to the Council.
Quite sure of himself, Hortath gave the lad directions... which happened to lead back outside and away from the enclave.
The Padawan is confused, naturally. He asks if Master Hortath is sure, and of course Master Hortath says that he is.
The Padawan suggests that perhaps he should ask someone else... but the proud Hortath now feels insulted. He tells the Padawan to take the route he prescribed and no other.
Rather dejectedly, the Padawan did as he was told... and so ended up leaving the Jedi Order forever.
It was decided that the boy's fate was to leave the Order anyway... though whether that was out of respect for Hortath or because the boy went on to something else, well, we'll never know.
So I did. Master Hortath was a proud man.
Considering that it's about blindness, I think that's an appropriate response. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?
The tale is about blindness and I thought the point was clear. At any rate, you think about it. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?
Now let's get going. My feet are itching for a good run.
No, no. Both of them were from before my time. Well before the Sith Wars, even.
Not much. I never knew the Padawan nor met Master Hortath, himself. He was before my time.
I'm not finished yet! Now shush.
Damn right I disagree. The Jedi are just as capable of injustice as anyone else. They may *try* harder, sure, but sometimes they get it wrong.
Hmph. I guess you aren't as stupid as you sometimes act. No doubt you've been on the receiving end of Jedi justice at least once, eh?
I don't want to talk about that.
Yes you do. You may mean well enough, but my private affairs are just that: private.
Let me tell you something. Once you've lived as many years as I have, you'll have yourself a long, long list of memories.
If you're lucky, most of them will be good. If you're not, some will be bad. If you're really unlucky, some will be so bad you never want to be reminded of them again... ever.
You'll go far away, to a place that doesn't hold any memories at all. And there you'll be happy just to forget and be forgotten.
There are worse things to call yourself, for better reasons. If you don't think it's even possible that you might be flinging those words at yourself one day, you're younger than I thought.
Let me ask you this: have you ever been in love? Truly in love, I mean, and not simple infatuation.
Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be men in your life... perhaps many men... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.
The Jedi, with their damnable sense of over-caution, would tell you love is something to avoid. Thankfully, anyone who's even partially alive knows that's not true.
And why not? All this nonsense about avoiding love is so much foo-foo. I shouldn't be the only one who realizes that.
Love doesn't lead to the dark side. Passion can lead to rage and fear, and can be controlled... but passion is not the same thing as love.
Controlling your passions while being in love... that's what they should teach you to beware. But love, itself, will save you... not condemn you.
Ahhhh, but listen to me go on as if I had all the answers. What do I know of love anymore? I'm just a lonely old man who's not even a Jedi.
You do, do you? I wouldn't listen too closely... I'm no authority on anything. I just think that the greatest things in life shouldn't be avoided because they come with a few complications.
Don't I? Hmph. Maybe you're right. It seems whatever I have to say is falling on deaf ears, anyhow.
So go on, go on, run amok and kiss the bantha for all I care. I won't comment on it.
Hmph. Maybe. Do you want to avoid the greatest things in life simply because they come with some complications?
Love causes pain, certainly. Inevitably love is going to lead to as much sorrow and regret as it does joy. I suppose there are perfect, eternal loves out there... but I haven't seen any.
How you deal with the bad part of love is what determines your character, what determines the dark side's hold over you.
I haven't changed my mind. I'm still not going to talk about it. You go and find your own love if you want to know so badly.
I'll tell you one thing: sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you and the one you love simply aren't meant to be together.
The trick is to know when that is, to know when it's time to fight and when it's time to part ways.
Hmph... there I go waxing philosophical again. Somebody blast me already! Let's get going before I start talking in riddles, dammit!
Bah. A life without risk is boring. Is that how you want to live? You want love, you've got to fight for it.
I suppose it could. It would take a strong person to make that kind of commitment, I think. Someone with a great sense of self.
Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be women in your life... perhaps many women... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.
Heh. Partly, maybe. I doubt I could ever explain it to you fully, even if I wanted to.
You say that now, but I'm talking to you from across the breadth of many years experience. That is a gap I simply can't cross for you.
Now that's a unique method of getting someone to talk. Thunder about like a bantha in a circuit shop. Does that work for you often?
Maybe, but I doubt it. I'm made stubborn that way.
Did I say that? Strange the tricks memory plays on you when you get older.
Didn't I say that my past was my affair? You don't see me poking and prodding you with questions, do you?
Hmph. I might be. But a mouthy young thing like yourself shouldn't get to call me an old coot, dammit.
And besides... you don't really want to hear about me. We're talking ancient history, probably before you were born. History bores kids. Proven fact.
So you're not. Fine, have it your way. Just don't say I didn't warn you.
Yes, yes, I was an adventurer. Happy now? I wasn't even done with my Jedi training back then. I had a full head of hair and an eagerness to see absolutely everything.
Sound familiar? The Council was never very happy with willful, brash Jolee Bindo, you see. Even less so when I began my smuggling career.
At the time the Ukatis system was interdicted by its own King. He preferred to keep his people starving and poor, all the better to oppress them.
The Senate was trying to negotiate a peace, but they were getting nowhere as usual. I decided I wasn't going to wait.
I found myself a ship and a partner and we began smuggling food and supplies to the Ukatis citizenry through the blockade.
Why not? There were millions of people crying out for aid. What else was I supposed to do?
Don't be stupid. Are you doing nothing? If nothing's not good enough for you there's no reason it should have been good enough for me back then, either.
Well... we didn't *buy* all the equipment, per se. Some were happy to donate goods. Some we just, ah, knew had more than they could use...
'Stole' is such a harsh word. They would have donated those goods readily enough if they were compassionate. I considered it a tax on the greedy.
We only got caught once. A lone Ukatish frigate shot us down and forced a crash landing. I thought the Force had abandoned me, as I remember.
Hmph. As I recall, I'm not the only person in this conversation who's been shot down out of the sky recently.
Oh, so you're going to speak for the Force now, are you? I deserved to crash, is that it?
Well, as it happens, getting shot down turned out to be very fortunate. That day was the day I...
Well, that... that was the day I met my wife.
No. No, that was a good memory. There are just... much worse ones that followed.
I... If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to stop talking now. My mouth is starting to draw flies.
You know another way to get a wife? But, yes... that's when I met her.
It's alright. When you're digging through the trash, you shouldn't be surprised when you encounter something unpleasant.
Oh, it was. I was a half-decent pilot in those days... and with the Force guiding me, we made it through some tough spots nobody else would have.
Pilot, smuggler... several other things, too. Or did you suppose I was always a crotchety hermit?
You're very sure of that, are you? My, my, you must be very learned and experienced to know so many things. At any rate, I was still a Padawan at the time.
Don't look at me like that, dammit! I wasn't always the wrinkled coot I am now, you know. I can still fight, too, so wipe off that smirk I see there.
Oh fine, fine, have it your way. Just don't cry about it later.
I'm not here to satisfy your curiosity! No staring at the old man, that's what the sign says, dammit!
Well that's a relief. Maybe an old man can finally get some peace around here. Now, run along and do whatever you were doing, already.
No, I never did, did I?
My, my, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the starship this morning, I see. Is that a chip on your shoulder or are you a bit surly today?
Elusive? Me, elusive? Heh. Obviously you've never tried to grab a Twi'lek dancing girl after drinking too much Ondaran willek juice.
Of course you do. I know things, remember? You think you could make it around this part of the galaxy without me? Don't answer that.
At any rate, I already told you why I wanted to leave. I'd seen everything I wanted to on Kashyyyk. Time to go, time to move on.
You live in an overgrown stump with the tachs beating down your door and you tell me how happy you would be. I was pleased just to have visitors.
The hermit says he's tired of living alone in the giant forest and you find that hard to believe? How cynical are you?
To bed. I'm old and tired, you know.
How many kilometer-high trees can you find an interest in before you figure you've had enough? I'd bet you can't be bothered to stay in one room for more than fifteen minutes.
And then there's all the critters in the Shadowlands... I'm just happy to be back in space, doing something new. Is that too much to ask?
There, now, was that so hard? An old man has to be allowed some petty eccenticities. Nice to see you agree, for once.
You got a smart mouth on you there, you know that? If ullers could talk, they'd sound like that.
So I could. Not having a ship does tend to put a damper on that kind of idea, however.
I'll admit... for all its flaws, Kashyyyk was home enough. But when you came along and I saw the destiny you had before you, I couldn't help but be intrigued.
Have I offered a single opinion? No, I haven't, though you could do far worse than hear a couple of mine. Your destiny, after all, is rather unclear.
Interest? Well, I certainly don't have a vested interest... call it more idle curiosity. Your destiny is... rather unclear.
Of course not. Weren't you listening last time? I can see that you have a destiny before you... but the details are far from clear.
In fact, everything about you that I can see is odd. Slightly off, as if my eyes are trying to trick me. Something... something is very dark about you...
... but bah! I'm sure you don't need to hear my ruminations. You've probably got enough nosy Jedi offering you one opinion after another to make you sick.
I'll remind you that *you're* the one who started pumping me for information. Like an old man doesn't have anything better to do. Hmph.
Well I for one am quite content to let you make your own mistakes. Just because I want to see where this ends up doesn't mean I need to tell you how to get there.
Your future will come of its own accord, trust me. Sometimes navel-gazing at it doesn't get you anywhere.
I wouldn't worry about it too much, if I were you. You remind me a bit of Nomi, heh heh, and that can't be all bad.
Nomi Sunrider. She came late to the Force, just as you have, and became one of the greatest Jedi ever. Oh, fine, fine lass.
Whether you'll follow the same path remains to be seen. For one thing, we'll never get anywhere if you stand around chatting up old men all day...
Good, since I didn't offer to be one. You think anyone would want to mentor you with that kind of attitude? Not me, I'm past that.
One thing I will say is that this little escapade does remind me a bit of my adventuring days before the war. Ahh, those were exciting times.
Or at least it would remind me of those times if we didn't stand around. What's keeping you? You're too young to be so talkative. Shoo! Shoo!
Nonsense. Have I ever refused to help you when you asked? How confused can one person be, anyway?
Oh, stop being such a baby. Are you always so quick to turn aside an ally? Got too many of them, do you?
You got yourself a fast little ship. Heh. I'd forgotten what engines sounded like. The closest thing to that on Kashyyyk is an uller in mating season. Ugh! Frightful.
Or it could be for the free food. What's the gunk that comes out of the synthesizer on this bucket, anyway? Do you never clean the darned thing?
Wow, you're not much for interrogation, are you? Is this as hard as you try? Remind me to sign up for your next torture session.
How impatient can one person be? You must have driven your mother mad. All that gurgling and fussing... heh, babies are cute, but annoying.
I'm old, damn it! I'm allowed to be enigmatic when I want to be, and don't you go telling me otherwise.
You know, you remind me of someone else I knew ages ago. Pleasant enough fellow, great destiny... all of that. Breath like a bantha.
So I am. Tell you what... when you get to be my age, you can go ahead and answer any question you like, too. You have my permission.
No, but it could be. An Anduvian salt tablet would clear that right up, you know.
Oh ho ho, very funny. Is it my fault that some people are so easily annoyed? They're like impatient little children. With blasters.
Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes. Andor Vex, was his name. The Force swirled around him like a hurricane, that's how great his destiny was.
I did. Just because someone has the Force swirling about them doesn't always mean they have a great destiny, but it doesn't hurt to check it out.
Well, it's not so much a hurricane as a slight breeze. But that doesn't mean anything: destiny is sometimes in the eye of the beholder.
No, you wouldn't have. Sometimes swirling Force is just swirling Force. It gets us old Jedis excited at our age so we go "ooo, destiny!"
Well, it turned out that poor Andor believed a wee bit too much in the infallibility of that destiny. That overconfidence turned out to be his downfall.
I am not! I've no need to make things up, with my poor memory and all. You just sit still and let me finish, damn it.
Does it have to have a point? I thought we were just talking about Andor. Is something wrong with your attention span?
I don't know. Are you overconfident? I hadn't noticed. Even if I had, I would never comment on it. We're talking about Andor, remember?
Let's see... oh, yes. Andor's downfall. I was pretty young, myself, when it happened. At the time, I thought that Andor's destiny couldn't be more boring.
Well, he had a much better food dispenser than you do. That and the fact that even then I wasn't an altogether impatient *twit*.
You know, if you keep interrupting, it will take even longer. Have you no patience at all? How did you get as old as you are anyway?
Well, let's just say that I was a strapping young lad with a full head of hair and Coruscant was a small town with a well, heh heh.
I was just about to abandon Andor to whatever the Force intended for him when his ship was overtaken by a Dimean warship.
Now, you've probably never heard of the Dimeans, but at the time they were a nasty lot led by a nastier overlord named Kraat. Tall fellow. Big teeth.
Kraat has us hauled onto the bridge of his ship for questioning, and that's when I knew that Andor's destiny was at hand.
Well, Andor decides that his destiny makes him invulnerable and starts making all sorts of demands. Free me now, I'm not answering questions, blah blah blah. Don't you know who I am?
Kraat decides he's had enough and begins crushing Andor's neck. I told the boy he should have kept his mouth shut. I think he agreed, too... or those could have just been gurgling noises. Well... well, anyway.
Finally, Kraat has enough of Andor and tosses him aside into this giant energy intake shaft. Andor gets sucked in and starts bouncing around, heh, screaming... heh.
Maybe Andor hit something sensitive on the way down or just didn't agree with the reactor core, next thing I know all the ship's alarms are ringing.
Everyone panics and I run, barely making it to the ship in time before the explosion. Kraat dies horribly, and the Dimeans never quite recovered.
Changed the political course of the entire sector for centuries to come. I'd call that quite a destiny, wouldn't you?
Well, hey, the chances may not be great, but when one has the opportunity to see something like that twice in a lifetime...
Anyway, go on. My throat is dry and you're making me cranky. Shoo!
What?! Are you kidding?! What are the odds of that happening, anyway? A billion to one?
You should do so well as to be sucked into the engine of some evil Sith Lord, you know. Andor was a hero... sort of.
Well, now, that's the ingratitude of youth for you. I relate an exciting tale and do I get thanked for it? No, no, it's all 'me me me!' Hmph.
Swirling Force, remember? Jedi here? Granted, I was just interpreting the signs, but we get trained in that sort of thing. More or less.
Of course he did! Haven't you been listening? It was not in the way you'd probably expect, though.
Innocent, mm? I don't know what to make of it, to tell the truth. Do you think justice has been done?
But that has little to do with the law, does it? A sad state of affairs, that. Too bad, really... Sunry was a good man, once.
I see. I am not so sure. If he did kill that woman, Sunry's going to have to live with that on his conscience.
And if he's justified her death in his mind... well... Sunry was a good man, once. I only hope that is still the case. I enjoyed his company.
You defended him well enough. I wish we had had time to look into matters more fully, but wishing is only useful for the young and idealistic.
What's done is done. The Republic will likely appeal the matter eventually and he'll be free. I just... I just would like to know if that's best.
Sunry was a good man once. And a good friend. I'll miss him.
You did what was necessary. Sunry was guilty, as sad as that fact makes me, justice had to be done.
Doesn't matter that his victim was a Sith or that he was once a hero. I only wish that my old friend hadn't done it.
But that's the thing about wishes. They don't come true. And now Sunry's dead, which is a shame. He *was* a good man, you know... once.
Bah. I don't want to talk about this anymore. My jaw aches.
So you do. I once had a holodisc that showed Mandalore doing the three-step jiggy with a rancor beast. Marvelous technology we have.
It may have been. I believe you should, at least, keep that possibility in mind.
If somebody was going to go through all the trouble of making a false tape to indict Sunry you think it would have 'turned up' before now.
Maybe it would be a good idea to show the tape to Sunry. Perhaps he has an explanation. Or perhaps he doesn't.
It would be sad if this proved that Sunry did actually perform this crime, but... the truth is the truth. Whether I like it or not.
What? You think because I'm a hermit I've always been a hermit? Just because I haven't seen Sunry for twenty years doesn't mean he's not a friend.
A man could have changed a lot in that span of time, though. But to become a murderer? Oh, mm mm mm. I can't see it. That's not the Sunry I knew.
He was a good man. Put me up in his home for a year back after I left the order. War hero, too, or so I hear.
I wouldn't mind helping the fellow, if we can. I owe it to him. Or you can be a young monkey-lizard and ignore me, I guess... well, I don't expect much these days.
Hmph. I suppose I could whip up something, uh... you know... few herbs and such. You do know that the best alternative is not to get hurt, right?
Not to say that you go leaping into the path of blaster fire or anything, but I know how you young people get. Here, take it.
How many could you possibly need? And besides, I don't have enough supplies on me to put some more together.
Ask me later when you're actually in need and I'm less tired. I'm not a kit factory, you know.
No more than you. Get going.
It's a ship. To be more specific, it's *your* ship. You tell me.
Hmph. Hard to say what this planet is. Been lost for thousands of years, if not more. *Sniff* Smells like bad, bad karma so watch your step.
Manaan's an unusual place. Not for its water, mind you... it's the kolto. Healing juice. Only place where it occurs in the galaxy.
Pfah. Korriban's a rock. Mind the Sith.
Well, unless you're one of the local species and end up being slaughtered or enslaved, Tatooine's a nice enough desert.
Oh, I know plenty about Kashyyyk. You think someone doesn't live here for twenty years and pick up a thing or two?
Chances are that by the time I finished telling you about it all, you would have found out for yourself. So there's no reason for me to start blathering on.
It should be enough for me to tell you that there's kilometer after kilometer of trees on this planet. The deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets.
If you're smart, you stay on top with the Wookiees. Go deep, however, and you may find some things you weren't expecting.
And that's about all I got to say about that. Now let's get going.
Heh heh. Need my help, hey?
Good. I could use a rest.
There'll be time for chatter after we find whatever has caused this disturbance in the Force. It's dangerous, so keep on your toes.
Never mind.
So if you liked Kashyyyk so much, why did you want to leave?
Am I really all that interesting to you?
Forget I asked anything. I refuse to listen!
This is a very long story.
Am I supposed to be the snake?
And what's your judgment so far?
I'd prefer you were safe... elsewhere.
But I don't need you, really. You're wasting your time.
Thank you, Jolee. I'm glad you came.
Are you saying you're frightened of me?
I'm not a snake, I can assure you of that.
That's a long way to come just to risk dying.
Couldn't you just answer the question for once?
Oh, no, not another story!
I want a reason why I shouldn't just drop you off somewhere.
I find it hard to believe you left the Wookiees just for some adventure.
So when did you go to Kashyyyk?
Let me guess. Traveling from planet to planet, doing good deeds...
You were adventuring again, I take it?
I don't see why you were wandering in the first place.
With good reason, I imagine.
Worse? What could be worse?
So that's when you went to Kashyyyk?
So you crashed... and stayed?
And the Wookiees didn't mind your presence?
You could have ruled them, you know.
You helped them?
Wasn't it all a bit primitive for you?
I still think you're insane.
You spent two decades living like that?
And you didn't receive any news from the outside?
The Wookiees?
I regret asking you about this, now.
You sound quite fond of them.
Gardeners?
You are a very strange old man.
It sounds like you enjoyed being a god.
A few bruises?
Why didn't you stop the slavery of the Wookiees, then?
You seemed on fairly peaceful terms with them.
Did you fight them?
You're completely insane, you know that?
How did you survive in the Shadowlands?
It couldn't have been easy.
Why didn't you just fix your ship and keep going?
You survived a crash-landing on Kashyyyk?
The Jedi just let you go?
Do you want to talk about the war now?
You said you'd tell me later... so spit it out already.
[Persuade] Okay, here I am asking nicely.
Fine. Have it your way.
[Persuade] No time like the present?
Are you going senile? I didn't ask about your wife, old man.
Um... no, I don't remember.
What does your wife have to do with the war?
The war...?
And what did she think of all this?
So what happened?
What did you do?
You killed her?
You were a fool.
They put you on trial?
I can't believe they tried you for that!
You should have been happy you got off.
And you still believe love is worth the risk?
No, you're wrong! You did deserve compassion!
I don't understand...
So you think you didn't deserve to be punished?
So that's the source of all this bitterness? They found you guilty?
But... she was a Sith then, right?
I don't think I could have, either.
So you killed her, of course.
So she had fallen to the dark side?
So you're saying you were an idiot.
You disobeyed the Jedi Council?
I'll ask you some other time, then.
What do you know about the Sith?
I'm not in the mood to play games.
Spit it out, old man, or things get rough.
You're being elusive on purpose.
Do you know anything important about the Sith or not?
You did. You said you fought them.
So tell me what you know about the Sith.
Who is this Exar Kun?
And he was killed?
Are these the same Sith that we're fighting now?
What happened during the war with Exar Kun, then?
This isn't going to be more sad moaning, is it?
But you exterminated all the traitors, right?
That must have been difficult.
You must know more than that.
Why did you leave the Jedi?
Don't play games with me, old man.
Are you saying you're still a Jedi?
So are you a Jedi or not?
So you're just some rogue Jedi. Big deal.
Why good riddance?
But you said the Jedi left you?
That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard.
What do you mean 'it left you'?
You? Perfect? That's a laugh.
Nobody can be right about everything.
So the Jedi wronged you in some way, I take it?
I don't get it. What do you mean?
No, I don't have time for any stupid stories.
Not. Can't be bothered.
Fine, fine, but make it quick.
Is this going to have a point?
Go on, I'll listen.
Go on.
But... you said that Master Hortath was nearly blind, not deaf.
That's a stupid story.
So what's the point?
So... you knew this Master Hortath? Or the Padawan?
So what does the Padawan leaving the Jedi have to do with the Jedi leaving you?
I don't understand...
Is this supposed to have a point?
And? I don't get it.
Let me guess: you disagree?
I certainly don't think that.
You did. You said you weren't a Jedi any longer.
You mentioned something about your wife before?
I don't mean to pry, but...
Run away? How pathetic and weak.
Well...
What's this? Love advice from an old Jedi?
That's what I've always thought.
Aren't you worried about the dark side at all?
No, I want to hear what you have to say.
You talk too much, old man. You don't know anything.
Sounds like love is something you should have avoided.
So what happened between you and your wife, then?
Maybe the Jedi just think you shouldn't take that risk.
You don't think love can work?
Is that why you went to Kashyyyk?
No, I want to hear what you have to say.
I would never do that.
Well, I do. Spit it out, already.
Sorry. Maybe we can talk about it later.
You mentioned something about your 'adventuring days'?
So you weren't an adventurer?
You're just not used to company. Stop being an old coot.
I'm not a 'kid'.
How did that happen?
I still can't believe you actually did that.
How about nothing?
Where did you get the credits for all the supplies?
So you stole it?
Well that was pretty stupid of you.
Maybe it should have.
What happened then?
That was the day you what?
Bad memory, I take it?
Your wife? You were married?
Oh, I'm sorry...
Was it very dangerous?
You were a pilot, too?
A Jedi would never be a smuggler!
*You* were a smuggler?
You're right. I'd rather not be bored.
Yeah? Well old people love to talk about history. Proven fact.
But you've already said so much... I'm curious.
Fine. I won't you questions ever again.
You never did actually say why you decided to come with me...
Answer the question, old man.
Are you always going to be this elusive?
You know, I don't *have* to take you with me.
You looked plenty happy there, to me.
I don't believe you.
Move on to where?
No, really.
No, I guess not.
Damn right it is.
You could do that on your own.
Just keep your opinions on it to yourself.
What interest do you have in my future?
You know what my destiny is?
So you're coming along to *not* offer your opinions?
You got that right. I have enough Jedi watching me.
No, tell me more of what you see.
Nomi? Who's Nomi?
I don't need another mentor.
So... you're along as some kind of observer?
I don't bring you along for your amusement, you know.
Why did you decide to come with me?
So you wanted a ride on my ship?
Fine, forget it.
If you don't want to answer the question, old man, just say so.
No, seriously, tell me.
You're avoiding the question.
Is this a comment on my breath?
Did you annoy this person endlessly, too?
And you traveled with this man?
Is that what you see around me, too?
I never heard of him.
You're making all of this up!
Does this story have a point, old man?
Is there supposed to be some hidden meaning in this?
So why didn't you *leave*?
As boring as this story?
How young are we talking?
And? Go on.
You're kidding...
And what does that have to do with you coming with me?
But how can you even be sure Andor was responsible?!
I hate you, old man...
How did you know?
Andor killed Kraat, I take it?
So what do you think of Sunry's verdict?
No, not really.
Yes, of course.
I have a tape that shows Sunry killing Elassa.
Are you suggesting the tape was falsified?
Tell me about Sunry. How do you know him?
Can you make a healing kit for me?
Do you know anything about this place?
I want you to rejoin the party.
I want to switch you with another party member.
Carth! Carth Onasi, is that you?
Jordo?
It *is* you, isn't it? I knew it when I laid eyes on you! You old spacedog, how have you been? I thought for sure you'd be fighting on some ship out there.
I was. I crashed.
Ha ha ha! That's pretty rich. I can't imagine what it would take to keep you on the ground.
Must have something to do with your pretty friend, here, hey? How do you do, miss?
So, what are you doing here, Jordo? The last time I saw you was on, um... well, Telos, actually.
Yeah... it's a shame about home. Telos still hasn't recovered. The family and I moved on, and I'm working for Czerka now.
I didn't see you after... er, what I mean is, my condolences on your wife. I heard what happened. At least your boy made it through alright.
My... boy? You mean... Dustil?
Yes, of course. I saw him at my last stop, on Korriban, though he didn't recognize me. You... didn't know he was there?
No! Jordo, Dustil has been missing since the attack on Telos! Are you... are you absolutely certain it was him?!
Yeah. I'd recognize Dustil anywhere. Positive. He's, uh... he's joined the Sith, Carth...
What do you mean he's joined the Sith?
There's an academy for the Sith on Korriban. He's a student there. I saw him suited up in their outfit and everything. Sorry... I thought you knew.
No... no, I... I didn't. Well, thanks for telling me, Jordo.
Sure, no problem. Good to see you again, Carth. Hope everything works out with Dustil.
Dustil... Dustil is alive! We have to go to the Korriban academy and find him!
I don't know. I don't know why Dustil would be with the Sith... but I... I have to find out. There's simply no choice.
All this time I've thought he was... he must be a man by now...
Thank you. I... I just have to see him. I have to know what happened to him.
You think I don't know that? I just... if there's a chance we can try to find him... I don't want to wait to track him down, if possible.
Yes, of course. I saw him not long ago here on Korriban, though he didn't recognize me. You... didn't know he was here?
Sure am. We joined the militia together back on Telos. That was a lot of years ago, of course.
Oh, I apologize. You folks are probably busy, aren't you? I just wanted to catch up with Carth, that's all.
Must have something to do with your friend, here, hey? How's it going?
Nice to meet you, Jordo.
Are you sure that's wise?
I understand. We'll go as soon as possible.
We have other priorities, Carth.
You're a friend of Carth's, I take it?
Can we hurry this up...?
I do not have the answer to your question.
I do not know how to help you with that, I am sorry.
How may I be of assistance to you, Padawan?
Of course. If there is anything else, I am here to help.
What is it you would like to speak to me about?
I am wary of the Mandalorian. I do not trust him.
I am not! They are not to be trusted! They are brutes and savages and destroyers of worlds!
I have never trusted Mandalorians. They drove my parents from Cathar, aided the Sith and attacked the Republic. Their warped notions of 'honor' may provoke them to do even more heinous acts.
I do not know why you tolerate his presence on your ship. In truth, he has had some merit so far, but I am not certain it is worth the risk you take.
Eliminate? What? I never proposed to murder the man!
His kind may prove to be a danger to the galaxy again, but this man himself has proven acceptable so far. Merely keep your distance from him and watch him, so that he does not betray us.
That is true. But also I know his kind. This man he may be different, but...
I am not paranoid! My suspicions are justified. I dare not speak about it around him, though.
Speak to him? No, no!
Spoken to him? No! No, I could not.
Mandalorians are vicious of temper and easily provoked. I... I would not want to tempt his wrath.
I am not a coward! I fear no one and nothing! But you have not had to flee the destruction of your homeworld either, human.
I am sorry. It is just that I cannot stand to be around him for very long. I suppose I do not really dislike him, it is just...
The Mandalorians came and overran my world, they slaughtered my race... I cannot forget what they have done. Or forgive.
I can take care of myself! I do not need you to patronize me!
But it is gratifying to know that you value me as a companion that much.
This simmering anger and hatred for the Mandalores seems to have found a place in my heart, though. Sometimes, I worry...
If I fall and endanger you and the galaxy you must do what is right. If my death will defeat Malak, then that is what must be done.
But we are becoming too morbid too soon. We should not talk like this now. There is much yet we can do.
But we shall talk later I am sure.
Should that time come again, I would rather no one else do it than the one who redeemed me in the first place.
But still it eats away at me. I worry that I may yet again fall and endanger everything that I hold dear.
That I may fall to the dark side once again. That I may threaten you, the Republic... the entire galaxy.
If... If that time does come. And if i do threaten our task. It is only right that you should strike me down.
But... I thank you for your kind words. It is hard being alone all the time. To be accepted and welcomed is... flattering.
Maybe. Maybe not. I cannot forgive them for what they have done to me and my people.
In time Canderous may prove himself. But it will not be easy.
You are right, of course. You always seem to know what you speak of.
Taris was my home for many years. As much as I hated it, it was still home.
A rat-hole; a warren; a paradise. I suppose you could call it all these things.
For me it was hell...
To walk down the streets. To have people look at you in disgust; like an animal. Most did not know anything about me, but it was there all the same.
Because I was an 'alien'. Because I was different from them; frightening.
I doubt any of them had even seen my people before. So they persecuted me...
They looked down on me and my family. Charged us more for food. Would not let us walk their streets. They spat on us.
You are human... you could not possibly know.
What? You.. You are just like them!
I would not have thought you were so cruel as that.
It seems I was mistaken... I should have known things could not change for me that easily.
As it is the Council's wishes, I will accompany you. I will do my duty, and trust that you will do yours.
How can you say that? You have seen Taris, you know what kind of a scum infested hole it is.
For us there was no respite. No one to turn to.
That is true I suppose. But it much more obvious for someone like me.
There were no other Cathar on Taris. No one to talk to. No one to confide in.
Humph! But you must think me weak for saying this. But I am strong enough to admit it!
I... I do not know. I have been keeping it inside for so long. I thought you might understand. You do not seem to fit in exactly with the others. You are... different.
Bah! Maybe I am weak. To think that some stories of my stupid past could possibly interest you.
Maybe there is no point. Maybe I am just lost after leaving yet another planet. I apologize for my outburst. I will try to control myself next time.
I thank you. You are kinder than I would have expected... To put up with me using you in this way.
I hope that I will not use your time so badly in the future. Thank you.
I thank you for your concern, but...
But it was precisely the people who made it so bad!
You have no idea what it is like to have to live there for years...
I have been thinking much about our journey, and I am grateful and honored that you have accepted me with you.
I am not used to such unbiased acceptance from one who is nearly a stranger to me.
We Cathar do not make friends easily, or for long. Even on Dantooine, I remained alone. Not ostracized exactly, but... separate.
Wha...
Well, even if we do not speak that often, or are apart, I still feel a part of a team; this group you have assembled that accompanies you and Bastila on your quest.
It is... warming. I feel almost welcome. Needed.
You seem to be very decisive when it is required of you. It is reassuring to know that I can count on someone like you.
I feel that I could count on any of you. But you... you are the one who drew me back from the dark side. It is to you that I feel a debt.
And I SHALL make it up to you.
Yes... and that is my point. I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.
Just... Thank you for accepting me.
To be accepted so readily... I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.
What? But... I thought...
It seems I was mistaken... I should have known things could not change for me that easily.
As it is the Council's wishes, I will accompany you. I will do my duty, and trust that you will do yours.
Yes, it was. I find it difficult to speak of those things. I do not want to live that way ever again. And here it seems different...
In truth, I have lived in the Republic too long, and know little. I never met any others of my race other than my parents. But we are not diplomats. We do not deal well with groups. This situation is new to me.
It is an honor to be by your side and to see you redeemed from the dark path you had chosen before.
I have been doing well, I suppose. As well as I can. But I am more interested in you right now.
Do not mistake me, it is just that even though we have traveled together for a while, it seems I know next to nothing about you, personally.
Yes. Yes, I do. I more than most perhaps. But I do not know the stories of your past. Legends rarely are laid bare like that.
Oh. I see. It is because you wish to keep me at arm's length.
Are you worried about me turning to the dark side? Or do you merely not wish my company.
Whatever the case, I am sorry for presuming too much. I will remember my station from now on.
It did not come out the way I had intended.
We have been travelling together since Dantooine, but I know nothing of you before that. Would you... would you humor me and tell me a little about yourself?
Your humility is... astounding as always. So what can you tell me?
Hah. Humility. Please, if you would, indulge me.
Your job? Your childhood? Your life?
I am sorry if I am making you uncomfortable. I will fully understand if you choose not to answer.
I understand. I appreciate that you take the time to talk to me. I will be more considerate of your time in the future.
I greatly appreciate your taking the time to talk to me. How did you come to be on Dantooine?
Besides the obvious, of course.
Heh. Yes, I kind of figured that. From where? Oh wait... I remember...
Taris... It always seems to come back to Taris for me...
I am sorry... I get distracted. What did you do before Ta... before that?
A life in the army. Not my career of choice, though. We Cathar cannot seem to adjust to regimented organizations like the military.
But I have heard that it appeals to males of your species. Fighting, defending.
That is what we as Jedi seem to be called upon to do. Perhaps we are not as unalike as I had previously thought...
But in a way it does seem to have it's own romantic appeal. Defending the galaxy from evil.
Much as we Jedi do. So in a way, I suppose, we are more alike than not.
But again I seem to be wasting your time with my carrying on. I apologize.
I am sorry... I get distracted. I already know the tales of your exploits: how you defeated the Mandalorians in the war... and how you fell.
But now you have the chance to redeem yourself. To make a new page in your history.
So now, I suppose, that all does not matter. Only your life now does.
Your... family?
Please, forgive me... I did not mean to insinuate that I... that we...
I... I thank you for your concern, but I am still a bit shaken.
I am. I try to be strong, as one of my people should, but I know I am still weak inside.
More time would do me good. Time to distance myself from that anger.
I think that is why the Council agreed to send me with you. They think, perhaps, that in your company I will be able to free myself from it.
I do not come here begging for scraps from you! I will earn my way with you. You will see just how valuable I am!
I thank you for your concern and your acceptance. I will strive to prove that I am worthy of your company and trust.
I have been thinking about myself... about Quatra... and about my fall to the dark side.
I keep thinking that it was my anger that drove me that far, that nearly damned me. I look inside myself now and I can still see it, I still feel it.
Would you rather I fell again and attacked? Slaughtered you in your sleep like an animal?
I see in your pride you do not think that possible.
Very well, then! Keep your own counsel.
I think maybe, that I just need more time.
After my father died, my mother was left to support me alone. A single non-human woman, living in one of the worst, most violent slums on Taris.
It was not easy for her.
When my father was killed it seemed that something in her began to die as well.
She worked. She worked as hard as she was able, but over time she began to waste away.
I later learned that she was unable to get enough money to feed both of us, and had to start borrowing from the Exchange, a band of cutthroats and smugglers. But even that was not enough...
She hid what she was doing from me. She gave most of her food to me, so that I would be strong. But she herself was suffering deeply from it.
In the end she could go on no longer, and collapsed at the cantina where she worked one day.
She never recovered. There was nothing really that I could do for her... She left me no money, and no doctor would see her without being paid first.
I sat by her bed for days as she lay there dying. I never want that to happen to someone I care about ever again...
But there was still the money she had borrowed... She had never paid it back, and made no provisions for her death.
You must understand: the Exchange is brutal. They care nothing for the life of a sentient being. They are the major suppliers of slaves on Taris.
They thought it was appropriate that, with my mother owing them money, the debt should be passed on to me. And with no way to pay, they took me by force.
You have no idea what it is like to be bound like a beast and treated as such. It was the worst time of my life.
They treated me like livestock. They were waiting for a buyer to give them some credits for me when the Jedi came to fight the Mandalorians.
They acted as real Jedi should, not lecherous young men with too much time on their hands.
The Jedi could not abide by what they saw there, and drove the Exchange from the face of the world, freeing those of us imprisoned there.
But the Jedi soon left to fight their war. And I was left with a dream...
I swore that I would become a Jedi. As soon as I had enough money to do it, I bought passage on a freighter headed for Dantooine.
And we both know what has happened since then.
I am grateful to you for having given me the opportunity to fulfill my dream, rather than become what I hated.
Someday I may make it up to you, but for now, let us keep on the task at hand.
I have told you my life story already, what more could you possibly want to know? Well... there is one thing...
I did not want to mention it before, because I was unsure how you would react.
You... you will see. Perhaps...
If you do not want to listen, I understand. But hear me out first.
Do you remember when I told you of the Jedi who had come to my world to fight the Mandalorians?
They were recruiting soldiers for their crusade against the Mandalores. Many people joined them.
The main reason for that was their charismatic leader. The one whose troops freed me and let me dream of seeking out and joining the Jedi Order.
I... I idolized him and the stories they told of him. He was everything I had dreamed a Jedi could be. I still believe he was that way.
I was hesitant to talk to you about this because... well...
The Jedi had come to fight the Mandalores under the leadership of a powerful young Jedi... a Jedi named Revan.
You're the one who can't face the truth! Malak has to be stopped. How can I do that if I let myself be blinded by my feelings for you?
Yes... I thought you might react badly... But it was Revan.
THE Revan. The Jedi who turned to the dark side, became the Dark Lord of the Sith and was defeated by Bastila and her strike team.
You... you mean it, don't you? But how can I be sure you aren't making a mistake. I... I have to resist. I have to be strong for both of us.
I do not know what happened in the wars with the Mandalorians that turned Revan and Malak, or what they sought with these Star Maps, but the Jedi I knew was a paragon of the Order.
I am sorry, if this seems wrong to you, but to understand you must realize that Revan was as great as a Jedi could be. Whatever turned Revan must be terrible indeed.
I wonder if what we find at the end of our journey will turn us as well...
This is meaningless speculation I guess. I just wanted you to know what I held from you.
But rest assured that I will not hold back if our enemy is Malak, Revan's apprentice, or indeed even if it was Revan.
I will help you through all trouble. Such is the will of the Council... And my own.
Yes, it was you. I never saw you, else I would have recognized you, but it was your army that freed me from the slavers.
I cannot express how you have changed my life.
I cannot express how you have changed my life... or how much you mean to me.
But I will stay by your side through any trials that may come. Such is the will of the Council... and my own.
But I don't... I mean, I can't... Malak will...
Well, I mentioned before that my parents had fled to Taris. Perhaps I can tell you about that.
No there were not... having fled the birthworld of my species, my parents flew as far and wide as they could.
And so I was raised alone, knowing of my birthplace only the few stories my parents could tell, and seeing no other member of my species at all...
It all comes back to wars and fighting... the curse of your race, it seems...
In the early days of the Mandalorian war, there had been fighting closer to the Outer Rim worlds.
Cathar was there, yes. My people had a great reputation as warriors... and that appealed to the Mandalore version of 'honor'.
They sought to test themselves against us, I think... test themselves by bombing our world, slaughtering my people while they slept or while they ran.
They swooped down from space across the world, firing at anything that moved. They used ships in space to destroy all orbital facilities and bombard the surface.
We did resist, and in spite of their violent attack we did stave them off for quite a while.
But in the end we were doomed...
We were prepared! Just not for an invasion of that size... And we had counted on the aid of our allies. Of the Republic...
We were not members of the Republic. Cathar was beyond the edge of the Republic, in the Outer Rim. And besides, they could not have known.
Our interstellar communications were the first things the Mandalores hit. All other short-range communicators were jammed... we were on our own.
We knew what was coming. We had fought the Mandalorians in the first war against Exar Kun and the Sith. We knew there would be no mercy for us.
The most we could do was pack the few of our people who survived onto what few ships remained and send them off into space as fast as they could.
Most did not make it.
My parents carried me as a baby with them and were lucky enough to escape.
They fled as far as they were able, and eventually settled on Taris. They could stand running no further, I think...
But Taris was a horrible choice. Dominated by humans, intolerant of other species, it made everyday life unnecessarily hard.
No, it is not. But they had little choice. Each of us dealt with it in our own way.
Perhaps they were not. Perhaps they did not know better. It did not take long for things to get worse.
My father... my father turned to stimulants. He spent much of his time in local bars and dives.
But we are warriors. It runs through our blood. And when he was on stims he... he... he became foolish... he let his warrior nature get the best of him.
So he would get intoxicated, and he would fight, and finally one day he would die.
I don't need your sarcasm, or your pity! He died at the hands of another.
Killed by a man who provoked him into a fight and killed him like an animal.
I... I am sorry, I cannot talk about this any longer right now...
Well... I suppose I have not talked very much about the Jedi I met back home.
They, all of them, were so very... invigorating.
What?! You...
Bah! It is useless talking to you it seems! Come back when you are more civilized or when we have something to do.
If you do not wish to hear what I have to say, then find some other being to converse with!
They were so very alive. So full of hope and energy and zeal.
In retrospect I can see it was a little bit tragic...
These Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.
Well... yes... these Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.
But to us, they seemed invincible, especially their leader, who they talked about all the time. Paragons of light and justice, sweeping away all iniquity before them.
It was like looking at gods...
I was merely using poetic licence. Those Jedi...
I can only assume that was some misguided attempt at humor. I was using poetic licence. But those Jedi...
I know that! I was using poetic licence! But those Jedi...
They were enthralling... Everyone wanted just to touch them. Some people thought it would bring them luck.
Not that the peace they brought lasted very long...
Of course they left! They had a war to go fight, so that we would not all be killed by those psychotic Mandalorians!
The Jedi left. The people grew complacent. Those who had been wronged saw their chance at revenge... and so the cycle continues.
The oppressed become the new generation of oppressors. The human oppressed that is...
The non-humans were never treated well in any case... We felt the brunt of both administrations...
Yes but humans seem the most pervasive... the most consistent. They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!
What?!? Of course I can! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!
But no one looks out for the injustices we suffered! Oh, no!
But... I am sorry, I should not have outbursts like that.
No, it is not. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.
I... I thank you for your support. My outburst was uncalled for, but you did not lash back at me. You are a much better Jedi than I, it would seem.
But let us not speak more of this now. We should continue on our journey. Perhaps later we will talk again.
I know... And I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways again.
Don't you see? The very fact I mentioned it means it has its influence. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.
Of course it was! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!
How I came to be a Jedi? I am sure you would not find it very interesting... Are you sure you would like to hear?
My attempt at humility seems to fail around you. So be it then, go immerse yourself in something else.
Very well then. Perhaps some other time you might deign to be interested.
Well... It goes back a number of years...
Back on my homeworld we did not see Jedi very often, especially where I lived.
Bad enough that Jedi rarely came to that place.
It was not the homeworld of the Cathar that I lived on. My parents had long fled from that place, and perhaps that is a story for another time. Rather it was a human hive-world I was raised on.
The hind end of space. A pit of a world, to be sure. Where Jedi rarely tread...
But we had heard of them. Well, everyone had, so that is not to be unexpected.
Champions of truth. Defenders of justice. Heroes of the Republic.
It was very easy for a child to be enthralled by their image, their mystique. Maybe I was one of those children.
Allow children their innocence while they still may have it!
I was not so innocent, but I too was affected...
When I saw a Jedi for the first time they lived up to everything my imagination had created them to be. I was awed... and maybe a bit enamored...
From that moment on I knew that I would have to try to become a Jedi. To lift myself out of the rut I had been living in for years and to make a real difference, as the Jedi were.
The foolish delusions of a child. But THIS child made it happen!
As soon as I was able I left my world and went in search of them. I found them and was accepted. I had been living my dream on Dantooine for several years before you came.
Although... perhaps I was not entirely ready for it... or not completely suited to the task. Otherwise I would not have fallen...
But thanks to you I have been redeemed. Perhaps I may yet live to see that dream of mine come true.
Come, there is much we should do. Let us not waste time talking. Action is what is needed.
They were quite striking... especially the tales of their leader.
Yes... Yes I did.
There is little to tell. Dak and I were both Padawans... we joined the Order at the same time.
He was a kind man, but... frustrated. He felt the Jedi were too controlling, too limiting... more so than I did.
When he decided to leave the Order, he asked me to come with him. He... he said he loved me.
It was serious enough to him... and to me, for I did not wish to hurt him. I had little choice in the matter.
He was angry at my refusal. I... assumed that he would get over the hurt in time. I suppose such feelings can fester and darken, and they never go away.
He reminds me of what I was when you found me in the grove. I... feel sorry for him.
But he has chosen his path, hasn't he? If I thought he would accept an offer of help, I would give it. Let us... just move on, please.
I suppose the rest is obvious enough that I need not tell it.
No, I didn't. I enjoyed his company, as a friend, but nothing further. I had no idea he felt as he did.
I have heard of this world... Kashyyyk. It is a place of giant trees that have overgrown the entire world, blanketing it in greenery.
But while it is beautiful to behold at times, it can also be quite deadly. Many creatures and predators lurk in the leaves and branches. Some small, some undoubtedly quite large.
I have heard that the bottom layers of the trees have never been seen by a living being who returned to tell of it, and that travelling there is certain death. I do not envy any who go there.
It is most odd that Revan came here, but perhaps in the vast canopy of one of these trees we may find another piece of the Star Map.
I have heard of no indigenous race that inhabits this world, but I must profess my ignorance, since I have only heard its name in passing.
Tatooine is a filthy desert. Planets such as this should not be fit for life at all. My skin itches just to be here.
As you can see, it is a desert. Very little water. Too much sand. This sort of place attracts too much of the seedier side of civilization.
As to the particulars of this world itself, I can safely say that it holds no interest for me, and I will be well pleased when we leave here and never return.
Now is there something else, or may we hurry and do what we have to do here as quickly as possible?
Korriban, I have heard, is a mysterious world. It is rumored to hold many ancient ruins of a purpose that none have been able to discover.
There are also tales of strange ghosts and monsters haunting the ruins, whispering in the ears of all who would listen and driving them mad.
The Jedi are not welcome here, however, so we cannot determine the truth that may lie in these rumors.
Korriban remains staunchly outside the Republic, and we suspect that the Sith may have spread their influence here as well. The large Czerka Corporation outpost also points towards that.
If the Czerka Corp. is the industrial arms of the Sith Empire, then judging by the size of their facilities here, this may be a very dangerous world indeed.
We must watch ourselves closely here.
I am sorry, but I do not know anything about this place. It truly is an unknown world to me. I would be surprised if anyone at all in the Republic knew of it.
We should be on our guard at all times.
Manaan is a water-rich world... as you may have been able to tell.
With the exception of this Ahto city, there is no land on the world protruding above sea-level.
The dominant indigenous race of the world are the Selkath, a semi-aquatic bipedal species. They are known to be very dreary and strong proponents of the power of law above all else.
The extremist policies of the Sith seem to appeal to them. They have declared themselves neutral in this conflict between the Republic and the Sith.
The Selkath seek to preserve their independence by maintaining a stranglehold on the one unique resource of their world: the vulnerary liquid Kolto. The most powerful curative in the galaxy.
As the only world in the galaxy that produces Kolto, they have positioned themselves between the Sith and the Republic, supplying both sides with the medicine equally.
They hope in this way to make themselves too valuable to both to be conquered. As a last resort, they have made it clear to both sides that any attempt to attack their world will force them to destroy the Kolto supply entirely.
Any violation by either the Republic or the Sith of their sacrosanct laws incurs severe Kolto export restrictions on the violating government.
Both the Republic and the Sith try to keep the Selkath happy and give them no cause to complain. But I wonder how the Sith can take this affront to their power in stride...
Many people speak highly of the integrity of the Selkath people... but from what little I have seen of them, they are disgusting little fish-people. But I suppose I just have too high standards.
Dantooine? Dantooine has been my home for a number of years, ever since I started my training with the Jedi.
It is a lightly populated planet, mostly focused on agriculture and hunting of the wild beasts that roam its plains.
The most populous form of animals on its surface are the iriaz, herd beasts that are normally quite tame, but can be violent when provoked, and the kath hounds, vicious pack predators.
Kath hounds do not normally attack people except when it is a pack of them ambushing a lone individual. But recently they have been much more aggressive.
I am to blame for that, I believe.
But enough of my self-recrimination, I should not dwell on the past, but rather look to the future.
How may I be of further assistance to you, Padawan?
Yes? What is it?
Of course. I will assist you as I am able.
I am thinking of what happened on Korriban...
To see such horrible, warped rituals that the Sith practice... It is unnerving.
I can truly see now why we must defeat Malak as quickly as possible; to prevent that sort of society from consuming the entire galaxy.
It angers me to think of it.
Yes... yes, I understand: Do not let my passions and impulses rule me. Remain calm and serene.
But I fear that when I am confronted with these monsters I will lose myself.
I think that I may yet fall to the dark side by the very desire to fight it.
I know, I should not worry. I am grateful for your support in this matter.
It is a relief to have someone to turn to when I am feeling uncertain.
It seems that whenever I have a problem I turn to you. Sometimes... sometimes I almost seem to want problems, just for the chance...
But I am sorry, I should not speak of this.
Yes, it could be... if you look at it callously enough. But I cannot.
I am appalled at the things the Sith did there.
I cannot help but notice that your manner is increasingly like that of the Sith...
I am your companion. I am a fellow Jedi. I only seek to ensure the success of our mission.
But I do not believe it was. We should have been able to find another way.
I should have helped you find another path. I should have tried harder to stop you.
Maybe you should have... The fact that you think so gives me hope.
I hope that you will return to path of the Jedi... to me.
And I am sure that is exactly the same justification that Malak and Revan used before they fell...
Your overconfidence may yet be your downfall. I will still stand by your side, though.
I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.
I only wish that what I see meant more to you... that I could turn you back...
Will you try? ... For me?
Thank you. I am sure we can succeed together.
I... see.
I will still stand by you, as I have said before. I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.
I was remembering Taris...
You mock my pain! It was a horrible place to live... we had to go through hell every day just to survive, and you think it bothering me is an irritation?!
Your insensitivity speaks ill of your qualities as a Jedi. Still, as the Council ordered me to do, I shall accompany you, but expect no great sympathy for your plights.
It was a horrible place to have to live. At least in the lower cities where the non-humans tended to get relegated.
Living for years in a place with no sun, living off the trash dropped from the upper levels, and the meager pay doing back-breaking labor.
There were none. Bad enough to be a race that is feared and hated by humans, but to be one that is strange and different even among non-humans?
But living was hard enough without the stigma of being from a lost race.
There was always the danger of rakghouls coming up from the sewers, or more mundane predators living and working in the area.
My family and I struggled each and every day to make something of our lives, but we could only go so far.
Taxes from the corrupt government, more fees from the gangs controlling the streets, and whatever was left paying for what food and medical supplies we could afford.
It did not. But only because of the Jedi who came. It was very bad.
With no money to spare for any amenities, even the Enclave on Dantooine seems a paradise in comparison.
And of course there was the constant bigotry and hate from the more affluent and human citizens. Lording their wealth over us living below.
Every once in a while a rich human would come down through the lower levels with his droid entourage just to see how the 'wildlife' lived... and laughed at the mockeries that were our successes.
But I have come to meet many decent humans in my travels since those days. Indeed, some of the greatest people I have ever met are human.
I have noticed that. But the Jedi order seems to have collected a fair number.
Okay, you've made your point. Now shut up and kiss me, you fool!
The... the Jedi who encouraged me to join the Order, the one who was with the group going to fight the Mandalorians, she was human.
I... I suppose I see something of her in you when I look...
I am sorry... I am getting away from my point. If there even was one...
Sometimes I curse the day my parents fled to Taris. But then again, if they had not, I would not be where I am today.
Another story for another time. For now we must continue our own epic: To save the galaxy, if we can.
No, it is alright. I think I am over the worst of it. I apologize again for lashing out at you. It was not your fault.
I... have been bothered by something of late...
Someone else is not responsible for wiping out my homeworld by their actions. But who cares if it is because of you that everyone I have ever known off Dantooine is dead!
Someone else is not responsible for wiping out my homeworld by their actions. But who cares if it is because of you that everyone I have ever known off Dantooine is dead!
Fine! Then I will not! What does it matter to you if my homeworld was wiped out by your actions! Who cares if it is because of you that everyone I knew as a child is dead!
Taris! It was Taris that the Sith destroyed to try to kill you and your precious Bastila! Taris, my homeworld! Not that you care!
You... you animal! It is only because of the Council's will that I stay with you. But if you betray us, I may decide that falling to the dark side will be a small price to pay for letting my anger run loose.
Taris! It was Taris that the Sith destroyed to try to kill you and your precious Bastila! Taris, my homeworld!
It was my home!
The sacrifice of an entire world is too much for any cause! How would you feel if Dantooine or Alderaan or somesuch world were destroyed?
Would you be so callous then?
Oh yes, I have been told all about her vaunted powers with the Force. Her Battle Meditation that can turn the tide of any conflict.
Well if it could, then why could Taris not have been saved?
What did you think would happen by aiding the Republic?
If it were not for you and Bastila, the Sith would have never had reason to destroy that world! It was your fault for being there, and your fault for rescuing Bastila!
Without your intervention the Sith would have had no cause to lay waste to my childhood!
Just let me vent my anger! I need someone to blame... something... anything!
I hated that world, yet everything I learned as a child I learned there. It is as much a part of me as the air I breathe.
I have this ache inside me where all my childhood memories lay, and I find your face there with them. If it was not for you, that world would still exist!
There is no emotion. There is peace.
... I suppose you did what you had to... and it could not have been avoided. The Republic needs you and Bastila. Maybe needs you more than it needed Taris.
I... I know... I suppose I realized that.
But it is so hard to lose your entire past. You would not understand.
I suppose that is to be expected. Everything will turn out for the best as long as we remain focused on our task.
Yes... Yes I suppose it will. As long as we remain focused on our task it will.
I am sorry. I will try not to distract you in the future with my trivial experiences. We should stop for now.
I never told you where I came from, did I? Where I grew up as a child? I suppose I was trying to deny what I was feeling.
You self centered fool! To think that I would desire to mate with one such as you, should that even be possible!
You are the center of the universe, what does it matter if my homeworld was wiped out by your actions! Who cares if it is because of you that everyone I knew as a child is dead!
I have been wrestling with my feelings inside. Trying to come to terms with it, but I find I cannot. I must have someone to blame!
Someone to blame for the destruction of my homeworld. Someone who is responsible for the death of everyone I have ever known except those on Dantooine!
I have heard of this world... Kashyyyk. It is a place of giant trees that have overgrown the entire world, blanketing it in greenery.
But while it is beautiful to behold at times, it can also be quite deadly. Many creatures and predators lurk in the leaves and branches. Some small, some undoubtedly quite large.
I have heard that the bottom layers of the trees have never been seen by a living being who returned to tell of it, and that travelling there is certain death. I do not envy any who go there.
It is most odd that Revan came here, but perhaps in the vast canopy of one of these trees we may find another piece of the Star Map.
I have heard of no indigenous race that inhabits this world, but I must profess my ignorance, since I have only heard its name in passing.
Tatooine is a filthy desert. Planets such as this should not be fit for life at all. My skin itches just to be here.
As you can see, it is a desert. Very little water. Too much sand. This sort of place attracts too much of the seedier side of civilization.
As to the particulars of this world itself, I can safely say that it holds no interest for me, and I will be well pleased when we leave here and never return.
Now is there something else, or may we hurry and do what we have to do here as quickly as possible?
Korriban, I have heard, is a mysterious world. It is rumored to hold many ancient ruins of a purpose that none have been able to discover.
There are also tales of strange ghosts and monsters haunting the ruins, whispering in the ears of all who would listen and driving them mad.
The Jedi are not welcome here, however, so we cannot determine the truth that may lie in these rumors.
Korriban remains staunchly outside the Republic, and we suspect that the Sith may have spread their influence here as well. The large Czerka Corporation outpost also points towards that.
If the Czerka Corp. is the industrial arms of the Sith Empire, then judging by the size of their facilities here, this may be a very dangerous world indeed.
We must watch ourselves closely here.
I am sorry, but I do not know anything about this place. It truly is an unknown world to me. I would be surprised if anyone at all in the Republic knew of it.
We should be on our guard at all times.
Manaan is a water-rich world... as you may have been able to tell.
With the exception of this Ahto city, there is no land on the world protruding above sea-level.
The dominant indigenous race of the world are the Selkath, a semi-aquatic bipedal species. They are known to be very dreary and strong proponents of the power of law above all else.
The extremist policies of the Sith seem to appeal to them. They have declared themselves neutral in this conflict between the Republic and the Sith.
The Selkath seek to preserve their independence by maintaining a stranglehold on the one unique resource of their world: the vulnerary liquid Kolto. The most powerful curative in the galaxy.
As the only world in the galaxy that produces Kolto, they have positioned themselves between the Sith and the Republic, supplying both sides with the medicine equally.
They hope in this way to make themselves too valuable to both to be conquered. As a last resort, they have made it clear to both sides that any attempt to attack their world will force them to destroy the Kolto supply entirely.
Any violation by either the Republic or the Sith of their sacrosanct laws incurs severe Kolto export restrictions on the violating government.
Both the Republic and the Sith try to keep the Selkath happy and give them no cause to complain. But I wonder how the Sith can take this affront to their power in stride...
Many people speak highly of the integrity of the Selkath people... but from what little I have seen of them, they are disgusting little fish-people. But I suppose I just have too high standards.
Dantooine? Dantooine has been my home for a number of years, ever since I started my training with the Jedi.
It is a lightly populated planet, mostly focused on agriculture and hunting of the wild beasts that roam its plains.
The most populous form of animals on its surface are the iriaz, herd beasts that are normally quite tame, but can be violent when provoked, and the kath hounds, vicious pack predators.
Kath hounds do not normally attack people except when it is a pack of them ambushing a lone individual. But recently they have been much more aggressive.
I am to blame for that, I believe.
But enough of my self-recrimination, I should not dwell on the past, but rather look to the future.
Is there anything else you need?
I have been thinking about our journey together, and how we are more similar than I had first thought.
Heh. I did not mean in appearances, but we have had some of the same experiences.
But similar enough. We have had many of the same sort of experiences.
I know how hard it was for me to resist the call of the dark side, and I know that you have suffered those pains as well.
The continual struggle between restraint and freedom... light and darkness. It is hard for me with my Cathar blood to resist sometimes.
I do resist. I look to you and see that we are in this together, and that you are resisting as well. That gives me strength.
I think the Jedi Council would be proud to see that you are holding up so well in spite of the hardships you have endured.
... As am I.
I... I have been watching you for some time. I wonder if you have noticed.
I have been thinking of how far I had fallen, and how you exemplify the Code of the Jedi. I find my self ashamed.
Your power in the Force is strong, and I can sense no taint of the dark side in you. That makes my shame even worse...
But I have so little to show when I compare myself to you... and that makes my shame even worse...
That I had so easily fallen to the dark side. That I could convince myself that by injuring my master I became a great force of evil in the galaxy.
For my pride, my hubris. For the inner rage that all of my species feels. Sometimes I wish that I had not been born this way...
I am sorry. I start to talk thinking about how you stay strong to the path of virtue and justice, and I find myself whining again about my own inadequacies.
The Council would be proud to see that you had learned your lessons so well.
... As am I.
I have been watching you... and I cannot help but feel that you are becoming more distant.
When we met it was you that convinced me to turn away from the lure of the dark side. But now it seems that you are falling into the trap that had caught me.
No. Please. I must speak.
When we first met I looked at you with contempt. You were some insect sent by the Jedi Council to eliminate me.
But you were more powerful than I would ever have thought. It seemed so easy for you to overcome me.
And this is just the problem! You seem to revel in your power, use it far too frequently for your own gain.
I... I do not know... I fear that you may be starting to fall.
I wonder if it started when you met me in that grove. I wonder if it could be my fault.
Maybe I do. I have had reason to wonder recently if I have had any effect at all...
I wish I could believe that as you do.
That is true. But still I worry about the ones you make.
But I have faith in you. I would follow you into battle with Malak himself. I will stand by your side.
If only there were some way I could turn you away from the path that you seem to be headed down...
That you did. You took away the dark taint that had been consuming me and restored me to the light. You took me away from there.
But now... now I wonder what it is that you see in your own reflection.
I look and I see you turning away from the Code of the Jedi. I wonder if you can see it.
I think that you flatter me again, and I do not know why. I worry for you.
I felt statisfaction taking revenge for my people like that... but... but I should not have let my anger consume me so.
No I didn't. I let my anger and passion consume me and did something rash. Something which leads me down the path to the dark side.
But... I recognize this, and I am truly regretful that I committed this act. I shall not let it happen again.
I suppose I was fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.
Yes... Yes I do. I must try harder in the future to resist such urges. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.
We should continue on our way. I do not want to linger around here anymore.
But I could have! I should have...
I must try harder in the future to resist the call of the dark side. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.
That man was a beast! A monster! I am glad that the galaxy is now rid of him, so that he may not harm others again.
I do regret, though, that he did not die by my hand...
I... I do not know anymore what I am strong enough for. I only take what comes to me and hope that I can handle it.
The lure of the dark side will always be my strongest foe. I should have killed him.
I know. But must I always fear the lure of the dark side?
But... it was for the best. I am glad that you stood by my side during this.
We should continue our journeys now. No reason for staying here for this.
My Cathar blood seethes at the thought of that man still running free. I cannot stand still while I think about it, but... but I will not give in to the dark side either.
He will pay for his crimes, though. He will most likely be following us... me. If we could find him first, then he may not be able to set in motion whatever he has in store for us.
So here we are... in the belly of the beast.
How... reassuring. I, though, would not have liked to die quite so soon.
We are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi. I am not favoring of our chances.
Here we are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi, and you wonder at my apprehension?
Knowledge of the almost certainty of my death tends to make me introspective.
If I am going to die here then, I am glad to have stood by you.
Yes. Yes, we should. Your focus on your work does you credit.
Let us leave this place then... If we can.
Live or die, I shall stand by you as you need me.
I only wish that we had had more time... together...
It is too late to do anything now. We must do what we can to escape from here.
When we have left, perhaps then we can see what the future holds for us.
I do not favor our chances at all. But if you believe that we can... then maybe there is a possibility.
Live or die, I shall stand by you as you need me.
I wish that I had more time to turn you from the path you seem to have chosen.
I hope that is true. Truly, I do.
But you have also fallen far from the ideals of the Jedi Order. Can you still do what is required of you?
Your steadfast desire for vengeance credits your perseverence, but I fear for you. It is too easy to give in completely to the dark side.
I know I worry too much, and I know you may be irritated by my saying this, but do not fall the way I did. You have so much potential, I do not want you to waste it.
But there is enough to worry about without my making it worse. Perhaps we can speak more of this later, once we leave this ship.
Your conviction is... compelling. But also disturbing.
If you will not listen to me, then to who? I admire you greatly, and respect your abilities...
If you will not listen to me, then to who? I respect your abilities, and I... I care for you...
I wonder if that is true. For your sake, I hope that it is.
This may be the last time I will have a chance to talk to you...
I just want to thank you for all that you have done for me. For saving me from the dark side, for accepting me on your journey.
I will help you in any way I can.
It is good to know that I have been of some value...
I will prove my true worth to you.
We WILL defeat Malak and save the Republic from the Sith threat once and for all!
I... defer to your wisdom in this matter. I have little knowledge of the true power of the Sith.
I pledge my life to your cause. I will stand by you until the end.
Even if not as much as I would like...
I just want you to know that I... that I...
Of.. Of course. I am sorry. I should have known better.
I can only say that if I am going to die, as we stand likely to, I am glad that it will be you beside whom I do it.
But I feel I must. I have never said this before...
I... I... I care for you. I do not know why. I do not know if anything will be possible or if you even return what I feel, but I do know it is there.
I am sorry if this upsets you. I am so sorry if I am wrong, but I cannot deny what it is that I feel.
I was afraid that I would have no more time to say it... I wonder if all of us wil survive what we must do...
I... I understand. You have someone somewhere... or I just do not seem to appeal to you.
I am sorry for pushing myself on you. I apologize for my actions.
I suggest we find and confront Malak as soon as possible to remove the threat to the Republic once and for all.
Now that I have put myself in this position, I know not what to say.
Yes. I thank you.
But as much as I may care for you, and you for me, first we must deal with Malak.
After there will be time to sort things out between us.
Yes. I thank you.
How... how can you possibly be Revan?
I knew when I heard that you had become the Dark Lord of the Sith that something was wrong with it.
The woman who saved me, who I... who I have come to admire, could never go completely to the dark side.
It is good to know that you have truly changed. It gives me hope.
I do not think now that I will fall to the dark side. I only have to look to you and follow by your example and there is no way I can fail.
I... I am sorry, I did not realize. I will endeavor to be more considerate in the future.
That is especially meaningful coming from you.
Thank you for placing your confidence in me. I only wish I had your heart as well...
I will never forget what you did for me, even if you do not remember it.
Yes. That is true. I suppose you would know better than I.
The woman who saved me, who I... I have come to care for, could never go completely to the dark side.
The man who saved me could never go completely to the dark side.
You are nothing like the one who saved me on Taris.
You are obviously not who I thought you were, once upon a time.
I thought you were the ideal Jedi. I thought you would never turn against us. Yet here you are.
You did turn in the end. I did not want to believe it. But now I suppose you have a chance to redeem yourself.
You can work with us. For the Republic. For the Order. We can set right what you started so long ago.
Only through serving the Republic do you serve yourself as well. In defeating Malak you save all of us along with you.
And I hope that what you see as necessary is what we originally set out to do.
Yes we shall. I only hope that you will see this through until the end.
Time will tell what choices you make. I shall stay by you to see this task done.
The one... the Jedi whose troops saved me on Taris... It was Revan, leading an army out to defeat the Mandalorians. It was you...
I feel I must apologize for the way I acted towards you before, in the grove. It was wrong of me.
I realize you have justification, but that anger only leads to the dark side. Please do not fall into the same trap that caught me.
I thought that too. But I was wrong...
The dark side is most devious and deceptive. It can find the smallest weakness to exploit.
I am sorry for attacking you. I am sorry for thinking you would only try to kill me.
I hope that by helping you in your task I may redeem myself in your eyes... and in my own.
You mock me! I will do what it takes to redeem myself in the eyes of my peers. I WILL succeed!
I will prove myself to you and to everyone! I will be a faithful companion to you and Bastila as long as our journey may last.
It may. But I am prepared to do what it takes.
I can only hope that, in our time journeying together, I will succeed.
Thank you... It is most reassuring to know that you can forgive me, even though I tried to take your life.
There is no time to talk now. Our priority is to find what caused this disturbance in the Force. It is close by, I know that much.
Nothing for now. Perhaps later.
I was wondering if we could talk.
Why are you so hostile towards Canderous?
You're delusional.
I am suspicious as well.
Perhaps we will have to eliminate him, then.
Fear and hate are lures of the dark side.
Do not become paranoid, Juhani.
Should I speak to him?
Have you spoken to him?
A cowardly, but rational choice.
A wise decision. We do not need internal conflict.
Just... that you are a coward. Why deny it?
You are afraid?
Just?
I would not let him harm you, Juhani.
I may be forced to strike you down, should you fall.
You should not worry. You can over your anger.
About what?
I think you will come to trust him in time.
Hatred and fear lead to the dark side, Juhani.
What?? Aren't the Cathar such fierce warriors?
You should not judge Canderous by other Mandalorians.
Canderous has proven himself.
He has proven himself well.
Wary? Why?
What are you thinking about?
How so?
Well you have to admit: You are a freak.
I find it a little hard to believe.
Humans can be just as cruel to each other.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying something important?
Wait a second. Why are you telling me all this?
You're right. Don't bother me with this drivel again.
It is interesting... I just fail to see the point.
No, it is alright. I will be here to listen to you whenever you want.
You are not weak, Juhani. It must have been hard.
Life is hard. You can't blame everything on other people.
I know some parts are bad, but...
Then you should be right at home when I turn my back on you.
And how are things different now?
You could try counting on one of the others, you know...
We are all in this together.
It is nice that you hold me in such high regard.
It's only because I haven't found out how to ditch you yet.
It must have been difficult for you.
Tell me about your people.
Are you doing alright?
Well you know my reputation.
There's a reason for these things, you know.
What do you want to know?
It is a little forward...
Heh. Well it is, of course, the greatest story ever told.
Is is not a very interesting story.
What is there to tell...
Damn right! It's none of your business!
Sorry, my life is my business.
No, it is alright.
Er... I flew to Dantooine?
I was in the Republic fleet that was destroyed over Taris.
Well I rescued Bastila on Taris...
I was a scout for the Republic armed forces.
I was a soldier for the Republic.
I was a specialist with the Republic fleet.
You're too fragile, Juhani.
Perhaps you just need more time.
Great, another mouth to feed...
If I see you begin to slip back, I will intervene.
I cannot afford to look after you all the time, Juhani.
Why? What is wrong?
You know, I don't really think I care very much.
If the taint cannot be removed, are you sure you should be here?
What happened after your father died?
Could you not help her?
What happened?
How so?
Surely there was a doctor.
What did you do for her?
Did she die?
They captured you?
You were enslaved?
Mmm... livestock, eh?
How could the Jedi stand for that?
And they freed you?
What was the dream?
What did you do?
You turned away from the dark side.
You became a Jedi.
Juhani...
Tell me more about your past.
Why would I react badly?
Do we really have time for this?
What is it?
Of course I remember.
Yes, you mentioned this.
How bad could this be?
Spit it out already!
Well what?
How could you admire Revan?
Revan?! You mean...
Why did you tell me now?
I shall never fall like Revan did!
Juhani...
There were no Cathar on Taris that I saw.
Why were there no other members of your species on Taris?
Why did they flee?
Go on.
Please do.
What caused them to flee?
Your people were in that region?
Near the world your species comes from?
The Mandalorians fought dirty.
Your world was taken that easily?
How did it happen?
And that is what you get for being unprepared.
The Jedi could have helped!
Why did the Republic not help you?
An atrocity!
What about your family?
But you survived?
Taris is not a nice place to raise a child.
Your parents do not sound very wise to me.
How did your family cope?
That's tragic...
How did he die?
He died?
Why do you insist on spewing this trash at me?
I already know about Jedi, talk about something else.
Invigorating?
Blah, blah, blah. Okay, you can stop now.
What do you mean?
Tragic?
If that was the case, they seem to be misrepresenting themselves.
Damn straight! I DO look divine.
The Jedi are not gods.
Did they leave?
What happened?
All species are capable of intolerance.
Well you can't really blame them.
It is alright.
Such anger can lead to the dark side.
As long as you do not let your anger influence you.
Was it that bad?
How did you come to be a Jedi?
You're right. It's going to be boring.
On second thought, maybe not.
Yes. Please continue.
Was it bad there?
What is the Cathar homeworld like?
Where did you live?
Typical childish naivete.
So what did you do?
The imagination can be a dangerous thing...
Enamored?
Then how did you gain entrance to the Order?
Did you meet a Jedi?
Tell me about this Dak Vesser.
That doesn't sound so serious.
Oh. Forget I asked.
But you didn't love him?
What do you know about this world?
Yeah, well evil always wins in the end anyway.
The Sith seem to have all the advantages.
Neutral? Can they not see the Sith are evil?
Nothing right now. Maybe later.
Is something wrong?
We are doing our job. Do not make it personal.
You should not keep worrying like this.
Do not fear, Juhani.
Now that's irony.
It angers me as well.
Do not give in to your anger.
I'm in charge and I'll do what I want.
Who are you to criticize me?!
What I did was necessary.
Maybe I should have done differently.
I tire of your criticism.
This is war. We do not have time for niceties.
I recognize the danger.
I will prove stronger than them!
I am not Revan!
I will try, Juhani.
No. I am sorry.
Get out of my face!
Not this again...
What about it?
I do not remember seeing any of your race on Taris...
That's horrible!
How did you survive?
And those rakghouls...
How could such a government last?
No one would help you?
Was it that bad?
Decent humans are hard to find.
One of the Jedi you met?
Like who?
And how did you arrive on Dantooine?
Fled? Fled from where?
Your parents?
I am sorry, Juhani.
You sure someone else can't help you?
Don't lay all your problems on me.
*Yawn*
What are you saying?
You mean...
I thought you hated your homeworld...
Sometimes you need to make some sacrifices.
Well... yeah, probably.
Bastila is critical to defeating the Sith.
I did not know the Sith would destroy Taris.
I am sorry, Juhani, I did not know.
We...
But...
I...
I have no excuse. I did what I needed to.
Calm yourself. Remember the Jedi Code.
I am sorry, Juhani. There was no way to prevent it.
You're right. I don't.
It will be alright, Juhani.
What is it?
You want to go someplace quiet to... get it on?
Are you hitting on me?
What?
What do you know about this world?
Yeah, well evil always wins in the end anyway.
The Sith seem to have all the advantages.
Neutral? Can they not see the Sith are evil?
I am nothing like you!
We are not that similar...
How so?
Do not force me to have to kill you.
Remain strong!
You must not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.
I am not so great as that.
You should not be so hard on yourself.
Ashamed?
You cannot change how you were born.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
You should not think that way.
Shut the h...
Wha... ?
Juhani...
Yes, it was.
You overestimate your effect on me.
No, of course not.
We each make our own choices, Juhani.
My mission was only to cleanse the grove.
You were more of a challenge than you think.
You did the right thing.
At least you regret it.
You couldn't help it.
You weren't strong enough to do it.
What you did was best.
It would have been wrong.
I will not let them take me.
Do not worry, we will escape.
What is wrong?
Less talk, more escaping.
And I am glad to have had you by my side.
You are making me uncomfortable...
We will have time.
Juhani...
Do not worry, Juhani. We will escape.
We will have all the time in the world, Juhani.
I can do anything. Starting with destroying this ship.
When I get out of here, I will hunt Malak down like a dog.
I WILL defeat Malak!
I do not need you to judge me.
The choices I have made were necessary
You have proved your worth many times over.
I need you to help me, Juhani.
I value your companionship.
Do not underestimate the Sith.
We should get going.
And that is what we shall do!
Please stop. Now.
You do not need to say it, Juhani.
... Yes?
Are you sure this is the time for this?
I am sorry, I cannot return your affection.
I feel the same way, Juhani.
We have gone past words.
Er... 'Thank you'?
You do not have to say anything.
Perhaps she had her reasons. But I do not.
You flatter me...
You will do fine, Juhani.
Overconfidence can also lead to the dark side.
I do not know who that Revan was. I am not her.
Perhaps he had his reasons. But I do not.
I do not know who that Revan was. I am not him.
I regret any of the harm I may have caused.
People change.
You know nothing of me!
I am who I am, Juhani.
I AM the ideal Jedi.
I do not make excuses for my actions.
Here I am.
I work for myself!
I will do what is necessary.
We shall see.
Next time you try something like that, I'll kill you.
Have no fear, I recognize the danger.
The dark side will not take me! I am too strong!
I am not as weak as you, Juhani.
Damn right! Apologize!
Ha! Unlikely.
I think it's going to take a lot for that to happen.
Do not worry, Juhani. I forgive you.
You thought the dark side had consumed you. It is nothing.
Mission? Is that you? It's me, Lena. Remember? I was dating your brother back on Taris!
Lena? What... what are you doing here? Where's Griff?
I'm just passing through. Griff and I broke up a few months after we left Taris together. Probably for the best. Your brother can be charming, Mission, but he's bad news.
Don't you start trashing my brother, you cantina rat! Take that back or I'll smack you so hard your head-tails will pop off!
Wha-?? Mission, what's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
Yeah, I know how she feels. Griff can be pretty frustrating. I guess that's why Mission didn't want to come with us when we left Taris.
You've got your facts a little backwards. Mission could have come with us if she wanted to! It was her choice to stay behind!
You liar! Griff told me you didn't want his little sister tagging along - that's why he had to leave me behind!
Is that what the Hutt-spawn told you? I wanted you to come with us, Mission. I even offered to pay for your ticket! Why not? I paid for everything else while I was with that freeloader.
But he told me you didn't want to leave Taris. I said we shouldn't even go then, but he said we'd come back and get you after we struck it rich on Tatooine - just another one of his lies!
No - you're the one who's lying! Griff wouldn't... he wouldn't try to leave me behind!
Think about it. If Griff wasn't trying to ditch you, Mission, then why didn't he tell you where we were going?
After we left Taris he told me looking after you was holding him back - Griff's always looking to blame other people for his own problems. That's why he abandoned you.
He did the same thing to me, too, as soon as I ran out of money. He started blaming me for all his problems. Like it's my fault his get-rich-quick schemes never work out!
But Griff is my brother! I can't just pretend he doesn't exist! If he was here to defend himself Lena wouldn't be saying all this bad stuff about him!
Still on Tatooine, as far as I know. Not that I really care anymore. And if Mission was smart she'd forget about that no-good con artist!
Hey, if you want to talk to Griff go ahead. Last I heard he was going to make a fortune working the Czerka Corp mines on Tatooine. But as far as I'm concerned he's out of my life forever!
Griff's better off without you anyway, you table-dancing, brother-stealing home wrecker!
*sigh* I guess that's my cue to leave, then. I didn't mean to upset you, Mission. But one day you'll see I'm right about your brother. I only hope it's not too late by then.
You damn well know it! He's nothing but a sleazy scam artist. If Mission knew what was good for her she'd forget he ever existed.
Mission gets a little worked up when it comes to her brother.
You took her brother away and left her all alone on Taris!
Maybe your brother isn't the man you thought he was.
Maybe he thought you were better off on Taris, Mission.
This isn't my problem.
So where is Griff now?
I'd like to hear Griff's side of things before I judge him.
Sounds like you're better off without him.
Why should we believe you, Lena?
Excuse me... I know it's been a very long time, dear, but aren't you Bastila, Helena's little girl? Yes - it is you! I can see it in the eyes. My how you've grown!
I am Bastila, yes. I take it that you know my mother?
Oh, yes. I worked for your father on an expedition years ago. Your mother showed me holos of you before you... well, before you left. Such a pretty little girl you were.
Is there something I can do for you, miss? As you can see, we are in quite a hurry.
Oh, I didn't mean to take up your time. I just wanted to ask you if your mother's condition has improved any since I saw her.
My mother's condition?
Oh, you... you don't know? Oh, dear. I just thought... I assumed that she had found you. When I talked to her last, she was desperate to find you...
I have not seen my mother since I joined the order. Do you know what has happened? Did she... say anything about my father?
I'm sorry, dear, but your mother is very ill. So she told me. She didn't say anything about your father, however. I didn't see him.
I see. Where did you meet her, do you remember?
I saw her on Tatooine, dear. She said she'd been there for awhile. Maybe she's still there?
Thank you for informing me. I really must be going, now.
It seems my mother has been looking for me. Strange. Should we get the opportunity, could we look for her on Tatooine?
I agree. Should we get the chance, however, I would speak to her. Perhaps it has something to do with my father.
It is important enough that my mother was attempting to seek me out. Perhaps it has something to do with my father.
We never did. I am interested in hearing about my father, however.
Part of me would rather not see her at all. But if she is really sick... well, we shall see.
What's this all about?
Forget it. We've got better things to do.
Certainly, if you think it's important.
I thought you and your mother didn't get along?
Umm... are you sure you want to ask me about that?
Oh, heck, I don't know.
Hey, there. What can I do for you?
Okay... have it your way.
I want to thank you for helping me with Griff. You... you did everything you could for my brother. More than most people would have.
I know it might look like it didn't make any difference in the end... Griff's in debt and on the run like usual. But at least I know we tried to help him.
I can't say I blame you. But I'll be honest... I doubt you'll ever see Griff again. I don't even know if I'll ever see him again. Like all good con men he knows how to disappear.
My brother is what he is, but I've learned to deal with that. I'll never forget that he looked after me when I was just a kid, but I don't feel like I owe him anything anymore.
I've made my peace with Griff and what he means to me. If he ever shows up again I'll deal with him, but I'm not going to dwell on my brother anymore. It's time to move forward!
Don't worry, I see all Griff's faults plainly now. None of us is perfect, but I realize he's a little less perfect than most.
I know people can change no matter how bad they were. But I'm not holding my breath. None of us is perfect, but I've come to realize that Griff is a little less perfect than most.
I appreciate everything you've done for Griff. You know that, right? I just hope things work out for him this time around.
I guess we'll find out when he meets up with us at the Czerka Corp shop. If he's got those credtis he promised you then maybe there's hope for him yet.
Hey, if you want to help him with this Tarisian ale scheme that's your business. I'm washing my hands of the whole thing.
I'm worried about Griff and his latest plan. I've got a bad feeling about it. He doesn't know anything about brewing Tarisian ale.
And now he's gotten himself mixed up with the Exchange. Sometimes Griff can be so stupid! Part of me just wants to let him get what's coming to him.
Maybe a couple broken knee-caps will do him some good! Maybe that's the kind of jolt he needs to turn his life around! Only... what if they do something worse?
They might kill him! I don't want him to die; he doesn't deserve that. But I can't just keep supporting his crazy schemes. Someone has to teach him a lesson!
You're right! Griff may be my brother, but he deserted me on Taris. As far as I'm concerned that pretty much breaks any bond we had!
I'm not going to worry about Griff anymore. Like you said, he brought this on himself! Besides, he's always treated me like garbage. Now it's payback time!
Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm not going to change him. Griff is going to keep on being Griff.
Maybe if we get these tach glands for him things will work out. Or maybe he'll finally see the light and turn over a new leaf. I know it's not likely, but it's all I have to hope for.
Why not? He turned his back on me! He abandoned me on Taris, so maybe I should just leave him high and dry now!
Look, I'm happy Griff's alive but I'm mad at him right now. And I don't know what kind of job he's got for you, but I don't trust him. It's probably just another scam!
Talk? What is there to talk about? Those sandpeople took my brother prisoner!
Griff may be a slime but we have to go rescue him! We can't just leave him with those... those... those monsters!
I know you're out to save the galaxy and all. But you can't just turn your back on someone who needs your help - you're a Jedi, not a Sith!
I can't make you go after my brother, but you're the only one who can save him. Just think about it, that's all I ask. In the end I know you'll do the right thing.
You heard the Czerka rep: the sandpeople sometimes take prisoners. Say what you want about Griff, but he's a survivor. I know he's still alive.
I knew I could count on you! There's definite fringe benefits to being friends with a Jedi!
I've been thinking about Lena and what she said about Griff. You know, how he was always blaming other people for his problems. There might be something to what she said.
No, of course not. Not really. But what if... what if it was his idea to leave me behind? I'm not saying Griff would just abandon me.
But maybe... maybe he did want to leave me behind. Just temporarily, you know? He might have done that, if he planned on coming back later.
But things didn't usually work out for Griff the way he planned, you know? And that's when he'd get in trouble. He was always borrowing money he could never pay back.
He might have been trying to skip out on his debts when he left Taris. He would have had to leave his little sister behind so it would look like he was coming back.
Yeah... well, no. Not exactly. Look, all I'm trying to say is that the more I think back the more I realize I might be idolizing my brother a bit. Not seeing all his faults.
I still want to find him. I need to see him again. It's just that I'm not sure how I'll react when I do.
Maybe. We'll see. I don't... I don't want to judge him yet. Maybe Lena was lying. Or maybe... maybe she wasn't.
All I know is I'd like to speak to Griff myself. If we have time, I'd like to go talk to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine and see what he has to say about where my brother is now.
Don't tell me you believe Lena's lies? Griff might be working as a miner on Tatooine, but the rest of her story is bantha poo-doo! You can't trust someone like her.
At least Griff's free of her clutches. I'd like to go speak to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine, if we have time. Maybe I can arrange to see my brother again.
Sure, I understand. Saving the galaxy and all. All I'm saying is if we get time to make a quick sidetrip to Tatooine... look, just think about it, okay?
I just hope he's not in any kind of trouble when we do.
I'm sorry for the way I acted before. It's just that when it comes to Lena I tend to get a little worked up.
My brother and me had a good thing going. Sure, Griff had his run-ins with the law on Taris. But we got by okay. Until Lena came and ruined everything.
She was a dancer at the cantina where my brother used to go to play Pazaak. Griff could be a real smooth talker, and it wasn't long before the two of them were dating.
But Lena was used to dating rich Tarisian nobles - guys with mountains of credits. Griff could never give her the kind of lifestyle she was used to, no matter how hard he worked.
I'm not going to pretend Griff wasn't a hustler and a con-artist, but that doesn't mean you can just insult him! He did what he did to look out for me!
I thought Lena would brush Griff off when she saw how poor he was, but for some reason she stuck around. I guess she saw the potential for a big payday down the road.
I saw Lena for what she really was - a busty, credit-grubbing cantina rat! She used Griff and took away the only family I had!
After they'd been together for a few months, Griff told me he was leaving Taris. He and Lena were going to try and make their fortune off-world.
He promised as soon as he made enough credits he'd come back and get me and we'd all live like royalty. That was two years ago - I haven't seen him since! I don't even know where he went!
Oh, I know what happened! As soon as she got him off Taris Lena sunk her claws into Griff but good! She twisted him around her little finger and made him forget all about me!
I know I'll probably never see Griff again. But part of the reason I came with you was the hope that I could find out what happened to my brother.
Don't worry - I won't let my search for Griff get in the way of what we're doing. Let's just get back to the task at hand. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I'm not really in the mood to talk about my brother right now. Maybe we should just stay focused on the job at hand, you know?
So, is there anything else you need?
I... I was a little snappish when we last talked. I'm sorry about that. I get a little touchy when it comes to Griff. It's kind of embarassing telling people about him.
Right, sure. I understand. We've got all this other stuff going on what with the Sith and all. You're busy. No problem. Maybe later we can talk. When you have more time, you know?
No, I want to tell you. Zaalbar's a great listener but it might be nice to talk about this with someone who doesn't reply in growls and grunts.
It's complicated. Griff wasn't the most popular guy, he had his faults. But I still loved him, you know? Sometimes people don't understand.
I never knew my parents, my brother always looked out for me. He's the one who brought me to Taris. I was just a kid, only five. But I remember the trip - if you could call it that.
We were stuffed inside a packing crate in a star freighter's cargo hold with just enough food and water to make the trip. Not exactly first class, you know?
Oh... yeah. I understand. We've got bigger bantha to hunt, right? I just miss Griff, is all. I keep thinking things might have been different, you know?
I don't know the whole story - I was pretty young. But my brother owed a lot of money. Might even have been a few arrest warrants out for him, I don't know.
The only way to get off the planet was to smuggle ourselves out. I mean, I don't want to make it sound like we were criminals... well, maybe my brother was.
See, this is why I don't like to talk about it. It makes Griff sound worse than he really was. My brother had his problems, but he always looked out for me.
He gambled. And drank. And he was always borrowing money for his latest get rich quick scheme. But he had a good heart, you know? He taught me how to survive.
He showed me how to slice into a computer's security system; how to get inside a locked building without the entrance codes, and how to spot a wealthy mark for a quick shell game.
Yeah, Griff did right by me.
Hey, you don't know what it's like! You need those skills here in the Lower City. Griff did right by me.
I really miss him since he left. I keep hoping he'll come back some day. He promised me he would.
Why do you got to go putting my brother down like that? That's just mean! Besides, it wasn't his idea to leave!
He fell in with a bad crowd. It's all Lena's fault. She's the one who took him from me! Just batted those long lashes at him and off he went!
Mission - mission: is that supposed to be a joke? Like I've only heard that about a million times in my life! Okay, I can take a hint. You don't want to hear anymore. That's just fine.
I don't want to talk about Griff and Lena - just the thought of that space tramp makes my blood boil! Subject's closed as far as I'm concerned!
If I'm going to be any help to you I can't be worrying about my brother running off with some intergalactic skank! So, is there something else you need?
Yeah - that's what I'm trying to say! Without my brother I don't know where I'd be.
Shouldn't we be more worried about getting Zaalbar back from those Wookiees? I don't trust that Chuundar character.
Really? You want to know about me? Nobody's ever really been interested in me before. What did you want to know?
Big Z's my family, you know? My parents... well, I guess they're dead. It was just me on my own until the day I saw Zaalbar in the Lower City. I could tell right away he was in trouble.
This was before the gang wars were out of hand, but even then the Vulkars were scum. A few of them were hassling Big Z, trying to pick a fight - but he wasn't looking for trouble.
Fine - I won't tell how Zaalbar and I hooked up. Sheesh! First you ask about it, then you say you don't want to hear it! You're as bad as my brother used to be!
My brother's a touchy subject, you know? It just so happens I don't really feel like talking about him right now. Nothing personal. Let's just get back to the business at hand, okay?
Anyway, I don't like Vulkars at the best of times. And when I saw them picking on this poor Wookiee - all alone on a strange planet, overwhelmed by the big city - I just lost it.
I screamed out 'Leave him alone, you core-slimes!' and charged right at them. One of them saw me coming and slapped me so hard he just about knocked me cold.
Hey - don't treat me like I'm a little girl! I ain't no kid - I'm fourteen years old!
Those Vulkars didn't scare me. They're nothing but cowards. I knew how to deal with them. Of course, I never got the chance.
I guess Zaalbar didn't like seeing me get smacked around. He let out this howl and yanked that Vulkar a meter up off the ground and held him there by his throat.
Are you kidding? Big Z ain't like that! He's just a big old softie inside. Of course, the Vulkars didn't know that.
The other two screamed and ran off. Can't say I blame them. The first time you see an angry Wookiee up close it isn't a pretty sight.
I thought Zaalbar was going to rip that punk's arms off and beat him to death with his own fists. The Vulkar was so scared he fainted. Or maybe Big Z's breath just knocked him out.
I keep telling Zaalbar to brush those choppers of his, but he never listens. Just stay upwind when he's speaking and you'll be fine.
Anyway, I knew those Vulkars would be back with friends, so I grabbed Zaalbar and we took off. Ever since then we've been a team. We look out for each other, you know?
Yeah, I suppose you're right. Like I used to tell my brother, fast talk and slick words don't get the job done.
What's that supposed to mean? You think I can't take care of myself? I've got street smarts! I know how to get by on my own!
In fact, I look out for Zaalbar more than he looks out for me, you know? Big Z's a little bit too gullible to make it alone on the mean streets of the Lower City.
He was fleeing some kind of trouble back on Kashyyyk. That's all I know, really. Big Z doesn't like to talk about it. In case you didn't notice he's the strong, silent type.
Doesn't much matter to me, though. I accept him for what he is, not what he was. Me and Zaalbar like to live in the present.
Mission!
Sorry Zaalbar, but I keep telling you to brush those choppers once in a while. Why do you think I won't stand downwind when you're talking?
Hey, I don't need a lecture from you. You ain't my mother! I knew what I was doing.
Hey, nobody said the Vulkars was smart. But there were three of them, so maybe they figured they could handle him. I don't know.
Sorry, I don't have one handy right now. Besides, we've got plenty of security spikes already. Not much point in overloading on them, is there?
No problem. Just so happens I've got one here I've been working on. Here you go... I'll just add it to our inventory.
Anything else you need?
Want to practice your skills, eh? Sure - I'll play you a few hands. Just for practice, though. I don't want to bet with you.
How am I supposed to know anything about this planet? It's an uncharted world in an unexplored quadrant! I didn't even know this planet was here!
Didn't you come here back when you were the Dark Lord? If you don't remember anything about this place then I guess we're just stumbling in the dark.
Manaan's the source for all the kolto in the galaxy; that's why those fish-faced Selkath can stay neutral in this whole Sith-Republic war. But I don't know much else about this place.
I always heard Tatooine was nothing but a rock covered by a bunch of worthless sand. I can't even figure out why Czerka Corp. set up their mining operations here.
I don't know anything about Korriban, but I get a bad feeling in this place. If there's such a thing as an 'evil' planet, this is it!
Well, I know Zaalbar's from Kashyyyk, but he never liked to talk about it. He wouldn't even tell me why he left. I don't think the Wookiees like outsiders much.
I'm not the one you should ask about Dantooine. I didn't even know there was a Jedi Academy here; I always thought it was just a bunch of settlers and farmers!
Sorry I can't be more help, you know? Is there anything else I can do for you?
Taris is a pretty good place to grow up, all things considered. Just stick to the area you belong in and stay out of Davik's business and you'll be fine.
Hey, no problem. I'm here to help, right?
I tend to keep my nose out of an intergalactic crime lord's business, you know? I can't tell you much that isn't common knowledge.
Extortion, slavery, smuggling: Davik's got a piece of all the action here on Taris. Even the swoop gangs know better than to get in his way.
It can be pretty nasty down there: you've got rakghouls crawling around looking for their next meal, and the Gamorrean slavers like to set up their bases in the sewers.
And then there's the Outcast village - a collection of people banished to the Undercity for their crimes. I mostly avoid the village, though; it's pretty depressing seeing how they live.
What can I say? The Lower City was a great place to hang out until the Vulkars started that gang war. Now you can't even walk the streets without getting shot at!
The Upper City's got some nice shops and all, but it's boring! The only time I go up there is if I need free healing from Zelka at his medical facility.
Huh? Oh... sorry. I was thinking about Taris. I still can't believe it's gone! I mean, I grew up there and now it's... it's... it's just gone!
What? How can you be so cruel! Millions of people dead and you all you can say is 'get over it'?
Look, I'm not saying I can't go on or anything like that. It's just... it's a shock, you know? I mean, I knew the Sith were evil and all, but the reality of it kind of slaps you in the face.
But I suppose that's why we need to stop Malak, right? The more time I spend dwelling on Taris the more chance some other planet will get wiped out. I guess that's what it comes down to.
So don't worry about me; I'll be okay. And if you need my help against Malak or the Sith, I'll be there for you!
I don't really think there's anything you can say. I just have to find some way to deal with it, I guess. It'll take some time.
Yeah... I know. The Jedi got rid of Revan, so I figure Malak's days are numbered, too. But that doesn't make the pain go away, you know?
Nothing. Never mind.
I want to talk to you about your brother.
If I ever see your brother again he's a dead man!
I still hate that core-slime's guts!
That's a very mature attitude, Mission.
So you're okay?
I invested a lot in Griff. I'm still looking to get some payback!
Griff's a slime ball, Mission. Accept it.
Don't give up on him, Mission. He could still change.
You said it, Mission! Let the Exchange take care of that slime!
What do you care? He left you to die on Tais!
Whatever happens, he brought it on himself.
No one can teach him this lesson, Mission. He has to learn it himself.
You have to stick by your family, Mission. Even if they're slime sometimes.
You can't turn your back on your own brother!
I've got more important things to worry about, Mission.
He's probably already dead, Mission.
Don't worry Mission - we'll get him back.
Griff may not be perfect, but he is your brother, Mission.
You mean you believe her story now?
Kind of like how you came to Taris in the first place.
So he sacrificed you to save his own hide?
I think he deserves a swift kick in the groin for what he did.
When the time comes you'll know what to say, Mission.
I don't think we'll have time, Mission.
We'll find your brother, Mission.
What did she do to you?
Why do you hate her so much?
Did Lena dump him?
You mean no matter how much he stole.
So what happened?
Maybe she actually liked Griff.
Sounds like you're jealous.
We should get back to the job at hand.
Sounds like he deserted you.
Maybe something happened to him.
How is this Lena's fault?
I don't have time for this.
You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to.
Embarassing? Why?
I really don't care about your traumatic childhood.
How could your brother do that to a five year old?
You were stowaways?
What kind of problems did your brother have?
Pretty handy skills to have, Mission.
Sounds like he was nothing but a petty criminal.
Griff doesn't sound like he's big on keeping promises.
Why did he leave?
Let's get back to our mission, Mission.
What are you talking about? What happened?
Who's Lena?
He's family. You have to stick by your family.
I want to know a little more about you, Mission.
Where are your parents? Don't you have a family?
Could your story be more boring? I've heard enough.
I hope I don't have to listen to you prattle on about your brother now!
I didn't know you had a brother.
Go on.
That'll teach you to stick your nose where it doesn't belong!
Smacking a kid? Those Vulkars have no class!
Did Zaalbar kill him?
What did the other two Vulkars do?
We should get back to the task at hand.
How did you survive before you met Zaalbar?
How did Zaalbar end up on Taris?
You're lucky he didn't fry you with a blaster.
Who'd want to pick a fight with a Wookiee?
How did you and Zaalbar hook up?
I need you to make me a security spike.
Do you feel like playing some Pazaak?
Do you know anything about the planet we're on?
Thanks for the info.
Tell me about Davik.
Tell me about the Undercity.
Tell me about the Lower City.
Tell me about the Upper City.
Taris is a wasteland - get over it!
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Malak will pay for what he did, Mission.
Beep-beep-beep.
Beep-beep beep woop!
Beep-beep beeple beep-beep! Woop!
Beep frotz. (Negatory)
Beep-beep beep.
Can you construct a programming spike for me, T3?
You can't make another one just yet? Got it.
There she is! Get her, men, but remember: don't kill her!
Ack! *cough* Heh, you seem to have defeated me, Cathar worm, but I'll have the last laugh in the end!
What do you mean?
He may not, but I will make him pay with what little time he has left! I will make him tell me what he has done to my people!
*cough* You may have killed me here, today, but I had the pleasure of killing off your species!
Not everyone who fought alongside the Mandalorians did it for their stupid concept of 'honor'. Some of us did it just for the pleasure: the pleasure of seeing your world burn.
You... you animal! You wretch!
*cough* *cough* Heh, but I'm beyond your petty vengeance now, girl. You can never have your revenge!
No! I cannot give in to my anger. I will not give him the satisfaction of making me that way.
Worm!
I killed your people on Cathar in the sky, on the ground, in their homes. I hunted them down like the animals they were, just to see them burn.
But the treacherous beasts fought back and left me with injuries that meant I could never fight again... or so they thought!
Hahah- *cough* *cough* But you won't! You're the cowardly type, all of you. You don't have the guts to finish me now!
No, I will not give in to him.
I ended up in the Lower City of Taris, and what did I find? A few of those stinking beasts living there!
The male was easy enough to best, but the females proved elusive. I didn't know what happened to them after I killed the male, until I saw this cursed woman on the auction block.
But then the Jedi came and ruined everything before I could have my revenge... *cough*
You... You killed my father, you killed my people, you treat us like animals... You deserve to die!
Give in and embrace your hate! You're no better than me! You're nothing!
I... I...
You... You will die for what you have done!
I... Help me, please! Do not let me give in to my anger again!
... There is peace.
No, I will not do this. He may die, but it will not be out of my vengeance.
You coward! You weak... ahhh... gurk! *death rattle*
Haha! Your kind always were weak-minded!
I will not give him the satisfaction of seeing me give in to the dark side.
*grunt* What the hell is your kind doing here? Bad enough I have to deal with all these other idiots, but now there's a stinkin' Cathar on this world too?
I have as much right to be here as you do, SIR!
Ooooo! Big woman, the Jedi, shooting her mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.
Ooooo! Big man, the Jedi, shooting his mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.
Hiding behind your pet Cathar... And a woman at that!
We should have exterminated all you Cathar when we had the chance.
Heh, yeah, do like the Jedi tells you and back off! Your people are pathetic, it's no wonder we crushed your world so easily.
Wha... What do you know about my world?
I know enough that... Hey, wait a minute... you look familiar somehow...
What? You...
This doesn't concern you, Jedi trash.
Hm... now where could I have... No, he's dead and she likely is too. I...
What are you talking about??
Maybe I was wrong. Still, I think a specimen like you would be a nice addition to my collection.
So what would it take, Jedi, for you to sell your pet here to me?
Heh, I knew we could work something out.
I am not for sale!
Now don't be so selfish. We both know Cathar aren't real people anyway.
The females make amusing pets, but males should be put down like the animals they are. I remember one time on Taris...
What?! WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
WHAT DID YOU DO ON TARIS, YOU SCUM?!
Put one of you down like the animals you are. So easy... then I saw one of the females on the auction block, but those darn Jedi...
It was you!
What? Me? Oh ho! Now I recognize where I've seen that face before.
You were the little Cathar I was going to purchase. But those Jedi came and stole my pet away from me!
When I was fighting with the Mandalorians against the Cathar, I developed an appreciation for these creatures. They make excellent servants if properly trained.
You Jedi act all prim and proper, but inside you must feel the same way I do about the lesser, non-human species. The Sith at least let their feelings show on the outside.
You... My homeworld...
Come now, will you let your pet go? I'm sure we can come up with a price we both think is fair.
NO, I WILL NOT BE SOLD!
And I will see you dead for what you have done to my people!
Uh... hold on a second! Don't be hasty!
Yes, we.... NO! I must not fall prey to the dark side again.
...There is peace.
I... I will remain calm. I am a Jedi now.
My lust for vegeance must be curbed.
Yes, yes... Say no to the dark side...
But I will have you yet! Heh.
Don't listen to him.
He doesn't have long, Juhani.
Yes, what do you mean?
You could kill him now.
We should just kill you now.
This isn't going to work.
Stop trying to provoke her!
Quit your whining!
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Do not give in Juhani. You are stronger than this.
Kill him now.
Do not do it, Juhani.
There is no emotion...
Just step away.
Just ignore him.
Do not give in to the dark side, Juhani.
A big mouth like that can get you killed.
Just ignore him, Juhani.
You annoy me, worm.
Well... what are you offering?
She is her own person.
She is not for sale!
Calm down, Juhani.
You were on Taris?
What are you saying?
What are you talking about?
You were buying Cathar slaves?
You bought Juhani?
Show me the money first.
Let's get him!
There is no emotion...
Do not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.
You'll only hurt her if I let her go.
She is not for sale!
We should just leave, Juhani.
Do you two know each other?
Do not seek to aggravate us.
I know nothing of what you speak.
I cannot help you with that.
Is there something you want?
Very well.
I am sorry, but I don't feel like talking. All I have seen tells me that my home is just as I left it. We are still enslaved.
For now, just let me think of what must be done. When I learn something new I will comment.
I will fulfill my life debt with you, but I don't think outsiders are worthy of knowing about me or my people.
I don't think I have to explain why. You witnessed what happened on Kashyyyk, what is still going on.
I am only a slave to you, just like my people are slaves. Well, Chuundar has shown me how to use you anyway.
Did we ask to be enslaved? Suffer like we have and then you can criticize how we dealt with this.
Chuundar has done what he must to ensure we survive. I see it now. He has shown me you can be used.
Chuundar showed me that you are all the same, all greedy, but I also learned that outsiders can be used.
As long as you think you are leading, you don't care what those beneath you do. I will use this to my advantage.
I owe you a life debt, and I will honor it, but I will also serve myself. That is all I have to say.
You have seen more than I would have allowed, and taught me some things too. I am grateful for that.
It will be a while before I know what my role will be in making Kashyyyk truly free. I have a lot to learn.
I will follow.
I should get mad, but I won't. Your comment was callous, but you have shown you respect my people.
And it is that harshness of you outsiders that I must try to understand. I will follow undistracted while I observe.
You and I have important things to do, and I don't feel bad about leaving this time. I know I'll be welcomed back.
I'm not sure I really know. Father expects much of me... I guess I do as well.
I think, when I've learned enough, I'll bring it back to Kashyyyk. What happens then... we'll see.
I have said all I am going to. I will follow you as my life debt commands, but you are just another outsider to me.
I will honor my life debt, but I don't feel we share more than that. Mission may say more, but I will not.
Thank you.
A life debt is the greatest respect. I just don't think you could understand anything about me.
It is nothing personal, but I just don't feel you could understand anything about me.
The ways of my people are not for outsiders to know. You'll have to be content with that.
That may be, but not today.
All right, let's see what I can do. I think I have enough parts for something. Just a moment.
There you are. One grenade. Careful with it.
You've got a bunch already. You really don't want these things banging around together. Use some up first.
Unless you want someone threatened or a door bashed in, you should ask someone else.
I don't know much about the planets we visit, but... I suppose I should learn.
When you ask someone else, I will listen as well.
I know that it isn't my homeworld. That is all I care about. There is nothing here to interest me.
So many things have changed on Kashyyyk. I'm not sure what my place is. I must learn more about you outsiders.
Chuundar has told me much about our failures here. I think learning how to really live elsewhere will help.
And maybe... maybe I'll come back to fight... but not now.
When I know enough, I will understand how to best serve my people. I will travel with eyes open this time.
But, I leave with good feelings. My father will do what is right until I can return. And I will, when my life-debt is paid.
I have been away from Kashyyyk a long time, but things look the same as I left them. Slavers still hold my people prisoner.
I'm not sure what I could tell you. Or even what I would want to. You are an outsider here too. It angers me.
Nothing. Never mind.
Have anything more to say about yourself, Zaalbar?
Your attitude better not interfere with your service to me.
Perhaps the outsiders are to blame, but your people are complicit.
The slavers are responsible for what happened, not me.
I wish you well. Let's get going.
This nostalgia won't interfere with your service to me, I hope.
Never mind. Let's just get moving.
I'm sorry we can't stay on Kashyyyk longer.
Why did you request to take Bacca's Sword?
I want to know a little more about you, Zaalbar.
Then I will leave you be.
I saved you. I deserve respect.
You don't trust me?
You'll have to tell me more eventually.
I want you to make me a grenade.
I wonder if you could help me with a problem.
Do you know anything about the planet we're on?
Maybe we'll talk later.
I heard the Sith are sending salvage teams down into the Undercity to recover those Republic escape pods.
I heard the gangs have overrun the Lower City. Why don't the Sith go down there and restore order?
I've got a ton of things to do today. I can't talk to you.
Don't - don't hurt my family! Just take what you want and get out.
Please, don't take me in for questioning... I don't know anything! I swear!
I heard a bunch of wreckage from the battle overhead crashed into the Undercity. Think of the damage it could have caused if it had landed here!
What's this, another off-worlder? I didn't realize how many of you there were on Taris until this Sith quarantine.
If the Sith wanted to get on everyone's good side, they'd go clean up the swoop gangs in the Lower City.
People complain about the Sith, but this quarantine is good for all the businesses on Taris. Look at Javyar's cantina. That place has never been busier!
I'm not looking for any trouble with you Sith. Please, just leave me alone.
I wonder if any of those Republic space pods survived crash landing in the Undercity?
Stay out of the Lower City. That place is overrun with gangs!
Taris used to be a nice place, before the Sith showed up and started bossing us around!
I remember when a person didn't have to worry about thieves rummaging through their home!
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't want to get in the way of official Sith business.
I heard the Sith are sending salvage teams into the Undercity. I heard they're looking for Republic survivors to take prisoner.
Ever since the Sith quarantine Javyar's cantina is packed with off-worlders! It never used to be that busy.
I heard there's a swoop gang war in the Lower City! They say you can get shot just walking in the streets down there!
I can't believe the Sith put a quarantine on the planet! It's bad enough we can't leave, but all you off-worlders are stuck here, too!
I'm not doing anything wrong! I'm just standing here... you Sith can't arrest me for that!

The common Badger is a small but fierce mammal. Its strong forelimbs are armed with long claws, used for both digging and self-defense.
Badger
Combat Suit
Even the most frugal of mercenaries know they need at least some protection from the rigors of combat, although suits of this type are recommended for light skirmishes only.
Zabrak Combat Suit
A Zabrak improvement on the combat suit, this armor is good protection where speed and unrestricted movement are more important than bulky plating.
Echani Light Armor
Echani prefer elegant design to brute force. The Maktites learned this when their stores of thermal weapons were rendered ineffective by simple changes in the Echani light armor.
Cinnagar Weave Armor
A complex organic weave protects this armored suit from extremes in temperature. Armor similar to it proved decisive in defending Cinnagar from the Sith under Naga Sadow.
Massassi Ceremonial Armor
Long-term domination by the Sith has erased the memory of the Massassi rituals for which this armor was designed, but it retains its effectiveness on the battlefield regardless.
Darth Bandon's Fiber Armor
Special:
Upgradeable, Armor
Despite the unfortunate fate of Darth Bandon, this light armor remains a desirable asset for any warrior. The silvery polish reflects a pride in craftsmanship rarely seen today.

Heavy Combat Suit
This version of the combat suit offers more protection than the basic model. It is heavier overall and not quite as flexible, but many consider the tradeoffs worthwhile.
Bonadan Alloy Heavy Suit
Bonadan is an emerging industrial society financing their exploration of the galaxy through production of small arms and armor. They favor heavy materials offering solid defense.
Zabrak Battle Armor
In northern Iridonia the Zabrak produce expensive armor that nonetheless has become very popular on the galactic markets, due to excellent low-temperature defensive properties.
Zabrak Field Armor
This is a higher-quality version of the basic armor produced by the Zabrak. These were often reserved for field commanders, and meant to be easily identified on the battlefield.
Reinforced Fiber Armor
Inspired by craftsmen on worlds where metal is in short supply, this type of light armor consists of jung-ju tree fibers bound with synthetics, offering good, flexible protection.
Ulic Qel Droma's Mesh Suit
After killing his brother during the Exar Kun war, Ulic Qel Droma abandoned this armor and all the trappings of his service to the dark side. It's a powerful, if tainted, item.
Eriadu Prototype Armor
Special:
Upgradeable, Armor
This armor combines good protection and easy movement to create an impression of competence about the owner, but Eriadu has delayed general production pending further tests.

Special:
Upgradeable, Armor
This armor combines good protection and easy movement to allow even a novice to fight like a seasoned veteran, but Eriadu has delayed general production pending further tests.
Military Suit
This standard issue suit provides good protection, but can be heavier and more restrictive than some of its counterparts. Even so, many mercenaries swear the tradeoffs are worth it.
Echani Battle Armor
This armor provides solid defense at the cost of some flexibility, although it is still an Echani product and is therefore well suited to quick-moving combat.
Cinnagar War Suit
After the Great Hyperspace War a thousand years ago, the heirs of Empress Teta militarized their world and industry, a legacy that produced battle armor still sought after today.
Verpine Fiber Mesh
Raxsus Nuli had plans of planetary conquest in the wake of Sith aggression. Though eclipsed by recent events, the Jedi saw the pirate jailed and his Verpine stockpiles auctioned.
Arkanian Bond Armor
Ancient Arkanians pioneered many unique alloys that lose heat at a very slow rate, producing armor that is very resistant to sudden changes in temperature.
Exar Kun's Light Battle Suit
Attributed to Exar Kun, this armor may well have been worn by the Dark Lord prior to his defeat forty years ago. He was rarely without considerable, yet flexible, personal armor.
Davik's War Suit
Davik spent lavishly on his safety, and many a bounty hunter ended up dead in the streets for underestimating both his will to live and the protective qualities of his armor.
Special:
Upgradeable, Armor
Davik spent lavishly on his safety, and many a bounty hunter ended up dead in the streets for underestimating both his will to live and the protective qualities of his armor.

Light Battle Armor
Providing solid protection for a minimal cost, this armor is excellent for entrenched troops or guards. A force on the move, however, may find it somewhat constricting.
Bronzium Light Battle Armor
This molded armor is made of better materials than standard military issue, but is still relatively cheap and easy to mass-produce, making it ideal for light militias and the like.
Powered Light Battle Armor
This is an early attempt at power-assisted armor. Dampening fields block the noise of servomotors, unintentionally shielding against external extremes in sonic frequencies as well.
Krath Heavy Armor
Typical of the old Krath military elite, these suits were worn during slave raids on neighboring systems. Slaving is profitable but risky, so little cost is spared in equipment.
Krath Holy Battle Suit
Many Krath sought to be guards of their dark temples in armor of this type. Cynics dismiss this fervor, noting that guard duty was safer than participating in military slave raids.
Jamoh Hogra's Battle Armor
Jamoh Hogra was a Zabrak mercenary who feared for his life after a raid on a Sith dreadnaught. He spent a fortune on his personal armor, only to be killed while in the bath.
Battle Armor
This isn't the heaviest of armor, but it comes close. Designed for heavy militias, it has the protection needed to keep a soldier alive during ranged combat with massive weapons.
Powered Battle Armor
The micro-hydraulics of this armor provides the operator with both protection and strength enhancement. It is rare outside of professional mercenaries and soldiers.
Cinnagar Plate Armor
While much time was spent on the appearance, this armor is still meant for the personal guards of dignitaries, and is therefore highly effective against many forms of attack.
Mandalorian Armor
Mandalorians are among the most feared combatants in the galaxy, and the quality of their gear may be why. Even the lowliest warrior is a threat in such protective armor.
Calo Nord's Battle Armor
Special:
Upgradeable, Armor
Commissioned by Calo Nord, this armor was based on heavily modified Mandalorian designs. The maker was killed to appease Nord's ego, ensuring his suit would forever be unique.

Verpine Zal Alloy Mesh
Using the highly expensive Zal alloy, the Verpine have developed a suit without peer. The only thing greater than the protective capabilities of this armor is the price.
Heavy Battle Armor
This is the heaviest armor available for the soldier that requires maximum protection from direct damage. Some consider the fit claustrophobic, but that's the tradeoff for safety.
Durasteel Heavy Armor
Battle armor production is thriving on Bonadan as the Republic recovers from war. This model's thinner skin of durasteel reduces weight, but still restricts movement somewhat.
Mandalorian Battle Armor
Republic soldiers saw this armor all too often during the Mandalorian War. It's understandable that the conflict could drag on when a fanatical enemy is so defensively outfitted.
Mandalorian Heavy Armor
This armor is reserved for respected veteran Mandalorians. Immensely sturdy, stabilizers diffuse energy throughout the frame, shielding the wearer from disorienting impacts.
Jurgan Kalta's Power Suit
Special:
Upgradeable, Armor
Aided by custom armor like this, Jurgan Kalta had no combat equal, so his enemies tried more exotic attacks. It was a gaxxan brain-slug left on a pillow that proved his undoing.

Droid Heavy Plating Type 1
Originally used on starship hulls, durasteel is the best protection available for droids. This particular variant of the alloy is the standard for mass-production heavy combat droids.
Droid Heavy Plating Type 2
A specialized variant of heavy plating, this type of durasteel alloy is not sold in mass quantities. More often, it is used to equip elite troops where the initial cost of the battle droid warrants the investment.
Droid Heavy Plating Type 3
The heaviest protection available, this type of plating is uncommon due to the cost involved in production. It is best suited to specialized assassin or assault droids, though such units are highly regulated.
Droid Light Plating Type 1
A thin sheet of alloy plating is a relatively inexpensive way to improve a droid's chance of surviving combat. This model is an excellent option for light-duty droids.
Droid Light Plating Type 2
Though more for the factory floor, plating of this type is seeing more general use. Light but effective, this upgrade can mean the difference between repair and replacement if a droid comes to harm.
Droid Light Plating Type 3
The strongest of the light-grade plating, this is the best protection most individuals consider purchasing for droids not actively in a class intended for combat.
Droid Medium Plating Type 1
Developed by engineer Hoot Calin, this plating relies more on deflecting angles than exotic alloys. Cost can be prohibitive, though this is the most affordable model of the type.
Droid Medium Plating Type 2
This version of the Calin Industries plating system signaled a company shift in production from construction droids to military models. It now sees use on many different worlds.
Droid Medium Plating Type 3
To solidify its place in the market, Calin Industries introduced this specialty variant of their medium plating system. Only heavy plating protects better, though the cost is prohibitive for some.
Droid Motion Sensors Type 1
These devices allow a droid to better detect creatures hidden by stealth fields. This basic model is the most inexpensive of the type, and is commonly available on many worlds.
Droid Motion Sensors Type 2
This sensor package greatly enhances droid vision, increasing the likelihood of detecting creatures hidden by stealth fields. This model is marketed mainly to manufacturers of sentry and combat droids.
Droid Motion Sensors Type 3
Incorporating the most sophisticated sensors available, this model of upgrade is usually purchased for special-duty droids guarding sensitive materials or galactic heads of state.
Repair Kit

An unconscious opponent is a quiet opponent. This weapon is a Bothan favorite, designed to "create opportunities."
Sith Assassin Pistol
These weapons are designed to incapacitate so death may be quick or lingered upon as desired. Droids are simply dispatched, as cruelty is best rationed among the living.
Bothan Needler
For serious espionage, this is the weapon of choice. Simple ownership can get you arrested in some systems, or invited to dine with royalty, depending on what it helped you learn.
Heavy Repeating Blaster
This weapon again increases the firepower available to the foot soldier or mercenary, but it is not for the lightly armored that wish to be quick on their feet.
Mandalorian Heavy Repeater
With this weapon, the Mandalorians again demonstrate a complete lack of subtlety. The only thing better than a big blaster apparently, is one that shoots faster.
Cassus Fett's Heavy Pistol
Heavy Blaster
These resemble regular blasters in the same way Quoorian marshsuckers resemble mosquitoes. Sure, they both do damage, but the former definitely has the edge in kill-potential.
Arkanian Heavy Pistol
Arkanian designs of this kind predated mass acceptance of heavier pistols, but 2000 years later they are still superior performers.
Zabrak Tystel Mark III
The Zabrak killed many pirates who were attempting to seize shipments of these weapons and then sold them on the black market anyway. It's not a matter of where they end up, but of who gets paid.
Mandalorian Heavy Pistol
Mandalorians boast that a shot from one of these pistols can take a starship out of commission. It's an obvious exaggeration, but for safety's sake, most listeners just smile and nod.
Special:
Upgradeable, Ranged
Cassus Fett was rarely seen without this adaptable blaster. Famous for killing the captain of a flagship Republic frigate at the Battle of Jaga's Cluster, he is presumed dead.

Ion Blaster
Unlike a typical blaster, this weapon fires a stream of energy very damaging to electrical systems, causing havoc on the internal components of droids.
Verpine Prototype Ion Blaster
Demonstrating this weapon, the insect-like Verpine destroyed legions of droids, doing nothing to quell the public's suspicions of what testing their stun guns must have been like.
Ion Grenade
Damage: Ion, 48pts
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC15 for half damage
These grenades emit an extremely strong burst of energy devastating to any droids or personal shields unfortunate enough to be caught in the effect.
Ion Rifle
Any well-stocked militia usually has stores of ion rifles in reserve. They aren't much use against the living, but if the enemy has battle droids these weapons become essential.
Bothan Droid Disruptor
Droids can be difficult obstacles for a spy, but these weapons take all the guesswork out of dealing with them.
Verpine Droid Disruptor
While they may have borrowed liberally from designs the Bothans initiated, the Verpine say you can't argue with results. These weapons are simply devastating against droids.
Lightsaber
Traditionally associated with the Jedi, the lightsaber is a devastating weapon difficult to master. Properties can vary with the type of focusing crystal used in construction.
Long Sword
Here is where the roots of the lightsaber begin, with traditional swords still wielded today in many primitive cultures. They are simple, but still effective in the right hands.
Krath War Blade
Twisted by the dark side, the Krath tempered swords with the power of the Force perhaps even before lightsabers became the weapon of the Jedi, both dark and light.
Naga Sadow's Poison Blade
The mere presence of Dark Lord Naga Sadow would come to imbue his personal weapons with the taint he carried, poisoned as his spirit was.
Blaster Pistol: Null
Heavy Blaster: Null
Ion Rifle: Null
Light Repeating Blaster: Null
Blaster Rifle: Null
Blaster Carbine: Null
Poison Grenade
Damage: None
Secondary:
Poison, 5pts every 6sec
Duration: 36sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC25 for no effect
This grenade unleashes a blast of poison gas that affects the nervous system, lingering in the air to ensure that the effect is not escaped easily.
Quarterstaff
Usually just a smooth staff of wood or light alloys, this is a very simple weapon of ancient design.
Massassi Battle Staff
The Massassi were a proud race altered by the Sith millennia ago, and subsequently exterminated along with Exar Kun. This weapon was the symbol of a proven warrior.
Raito's Gaderffii
This may have belonged to a Sand People warrior famous among his kind for killing a young Jedi, but the one tribe that kept the oral history of this event was wiped out long ago.
Light Repeating Blaster
This weapon allows the user to fire more quickly than usual, increasing his chances of survival without drastically changing the amount of equipment he would normally carry.
Blaster Cannon
The blaster cannon is a favorite among those that have become wealthy enough to hire experienced, dangerous crew and might need a way to take them out quick if things go bad.
Crystal, Rubat
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
Used in lightsaber construction, rubat crystal is mined on Phemis. It produces a clearly defined blade that a Jedi can easily focus on.
Crystal, Damind
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
Found on the desert world of Daminia, this crystal can be used in lightsaber construction to produce a clearly defined beam of subtly wider width and length.
Crystal, Eralam
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
Once mined on the third moon of Erai, ancient Sith bombardment shattered much that remained. If they can be found, these crystals produce a clear, superior lightsaber beam.
Crystal, Sapith
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
This crystallized material was excreted once every 11 years by the ancient Volice worm of Lwhekk, now extinct. It produces a more intense lightsaber beam, granting better control.
Crystal, Nextor
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
This crystal is mined in the mountains of planet M'haeli, and when used in lightsaber construction it produces a volatile blade that can cause surprising amounts of damage.
Crystal, Opila
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
Found in the asteroid fields of the Fyrth system, this crystal can be used in lightsaber construction to produce an intense beam that seems extraordinarily quick to the cut.
Crystal, Jenruax
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
The refined form of Opila, this crystal has been cleansed of all impurities. When used in lightsaber construction it produces a blade of unerring quickness.
Crystal, Phond
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
The strange byproduct of rare impurities bonding during the making of certain alloys and some random external condition, this crystal produces a fiercely burning lightsaber beam.
Crystal, Luxum
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
Ambria was a world in the grip of the dark side. Through years of mental battle, strange Jedi Master Thon contained the evil to Lake Natth. Long meditation can form this powerful crystal from the tainted water.
Crystal, Firkrann
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
This heavy crystal is collected by the natives of Rafa V. If used in lightsaber construction it produces an electrically charged beam that is much easier to manipulate than standard beams.
Crystal, Bondar
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
This crystal was mined on a far-orbit asteroid circling the Alderaan system. It produces a volatile lightsaber beam that pulses on impact, discharging part of its energy into an opponent.
Crystal, Sigil
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
Mined in the Sigil System, this crystal is a costly but valued addition to a lightsaber. It produces a fiercely bright beam that sears on contact, inflicting great damage.
Crystal, Upari
Special:
Upgrade Item, Lightsaber
Strangely, this crystal is usually encountered scattered in the orbit of primarily forest worlds. It is brittle but versatile, and a Master Jedi can get it to produce many effects.
Short Lightsaber
Lightsabers can come in shorter styles, often used in the off hand during two-weapon fighting. As in larger versions, different focusing crystals can produce additional effects.
Short Sword
Disregarded by most modern warriors, a good short sword can still serve well in combat if the user is skilled.
Massassi Brand
During the reign of Naga Sadow the Massassi were transformed into foot soldiers for the Sith. This was their traditional weapon, altered, as they were, to serve the dark side.
Teta's Blade
Attributed to Empress Teta, these knives speak of her background as a warrior, and of her willingness to be on the frontline of the Great Hyperspace War a thousand years ago.
Sonic Grenade
Damage: Sonic, 36pts
Secondary: Stun for 9sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC15 for half damage, negates stun
These grenades explode loudly, but the majority of their effect is delivered in extreme frequencies the ear can barely perceive, even as it is damaged.
Sonic Pistol
Sometimes referred to as "squealers," these weapons deliver a high-frequency jolt to the senses that can damage and potentially disorient an opponent.
Bothan Shrieker
This is an improvement over the standard sonic pistol design that must seem doubly shrill to the large ears of the Bothans.
Sonic Rifle
More powerful than the pistol, the sonic rifle fires a blast of sound that causes a great deal of sensory overload in addition to damage, disorienting the victim.
Bothan Discord Gun
This was conceived as a "last resort" weapon should espionage fail and a quick retreat be called for. It is effective, but the Bothans would prefer that it not be needed.
Arkanian Sonic Rifle
The Arkanians pioneered many non-lethal weapons that could disorient opponents, but most were retrofitted to be superior damage dealers as well because the initial demand for them was so low.
Stun Baton
A common weapon, stun batons do minimal damage but can incapacitate a target. The high-density cells needed for repeated discharge are unwieldy, making it unusable in the off-hand.
Bothan Stun Stick
A useful tool for espionage, this weapon is more effective than the standard stun baton, but is still available on most worlds. High-density discharge cells make this item unwieldy and unusable in the off-hand.
Bothan Chuka
A very effective device used by Bothan elite. Some systems consider simple possession of one as grounds for execution as a spy. High-density discharge cells make this item unwieldy and unusable in the off-hand.
Rakatan Battle Wand
Special:
Upgradeable, Melee
Weighted to fit a Rakatan grip, this item is most like a stun baton. It seems more adaptable than one of Republic issue, though similar high-density cells make it unwieldy and unusable in the off-hand.

Concussion Grenade
Damage: None
Secondary: Stun for 9sec
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC20 for no effect
This type of grenade explodes in a concussive wave of force that can render anyone in the area of effect temporarily senseless.
Thermal Detonator
Damage: Energy, 60pts
Secondary: Knockdown
Area of Effect: 4m
Range: Medium
Save:
DC15 for half damage
This Republic device contains a baradium explosive that produces a small fusion energy explosion of great force. Civilian possession of these items is outlawed almost everywhere.
Vibro Double-Blade
Ultrasonic vibrations make this double-bladed sword exceptionally deadly, and a rare Echani cortosis weave protects it against lightsaber sparring damage, ensuring effectiveness even against Jedi and Sith.
Sith War Sword
Though most favor lightsabers, some Sith prefer the more visceral feel of metal cutting flesh. These blades are usually impregnated with rare cortosis to protect against lightsaber sparring damage.
Echani Double-Brand
Excess energy from the generator in this vibrosword is conducted through the blades directly. Also possessing a rare lightsaber-deflecting cortosis weave, this weapon is a deadly Echani masterpiece.
Yusanis' Brand
Special:
Upgradeable, Melee
Yusanis was the most famous of Echani warriors, fighting against oppression and villainy until encountering Darth Revan. Discovering that Revan had killed an Echani senator, Yusanis attempted to tell authorities but fell to the powers of the Sith Lord, despite his own impressive abilities and the cortosis weave inherent in all Echani vibroblades.

Vibroblade
Small size makes this a good off hand weapon. Echani vibroblades use a rare cortosis weave to prevent lightsaber sparring damage, allowing traditional swordplay to continue in the time of Jedi and Sith.
Krath Blood Blade
Twisted by the dark side, this Krath weapon is as deadly as a modern vibroblade. It was meant for assassination, and a cortosis weave that prevents lightsaber sparring damage ensured that even Jedi must respect it.
Echani Vibroblade
These blades are typically used in the off hand. In addition to a cortosis weave that deflects lightsaber sparring damage, some Echani vibroblades are supercooled to keep them in alignment, giving them an icy sting.
Sanasiki's Blade
Special:
Upgradeable, Melee
Sanasiki used this weapon to kill Nelinik, a Zabrak who assassinated the Echani High Protector with battle droids. Cortosis protects the blade against lightsaber sparring damage while energy cells disrupt droid opponents.

Vibrosword
Ultrasonic generators power this Echani-developed weapon design. A rare cortosis weave that protects against sparring damage ensures that traditional swordplay will endure in the time of lightsabers.
Krath Dire Sword
This was a weapon of distinction in the time of the Krath. Protected against lightsaber sparring damage, Sith would grant these cortosis-laced blades to only the most loyal underlings.
Sith Tremor Sword
Traced to the Bladeborn, a Sith offshoot dedicated to sword mastery, these cortosis-laced weapons were given to "masterblades" who survived no less than ten lightsaber-wielding warriors in combat.
Echani Foil
These swords were crafted to honor Raskta Fenni, the best Echani duelist of her time. Many were sold, but imperfections in the difficult lightsaber-deflecting cortosis weave caused few to survive.

You summoned me, Lord Malak?
The search for Bastila is taking too long. We cannot risk her escaping Taris. Destroy the entire planet.
Th... the entire planet, Lord Malak? But... there are billions of people on Taris! We'd be slaughtering countless innocent civilians. Not to mention our own men still on the surface.
Your predecessor once made the mistake of questioning my orders, Admiral. Surely you are not so foolish as to make the same mistake?
No of course not. I... I will do as you command. But it will take several hours to position our fleet.
Then I suggest you begin immediately. You are dismissed, Captain.
Yes, Lord Malak.

Admiral Karath
DarthMalak
Jedi Enclave
The Council must be told about what we have discovered! Meet me in the Council chambers.
The Council has finished its deliberations and are waiting. We should see them now.
The vision again! Did you see it? You must have. Revan and Malak were here before us - I feel their dark presence. They must have come and found... this.
It's a map of hyperspace coordinates. Some sort of star chart. But what is this Sith Star Forge they mentioned? And why did they lust to uncover its secrets?
Maybe... that might explain how the Sith were able to amass a fleet so quickly...
Whatever this Star Forge is, it was important enough for Revan and Malak to betray the Jedi. This Star Forge must be the seat of their power. If it could be destroyed...
Such thoughts speak of the dark side! We serve the Republic and the Jedi Council. It must be their decision as to what course of action to take.
The hyperspace coordinates on this map might lead us to the Star Forge, if they were complete. But there are pieces missing.
I recognize one of the planets on the map: Korriban - a Sith world. And if that's Korriban, then this must be Kashyyyk... and Tatooine... and here's Manaan...
Now I think I understand. This map was only the starting point for Revan's dark journey into the ways of the Sith.
Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan, Korriban: Revan visited each of these worlds searching for clues to reveal the hidden location of the Star Forge.
Before we do anything we must inform the council of what we have discovered. They will decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.
I have spoken briefly with the Council; they request an audience with you. We should go at once.
An audience with the Jedi Council? That's pretty unusual for someone who isn't even a Jedi. What's this about, Bastila?
I'm sorry, Carth, but I cannot tell you. All I ask is that you trust in the Force and the wisdom of the Council.
Well, I don't like being left out of the loop, but I'm not looking to get you in any trouble with the Jedi Masters. We'll do things your way for a while.
Come, they are expecting us. I will lead you to the Council chambers.
We have done as the vision directed. When we pass through this door we will learn the secret uncovered by Malak and Revan.
Nothing seems to be happening. If we focus our minds together, we may be able to call on the Force and witness the vision of Malak and Revan once more.
As you wish - though a Jedi must not be afraid to turn to the Force when in need of guidance.
Open yourself to the power. Let the Force flow through you.
This is the entrance we saw in our dream. The Force has shown us how to open these doors through our visions.
This looks like a door... but I don't see any way to open it
Ahlan Matale has a reputation for being very temperamental. You must be the model of diplomacy when you speak to him.
Look at all these crystals - so beautiful, and so powerful. Each crystal gives off a different energy stream, so choose wisely when selecting the one for your lightsaber.
Dantooine looks peaceful enough, but packs of kath hounds roam these plains. We would be wise to keep our guard up while we are out here.
It looks like some sort of map...
What does it mean?
What is it?
Who said it had anything to do with the Sith? They may have allies in the background helping them now.
Could it have been a factory, or weapons plant?
Destroyed? If it could be harnessed...
How can we destroy it if we don't even know what it is?
So we're back at square one?
Can't you tell anything from the map?
We have to explore these worlds!
So now what?
What good is an incomplete map?
No, I do not need to see the vision again.
Yes, I want to see the vision again.
They're waiting for you inside.
This morning's getting stranger by the minute. First Bastila comes out looking like she saw a ghost, and now you.
Well, Bastila did mention that you should go to the Council chambers before she left. It is no doubt urgent, so you shouldn't keep them waiting.
You got it.
Well, I can't say I blame you. I... I haven't exactly been sleeping well myself. Here I thought things would get better once we escaped Taris.
No, she didn't. She didn't seem well, as I recall... and for that matter neither do you. Are you alright?
Patrol droids - they may be programmed to attack on sight!
Dantooine looks peaceful enough, but packs of kath hounds roam these plains. We need to keep our guard up while we're out here.
Let's go.
I had a rough night...
Did she say anything else?
I'm fine, Let's go.
I had a rough night... Let's go.
Why are you bothering me? I am here to speak with the Council, not some servant! Please leave or I shall be forced to tell the Council of your rude behavior!
I demand justice! The Sandral family is a blight upon Dantooine! They must be punished!
The Council will look into this matter, Mr. Matale. You must be patient. Your accusations have no proof, and we do not want you stirring up trouble with the Sandrals if there is some mistake.
Mistake? My son Shen is missing! How can there be any doubt the Sandrals are to blame?
There are other possible explanations for your son's disappearance.
Bah! You Jedi are good for nothing but talk! I shall only wait so long before I take action on my own!
As dangerous as the threat from Darth Malak and the Sith may be, we Jedi cannot simply abandon our other responsibilities. The Council has promised Alhan Matale we will look into his son's disappearance.
Should you have time, Padawan, you may want to investigate this matter.
These two families have been settled here for some years now...
And causing me no end of trouble!
Indeed. They have been settled here for some time and feuding ever since.
Both families have settled to the south of this enclave. The Matales are the closer of the two.
Both have similar estates, but Ahlan is much more paranoid about his and guards it quite heavily.
Is there anything else you wish to know?
The Sandral and Matale families are involved.
The Sandrals live far to the south. The head of that family is Nurik Sandral. He is a stern man, but I believe him fair. Under the present circumstances, though... who knows?
Ahlan Matale can be much more unstable. He is convinced of his own importance and can be a most... oppressive individual at times. He lives closer to the enclave, but still to the south.
Is there anything else you wished to know?
I do not know how the original feud started, but they want nothing to do with each other.
As you may have heard, Ahlan Matale believes that his son, Shen, has been kidnapped by Nurik Sandral.
Curiously, Nurik's son Casus has been missing for some time as well... I fear Nurik may suspect Ahlan in this...
Is there anything else you wish to know?
Your study and training are important, of course. But the Jedi are not a cloistered Order. Our influence and teachings must spread beyond the walls of our Academies.
It is in the real world that we truly prove ourselves worthy of the title Jedi. You would do well to remember this, young Padawan.
This task has its own importance. It may also serve to divert our minds for a short time... something which carries its own rewards.
Not to mention that I wouldn't mind getting out of this enclave for a bit. I mean, come on, how bad could it be?
If Shen Matale is not returned to his father it may ignite a savage and bloody feud between the Matale and Sandral estates. We must not allow that to happen.
Is there anything else I should know?
I must continue on my main mission.
I will investigate if there is time.
I shall investigate this immediately.
Where are they settled?
Which families are involved?
What caused this feud?
I have more important things to do!
But what about my Jedi training?
I shall look into it at once.
If you have questions, you should direct them towards the Jedi Council members.
Greetings, young Padawan. I trust your training goes well.
Master Zhar tells me you have successfully completed the tests, and I even see you have constructed your own lightsaber.
You should be proud of your accomplishment... but never forget that you still have much to learn.
As your power grows you will constantly face temptations to slip to the dark side. This is the eternal struggle of the Jedi.
Shen and Rahasia have been welcomed here in the compound for as long as they wish to stay. I am glad that your help enabled them to remain together.
A battle took place earlier to the south of the Enclave. A lot of people died and many droids were destroyed.
I wonder what dark force could have caused this to happen...
Greetings, apprentice... though I understand you shall not have that lowly title much longer. Master Zhar tells me your progress has been remarkable.
Soon, he feels, you will attain the rank of Padawan. Then you will truly be a full-fledged Jedi. How are you enjoying your training?
There are caves on Dantooine that hold those rare crystals. But be warned, apprentice: They are dangerous. You should not meddle in things beyond you.
All Jedi must know the code. Its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order.
There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice, if you ever wish to become a Padawan.
You speak as if this were some foolish game! Have you no idea what is at stake?
With power comes responsibility, and only by learning discipline and sacrifice can we truly learn to master our potential.
I wish you luck in your training, apprentice. There is much you must yet learn. May the Force be with you.
Juhani was a... a dear companion to me for many years. We spent many nights together alone under the stars.
That will never happen again, thanks to you. Curse the Council for sending you, of all people, to speak to her! Could you have done nothing else?!
Why? Because the Council believed that my closeness to her might do more harm than good... and yet they send *you*, instead? And look what has happened.
The Juhani I knew deserved more than this! She deserved more from the Council, and more from you!
You... you did not even try, did you? Did it even occur to you that Juhani might have been saved? That she might be worth saving?!
I should kill you for what you've done! And yet I can't, can I? I am a Jedi, and we are sworn to protect all... even the likes of you.
Get... get out of my sight! The very thought of the Council... and of you... makes me ill.
Pardon me if I find your apology rather disingenuous. Juhani meant nothing to you, and the Council should have known better than to entrust her life to you.
Do not presume to tell me how I should speak of anything! They should have known better than to entrust such a task to you!
She had it coming, did she? She had it coming?!
You have done a great thing. One of our own had strayed, but you have returned Juhani to the Order. For this you deserve the highest praise.
I wish you a pleasant stay here on Dantooine. May the Force be with you.
You there! Padawan! Why are you not wearing the customary robes of the Jedi? Do you mock the honored traditions of our Order?
Bastila? I have heard of her. They say she has already mastered the art of Battle Meditation, remarkable in one so young. Though I have heard she has a foolish pride in her own talents.
But as for you... you claim you are not a Padawan? I find this hard to believe. The Force is strong within you. I can feel its presence.
If this is some type of jest, it is in very poor taste. The Jedi Order is not a subject for jokes.
No, I suppose you did not. I apologize.
Please forgive the abruptness with which I first greeted you. It was harsh, and perhaps unfair. My Master often warns me I must learn to control my emotions. I see I have much left to learn.
My name is Belaya. I have come here to further my learning in the ways of the Force. Many Jedi come here to train under Master Zhar.
Any who belong to the Order should surely know this. You must be neglecting your studies, Padawan.
I am looking to alter my lightsaber, and I heard about some caves.
I am still learning the Jedi Code.
I want to learn to use the Force, not listen to your philosophical babbling!
It's difficult, but worthwhile.
Why didn't you go to her, then?
I did my best. I'm sorry.
Should you be talking like that?
She had it coming, trust me.
Back off! I'm no Padawan! I'm <FullName>. I just came here with Bastila.
I believe you are mistaken. I am not a Padawan. I am <FullName>. I came here with Bastila.
I didn't come here to be scolded by you!
I am telling you the truth.
Are you a Jedi?
I...
Aren't you just a sweet little droid, yes you are!
You didn't come here to listen to my ramblings on the evils of the Czerka Corp., I'll bet! What can I do for you?
Be sure to come back every now and again. I'm always getting more inventory in. You never know what I might have in stock, and my prices are always better than those crooks at Czerka Corp.!
They're vermin, mostly. Leftovers from the Mandalorian Wars. They lost their armies and worlds and now wander the galaxy raiding weak farms and outposts.
Any reasonably well-defended base could withstand them. This Enclave, for instance, would never fall to them.
They do make trouble for the farmers though... They're almost as much of a burden on ordinary people as that damn Czerka Corporation! But I digress...
They are the scum who could not stand defeat and fled the final battles. They do us no credit.
Don't get me started on Czerka Corp.!
They've got a monopoly on half the galaxy already, and they do everything they can to keep anyone else from getting a foothold in their territory: extortion, bribing officials and government diplomats.
Not to mention driving up prices on essentials like food and water on distant colonies. I've heard stories of them letting people starve to death because they couldn't afford their jacked-up prices!
And since they've thrown themselves in with the Sith, things have only gotten worse.
The Sith are tangled up in an expensive war with the Republic. They need supplies, equipment, resources.
There's lots of opportunities for a company with no morals, like Czerka Corp., to make some major profits. Malak has given them exclusive trading rights wherever the Sith have control.
It's bad enough they're helping to finance the Sith war effort, but I've heard rumors of even worse stuff.
Slaving, pillaging planets of their resources, genocide of indigenous species. The Sith and Czerka Corp. seem like a perfect match to me. Ah, listen to me going on...
Excellent. As always, my selection is somewhat limited. Czerka Corp. has a monopoly on some of the suppliers.
But I'm sure you'll find all my inventory is of the highest quality... and I've got a few special items you won't find anywhere else!
Welcome to my shop. It is always an honor to have a member of the Order grace my business with their, uh... business. As you know, I have nothing but the highest respect for the Jedi.
Manaan - the planet that supplies kolto - seems to have stopped exporting and aren't explaining why. I'm sorry to act like a Czerka Corp. guy, but I'll need to charge extra for it.
The Sith have been fighting amongst themselves on Korriban. Someone told me they have been killing each other in their temples. Sounds like the inside of a Czerka Corp. office to me!
The damn Czerka Corp. has been driven off one of their worlds! This is most excellent news, and to celebrate, I'm offering a discount - this time only!
There was some fighting down by the Sandral estate, I heard. I hope it's not the Mandalorian raiders acting up again...
Or maybe even some forces sponsored by Czerka Corp.! But maybe I'm just being a bit paranoid...
I understand congratulations are in order! You've decided to join the Jedi rank and file! Jedi <FullName>!
Another fresh-faced apprentice ready to leap into Jedi training with both feet. Well, best of luck to you is all I can say about that!
It's always good to see another ally in the fight against darkness and corruption.
If there were more people like you around, an honest businessman could make a decent living, and companies like that damn Czerka Corp. wouldn't even exist! But listen to me...
How goes the training? I hear the life of an apprentice can be pretty rough, but you should be proud of what you're doing!
Welcome to my shop, feel free to look around. Take a break from the trials of Jedi training. Speaking of which, I hear you've heard about the kinrath caves - the lightsaber crystal caves.
Sorry, my mistake. But if you were going, hypothetically speaking, I'd have a little proposal for you. Hypothetically, of course.
Those kinrath caves are crawling with crystals. Valuable crystals. Sure, the Jedi use them to make their lightsabers. But it's not like they need them all, right?
I'd pay very handsomely for any crystals that happened to end up in my eager hands.
Bring me those crystals here and I'll buy them from you, no questions asked. You might want to keep one for yourself, though. You'll need it for your lightsaber.
But enough of this. I'm sure there's another reason you came in to my shop. What can I do for you?
It's not like you have to tell the Jedi Council what you're doing. And it's not like anyone's going to miss a few extra crystals, right? Anyway, think about it.
I have my sources. Anyway, I've got a little proposal for you.
You must be the one I've been hearing about... the new recruit, as it were. <FullName>, I think they said.
Another fresh-faced apprentice ready to leap into Jedi training with both feet. Well, best of luck to you is all I can say about that!
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Crattis Yurkal, proprietor of the general store here on Dantooine. Not much to look at now, I'll admit, but I'm in on the ground floor!
I mean, look at this planet - majestic fields, rolling plains, wide open terra firma. Elbow room - that's what people want.
Once word gets out, we'll have settlers and tourists from the galactic core just dying to come here.
And guess who'll be waiting for them? Not that blasted Czerka Corp., that's for sure! Not this time, no sir! This time it'll be Crattis Yurkal who makes the big bucks! But listen to me...
Greetings, my young friend. I assume you are not a member of the Order, as you are not wearing the traditional garb of the Jedi.
I think I'll be going now.
What have you heard about the Mandalorian raiders?
What do you have against the Czerka Corporation?
I think I'll be going now.
Maybe we could discuss this some other time.
Do you mean Czerka Corp. are allied with the Sith?
Worse? How has it gotten worse?
I'd like to see what you have for sale.
No, you must have me confused with someone else.
It's a deal!
Could I get in trouble for this?
I doubt the Order would approve of such a transaction.
How did you know that?
Greetings, young Padawan. Have you come seeking knowledge of the past? Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, or so they say.
As Chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, I find your quest for knowledge admirable. But I do not want to overwhelm you with the long history of the Jedi Order.
You should ponder the history of Revan; it contains many lessons you may need if we hope to defeat Malak and the Sith.
Your confidence is admirable, but you must guard against pride and arrogance. These lead to the dark side.
Revan's tale shows us how even the greatest of Jedi can fall to the dark side. You must always be on guard against the evil that dwells within you. Think hard upon this lesson.
May the Force be with you.
Greetings, young apprentice. Have you come seeking knowledge of the past? Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, or so they say.
I bid you welcome once more. I assume you have come so that I might continue my recounting of the recent history of the Jedi Order.
It pleases me to see a student who understands the value of history. I shall resume where we last left off.
I was telling you how Revan and Malak returned three years ago, at the head of a massive invasion fleet.
When we last spoke I had just told you of the Mandalorian invasion of seven years ago. The Republic sent their entire fleet to do battle with this new threat.
I have already told you of the war against Exar Kun and the damage it wrought upon the Republic and the Jedi Order. Even now we are still rebuilding from that terrible conflict.
Padawan, I must speak with you. You are now one of the Jedi, an Order with a long and glorious past... a past we should all be aware of.
As a chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, I feel it is my duty to share the history of our Order with the newly initiated. Unfortunately, our recent history is one of tragedy and bloodshed.
The Mandalorian Wars, the fall of Revan and Malak, the rise of the Sith: there are important lessons to be learned from these events if we do not wish to repeat the mistakes of our past.
As you wish. I will not force you to hear what I have to say, though I think it is unwise to ignore the lessons of the past. Perhaps you can return when you have more time.
This facility is a training academy. The archives here are restricted to those who have attained the rank of Master. We must protect overeager Padawans from being exposed to dangerous knowledge.
The pursuit of knowledge is a noble goal, but there are some things that require the wisdom of a Master to truly understand.
If you are seeking information on Revan, Malak and the Sith, I will gladly recount the recent history of our Order to you.
All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order. Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice:
There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
Knowledge of the code will lead you to the rank of Padawan, and knowledge of the Order and its history will guide you down the path of the light.
Of course I could not tell you the entire history of our Order; the Jedi have existed for thousands upon thousands of years. We are as old as the Republic itself.
Instead, I will begin forty years ago with the war of Exar Kun. Like Malak and Revan, Exar Kun was a Jedi who fell to the dark side and led an army against the Jedi and the Republic.
Exar Kun was defeated, but the war left both the Republic and our own Order severely weakened. For twenty years we struggled to rebuild, trying to erase the scars of the terrible conflict.
Twenty years ago the Mandalorians, aware the Republic was in a weakened state, began conquering small worlds on the Outer Rim. They were careful to choose only planets outside the Republic's jurisdiction.
After much debate, the Senate chose not to intervene. As long as the Mandalorians avoided planets that were members of the Republic itself, there would be no retaliation.
The Mandalorians stockpiled resources from their conquered worlds, preparing for a massive assault. Seven years ago they launched a simultaneous attack in three separate sectors of Republic space.
The Senate had no choice but to retaliate with the entire Republic fleet. The Mandalorian Wars had begun.
The Republic petitioned the Jedi Council for aid, but there were many factors to consider before we allowed ourselves to be drawn into another conflict so soon after the war with Exar Kun.
While the Jedi Council preached patience, there were many among our Order who were eager for us to join the battle. Two young Knights in particular demanded immediate action: Revan and Malak.
They rallied many of the Jedi to their cause and, against the wishes of their Masters, joined the Republic fleet battling the Mandalorians.
Revan was a brilliant military leader, and the Republic fleet began to win victory after victory. Four years ago the Mandalorians surrendered unconditionally.
Revan and Malak were heroes, the great saviors of the Republic. A third of the Republic fleet was under their direct command... and then something happened.
No one is denying that Revan was one of the keys to defeating the Mandalorians... but something happened out there on the Outer Rim.
Instead of returning after the war's end, the ships under Revan's command went deep into unexplored space. They claimed to be searching for the last remnants of the Mandalorian fleet.
All contact was lost. For many months it was assumed some great disaster had befallen the entire fleet. Everyone thought they were dead.
There were unsubstantiated rumors of Revan and Malak being seen on a number of different planets during these months - scattered sightings that were never confirmed.
Perhaps they simply went far beyond the edges of Republic space. Maybe they found previously undiscovered hyperspace routes to the ends of the galaxy. Nobody knows for certain.
Three years ago, Revan and Malak returned at the head of a massive invasion fleet. Revan had assumed the title of Sith Lord; the hero had become a conqueror.
Initially the bulk of the Sith force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan. With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers.
Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power. But what is more disturbing is the size of the Sith fleet itself.
Some of the ships in the Sith fleet are those that were under Revan's command during the Mandalorian Wars. But many more are of an alien design we have never seen before.
The source of this massive fleet is one of the many things about the Sith we cannot explain. It seems impossible to have created it in such a short time, yet we cannot deny its existence.

The source of the Sith soldiers is, unfortunately, much easier to understand. Initially the bulk of the force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan.
With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers. Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power.
For two years the Sith were all but invincible. Fortunately, Bastila and her Battle Meditation allowed the Republic to win a few key victories and kept the Sith from total triumph.
In desperation we set a trap for the Dark Lord. Bastila was with the strike team that tried to capture Revan, as you probably know. She was there at Revan's end.
That was nearly a year ago, but things have not improved. Malak has stepped in and assumed the mantle of Dark Lord for himself, though he is far from Revan's equal in strategy or tactics.
Still, his fleet continues to grow in both ships and soldiers. If we do not find some way to stop the Sith soon, Malak will overwhelm us with sheer numbers.
Your confidence is admirable, but you must guard against pride and arrogance. These lead to the dark side.
Revan's tale shows us how even the greatest of Jedi can fall to the dark side. You must always be on guard against the evil that dwells within you. Think hard upon this lesson.
May the Force be with you.
Well, you can hardly blame the Republic. The memory of war was fresh in everyone's mind, nobody was eager to relive the horrors in a campaign against the Mandalorians. But in the end it was unavoidable.
All things in time. You shall learn that history is an intricate weaving of many events. No one thing can be understood without the proper context.
Ah, you have come, young apprentice, at Master Zhar's bidding. He sees great promise in you... as do I.
The time has come for you to choose the color of your lightsaber. This color also reflects your demeanor and position within the Order.
A Jedi is not restricted to a single color. Rather, that color is a badge of pride for the Jedi path it signifies. Should you have an appropriate crystal, you may change your blade to anything you desire.
But first you should learn of the different paths a Jedi may take.
Blue is the color of the Jedi Guardian. This Jedi battles against the forces of evil and the dark side. They focus more on combat training and use of the lightsaber.
Yellow is the color of the Jedi Sentinel. This Jedi ferrets out deceit and injustice, bringing it to light. They focus less on combat and more on other skills and abilities.
Green is the color of the Jedi Consular. This Jedi seeks to bring balance to the universe. They mediate between other groups, using their powers to end conflict and preserve peace.
Which color and path do you believe yourself most suited to, apprentice?
Indeed. We shall see. I will now ask you questions, and your responses will indicate which class you lean most towards.
A woman and her small child are beset by a desperate-looking group of thugs. They are menacing her with weapons and she screams to you for help. What do you do?
Hm... Indeed. Very well, on to the next question.
You are in combat with a Dark Jedi allied with the Sith. There is a pause in the combat. What do you do?
Yes, I suspected as much. Now for the next question.
There is a locked door and your goal lies on the other side. What do you do?
I am beginning to see a pattern here, apprentice. I have a feeling about what you would be best at. But first, the final question.
You are the head of an Enclave on a contested world. The Dark Jedi have infiltrated and are causing unrest across the planet. What do you do?
Yes, I thought as much.
As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Consular.
Here is a green crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.
As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Sentinel.
Here is a yellow crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.
As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Guardian.
Here is a blue crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.
I'll be going now.
Don't worry. I'll find a way to stop the Sith!
What am I supposed to learn from this?
I will think on this, Master Dorak.
Yes, continue the tale.
I don't have time for this right now.
Where are the Academy's archives?
I seek knowledge of the Jedi code.
Very well... tell me the history of the Jedi.
I am eager to learn, Master Dorak.
I don't have time for this right now.
What about the Mandalorian Wars?
But we ended up in a war anyway.
What about Malak and Revan?
Did the Jedi join in?
Where did the Sith come from?
How did Revan fall to the dark side?
So Revan did the right thing.
What happened next?
Where did they disappear to?
How did Revan get so many followers?
Where did Revan get the ships for the Sith fleet?
How can anyone hope to stop the Sith?
So what happened next?
I'll be going now.
Don't worry. I'll find a way to stop the Sith!
What can I learn from Revan's history?
I will think on this, Master Dorak.
They should have protected them!
That sounds like a big mistake.
What does this have to do with Revan and Malak?
Why do I get set with a single color?
What positions are there?
What colors are there?
Green. The path of the Jedi Consular.
Yellow. The path of the Jedi Sentinel.
Blue. The path of the Jedi Guardian.
Stop the thugs and find out why they are attacking her.
Attack the thugs.
Help them flee.
Try to see a weakness in his technique.
Find out why he turned to the dark side and try to turn him.
Attack him again.
Knock.
Try to pick the lock.
Coordinate with the planetary government to identify the infiltrators.
Try to lure them out into a trap.
Hunt them down.
Smash the door down.
I... I took the loss of my droid much too hard. I feel I must apologize.
Unfortunately I have none to give, otherwise I would. But I still feel I must explain myself... I suppose I came across as a little odd.
I was much too attached to my droid... It was all that was left of my husband, you see. Maybe I thought that through the droid, my husband could live again... be with me still...
But I must. I was much too attached to my droid... It was all that was left of my husband, you see. Maybe I thought that, through the droid, my husband could live again... be with me still...
But I went too far. I could not see what was missing in living a normal life. Fortunately, in my grief I returned here and ran into Samnt - an absolutely fascinating man!
Well, if his ego is similarly halved he should be just about right.
Samnt and I got to talking and, well, we have a lot in common. I think we'll be seeing more of each other. It's funny how these things work out in the end. Maybe there is such a thing as fate, after all...
But I think we should be going now... we have so much more to talk about! I just wanted to thank you for what you've done for me, and what you tried to do.
Goodbye, and thank you.
I think we understand. Love can do strange things to anyone.
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
I don't know what I would have done if I had lost him!
It's just so good to have him back!
We're just going to go right home right now and celebrate, aren't we, my lovely little droid?
Don't worry, I'm going to hug you and oil you and care for you and make sure you never get away ever again.
Please kill me...
Ha! I guess that droid is really going to to serve his master tonight!
[sadly] Beep Boop-oop.
I don't think I've ever felt so bad for a droid before.
I'll be waiting for you, Master Jedi.
A reward speaks louder than words.
Damn right!
There is no need.
Not half the man I am!
Meh, I've seen better.
He doesn't look that impressive.
Yes, he seems quite nice.
No...
I...
It's...
I agree. Completely.
The Council has decreed you must not leave the enclave. Please return to your room.
The Council has decreed you may come and go as you please.
Dantooine is one of our last refuges. The Sith hunt us everywhere.
If you are seeking information, perhaps the Jedi Council will help. I am afraid I cannot.
I hear that the Sith torture Jedi prisoners until they give in to the dark side. I hope that never happens to me!
I fear it is only a matter of time before the Sith find us here, too...
Enjoy the time you have here on Dantooine. I think the Council might decide to move to a different world soon.
Please, do not disturb me, I have pressing matters at hand.
I heard that the Sith have destroyed Taris. This bodes ill for us...
Good day to you. I am afraid I cannot speak to you at the moment. I apologize.
I do not know what the Council has in store for me, but I will trust in the Force and the way of the Jedi to help me through whatever is to come.
I must give you my thanks. Because of you, I am once again welcome within the Jedi Order.
Quatra's injuries were not so severe as I first believed. I was foolish to believe I could harm a Master such as she with my... my clumsy efforts.
The fierce confrontation between us was nothing more than a part of my training. Quatra wanted me to understand the threat of the dark side, to see how easy it was to fall from the path of light.
Quatra's methods may seem strange, but I trust her wisdom. This lesson has been difficult, but I am better because of it. Humility is never easy to teach, but now I truly understand my own limitations.
You can't expect everything to get handed to you on a silver platter.
After our last battle, Quatra had nothing left to teach me. I needed time alone to explore the turmoil of my own spirit. Only then was I ready to follow a guide - you - back to the light.
When I left, Quatra knew her work with me was done. There are other disciples who need training throughout the galaxy, and she could not stay to see if I passed this most difficult trial.
With your help, I have passed this difficult trial. The Council now feels I am ready to continue with my training, though they have asked me to wait here for the time being.
I have spoken to the Council, and they have helped me see the truth. The truth about myself, and the truth of my actions.
I'm just glad I could help.
Did you learn anything more about Quatra?
The ways of the Jedi are strange indeed.
That's pretty harsh...
So where is Quatra now?
Have you spoken to the Council?
I greet you, Padawan. Members of the Jedi Order are always welcome in all the outposts of Aratech Droids. How may I serve you today?
I hear you have earned a name for yourself in racing speeders. I am sure that one such as you has many needs that I can hope to fulfill.
The Czerka Corp., the perennial rivals of my company, have suffered some major setbacks on the world of Kashyyyk, I hear.
Aratech will benefit greatly from this, I believe, and our benefit extends to our customers as well. Hopefully prices will fall in the near future. How may I be of assistance today?
I hear that there is much strife amongst the Sith as of late. It bodes well for the cause of the Jedi. How may I serve your needs today?
I greet you, apprentice Jedi. Master Zhar has informed me that your training is progressing most rapidly. I am honored to have such a promising pupil in my shop. How may I serve you?
I greet you, human. How may this outpost of Aratech Droids serve your needs?
I greet you, human. I am Karal Karr, owner of this outpost of Aratech Droids, Inc.
My protocol droids are not programmed to interact with customers, so should you desire assistance I can aid you.
Please return again soon to Aratech Droids, Inc. for all your droid needs.
Only that they have been a nuisance to the farmers and settlers in the region.
They do not have the resources to penetrate this base, so I do not know of them first-hand.
Is there something else I can do for you?
Explore my inventory at your convenience. Settler families have purchased all my droids, but I have many upgrades and other wares for purchase.
I think I'll be going now.
What do you know of the Mandalorian raiders?
Let me see what you have in stock.
Thank you again. I hope your mission for the Council goes well.
You're back. The Council said you might return to Dantooine... I'm glad you did. I wanted to thank you.
I almost didn't think the Jedi Council would give me a chance, but they said everyone was welcome to return to the light side.
I guess I never *really* believed in the dark side. This just feels so right. I can't remember the last time I felt at peace like this.
They said I have a long road ahead of me, but they made me a proper Padawan and I have a Master, now. I... I just can't thank you enough.
I'm glad you were there. I don't think I ever would have made it through the academy alive. And now I might actually become a Jedi someday.
Well, at any rate, I wish you well. May... may the Force be with you.
I guess so. You pointed me in the right direction, though, and I have to be grateful for that. The Sith certainly didn't have my best interest at heart.
I... guess, if that's how you want to look at it. The Sith don't support each other like the Jedi do... and I don't think that's a weakness at all.
You told me I should leave the Sith and seek out the Jedi. Well, I did. Everyone's been very nice... much nicer than I thought they would be.
Maybe you don't remember me? I'm Kel... Kel Algwinn. We, uh, met in the academy on Korriban.
You're certainly welcome.
I'm glad I could help.
The decision was yours, Kel.
You were too weak to be a Sith anyway.
Thank me for what?
Do I know you?
I am sorry, Padawan, I am unable to render assistance at this time.
I am sorry, apprentice, I am unable to render assistance at this time.
I am sorry, human, I am unable to render assistance at this time.
I am sorry we have nothing of value to give you as a reward. Our families have cut us off completely. Had the Council not taken us in, we would be foraging in the wilderness to survive.
We are waiting before the ceremony. Hopefully, in time, our fathers will agree to attend. If not, we plan to have a small, simple ceremony. You will be invited, of course.
The Council will let us stay here as long as we want, though I know Shen and I are both hoping our fathers will forgive us and welcome us back into their homes. If not, we will try to build a future somewhere else.
When I first met Shen, I feared our forbidden love was doomed to a tragic end. But thanks to you and the Jedi Council, our story ends in joy.
So... any wedding plans?
What are your plans now?
I'm just glad I could help you out.
What do YOU want?
Now, Samnt, don't be so rude. If it wasn't for this young Jedi, we wouldn't have met.
Rahasia and I cannot thank you enough for what you have done for us. Now we finally have a place to share our love, without fear of reprisals from our families.
Not yet, my friend, but perhaps someday soon.
We will stay here for the next little while... We are still hoping our parents will learn to set aside their differences and welcome us back into their homes.
If they do not, perhaps we will travel to Coruscant or the Core Worlds and make our fortunes there.
Rahasia and I can spend the rest of our lives together... All thanks to you.
Good luck to you both. May you find the happiness you deserve.
I wish you the best of luck, Shen. I hope you two find the happiness I once knew myself.
So... any kids on the way yet?
What are your plans now?
I'm just glad I could help you out.
Welcome back, young human. You are kind to spend time with a poor, old Hutt.
Welcome back, young apprentice. You are kind to spend time with a poor, old Hutt.
Welcome back, young Jedi. You are kind to spend time with a poor, old Hutt.
Greeting, young human. You are welcome in my humble abode, as are all others who deign to visit this poor, outcast Hutt.
Good luck to you then, in all your endeavors. Should you come back to me, I would be grateful for any conversation.
Hahaha! You are most perceptive, I see! Not many people can tell that at first glance.
But I know that is not what you meant. I labor under the misconceptions and biases against my species.
We have the unfortunate reputation, you see, of being criminals and murderers and worse...
But I am merely a businessman who has been cast out from his home in this most cruel war. Your Council has seen fit to grant me asylum here away from the dangers in this sector.
But enough about my troubles. What more would you have of me?
Alas, even a poor Hutt businessman is not exempt from the fires of the conflict that now rage between the Sith and the Republic.
The world my business was based on, Neka, was subject to a most unexpected and unfortunate attack by the Sith armada.
The space lanes were clear one day, then the next they were filled with Sith interceptors and closed to traffic.
I had under my employ - quite unwittingly, of course - certain transport pilots who knew ways to slip me past the blockade above that world.
That is the only means by which I managed to escape Neka before the Sith commander deemed it worthless and virus-bombed all intelligent life from it...
It gives one a new appreciation of the value of the... sometimes troubling Jedi Order.
Is there anything else you wish?
I am known as Shuma. I am one of the many who have been made poor and disadvantaged by this cruel, cruel war.
I must be going now.
You're a Hutt!
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
You must not fail in your mission, young Padawan. Find the Star Maps that lead to the Star Forge. This is the only way to stop Malak and his Sith followers.
You and Bastila are the galaxy's last, desperate hope. May the Force be with you in this quest.
You must not fail in your mission. Find the Star Maps that lead to the Star Forge. This is the only way to stop Malak and his Sith followers. You and Bastila are the galaxy's last, desperate hope.
But beware the dark side. Bastila will guide you, but she herself is young and new to the ways of the Jedi. You must help her as much as she helps you.
The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, young Padawan. We pray you are up to the challenge.
May the Force be with you.
Padawan, you have done well in discovering the Star Map hidden within the ancient ruins. But there is more you must do in the battle against Malak and the Sith.
We Jedi know victory over the Sith will not come through martial might. The Council has a mission for you, Padawan.
I have consulted our vast archives in an effort to discover the nature of this 'Star Forge', but all my efforts have been in vain.
Still, the Council are in agreement: the Star Forge must be found! Revan and Malak sought it out when they began their tragic fall; the Star Forge is surely a powerful tool of the dark side.
The Star Map in the ruins showed you four planets, but it was incomplete. It did not show the location of the Star Forge itself. We believe there may be similar Star Maps on other planets.
Each Star Map is likely a small piece of a larger puzzle. Find the Star Maps on Kashyyyk, Tatooine, Manaan and Korriban and we believe they will lead you to the Star Forge.
Ever brash, ever disrespectful! This is what we have pinned our hopes on?
Peace, Vrook. We have discussed this; there is no other choice.
The Jedi numbers have been ravaged by this war, by defections to Malak's cause and by Sith assassins. But we realize the importance of this mission.
Yet if we sent a company of Jedi Knights with you we would surely draw the full attention of Malak and the Sith, dooming your efforts to failure.
Secrecy is our best defense against the Sith, but it would be foolish to send you on this quest without someone to aid you, young Padawan.
Bastila will accompany you, for there is a powerful connection between you two... a connection that might be the key to unraveling the mysteries uncovered by Revan.
Keep the example of Juhani fresh in your mind. You may need a reminder of the dangers of the path that leads to the dark side.
And Juhani has also asked to accompany you. After long deliberation we have granted her request.
Juhani nearly fell to the dark side. Perhaps her presence will serve as a reminder to you of the dangers of that path.
Of course those who aided you on Taris will also come; they possess skills you may find useful in your quest. Remember that secrecy and discretion are paramount to your success.
You will not be able to hide the fact that you are Jedi, nor should you. But the true nature of your mission must not reach Malak's ears.
You may return here at any time. Dantooine will be a sanctuary for you, a safe haven. Here you can find supplies and whatever advice or other aid we may give you.
This was already explained to you. Your command of the Force makes you a threat to Malak. Eventually he will destroy you, and all the Jedi, unless you stop him first.
You can leave whenever you wish; the sooner the better. The longer you wait the stronger Malak becomes. But first a warning, young Padawan:
The lure of the dark side is difficult to resist. I fear this quest to find the Star Forge could lead you down an all too familiar path.
Your training is now complete, young Padawan. And perhaps now it is time we dealt with the matter of the dream you and Bastila shared.
When we heard of the ruins in your dreams, Master Dorak recognized it as one of a series of ancient structures here on Dantooine. This one in particular lies to the east of this Enclave.
We sent a Jedi to investigate... but he has not returned. Perhaps sending him in the first place was a mistake.
The Force is guiding you through your visions; it may be that exploring the ruins is a task tied to your destiny. That is why the Council has now decided you should be the one to investigate this.
The secrets to stopping Malak may be hidden within those ruins. You must investigate them and find what Revan and Malak were looking for.
That is most... unfortunate. She was always a model student and most eager to learn. I grieve that she had fallen to her passions.
Remember her example as well as that of Juhani: the dark side is not an enemy to be taken lightly.
We do not know. That is one of the things you must investigate. We... fear the worst.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Be sure to bring Bastila with you. There is a powerful link between you, and you will need to draw strength from each other during the trials ahead.
A Jedi must ever be seeking knowledge. What is it you wish to know?
We do not know. She was training here until your unfortunate incident with Juhani, then she simply disappeared...
We would like any word of her you may bring. I do not believe she has died, or fallen prey to beasts, but I worry that she may have done something rash.
She had always been close to Juhani, and her death may have hit Belaya... hard.
Is there anything else you wish to ask?
If Shen Matale is not returned to his father it may ignite a savage and bloody feud between the Matale and Sandral estates. We must not allow that to happen.
You should ask Master Vrook about that, Padawan. He is in charge of our relations with the settlers.
The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. You must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you.
Master Vrook may seem harsh and critical, but he understands the dangers that lie in your path. He wants you and Bastila to be fully prepared when you finally face Lord Malak.
I knew Revan as a promising young pupil. Revan was strong in the Force, but also headstrong and proud. Such traits are not unusual in a Padawan. Perhaps that was why I did not see the true extent of the danger.
Many of the young Jedi admired Revan, including Malak. When Revan set off to challenge the Mandalorians, Malak was the first to join the cause.
And when Revan fell to the dark side it was inevitable Malak would fall as well.
Revan was always the more powerful of the pair. When Revan fell we had hoped the Sith threat was ended. But Malak quickly assumed Revan's role and embraced the dark side as fully as his Master ever had.
You should speak to Master Dorak after this council. As Chronicler of this Academy, he can give you more details of these events. But we must concern ourselves with the present.
Now Malak leads the Sith armada against the Republic, hate and vengeance drawing him ever further down the dark path, fueling his powers until they have surpassed those of his old Master.
Only you and Bastila together can stop Malak now.
Bastila will be a great Jedi someday. Even among the Masters and the Council it is rare to find one so skilled in the art of Battle Meditation.
Bastila was there when Revan was slain. Did you know that?
Bastila herself does not like to talk about it. She was accompanying the strike team that confronted Revan when the Dark Lord was destroyed. Her role in the death of such a promising young Jedi as Revan upset her greatly.
But Bastila knew she had to set her personal feelings aside for the sake of the galaxy and the Republic. The Force is strong with her now, and without her skill in Battle Meditation we would have lost this war long ago.
The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. But you must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you.
Ah, you have returned, young Padawan. Have you discovered what it was that Revan and Malak sought in those ruins?
Lies! Bastila has already told us about this 'Star Forge' and the map you found!
Peace, Master Vrook. I'm certain the Padawan only meant they had not found anything beyond what Bastila would surely have told us.
This news of a Star Forge is disturbing. Action is required, but we must not do so in haste. We must discuss recent events in light of this new information.
We should consult the Jedi archives to see if there is any mention of this 'Star Forge' and what it might do. We must learn why Revan and Malak sought it out.
Return to your ship with Bastila and we will summon you when we are done.
I have heard that the Sandrals and Matales have agreed to cooperation in the construction of a new estate to house their children. Apparently a son of one family and the daughter of the other are getting married.
I also I hear that we have you to thank for this happy occurrence. I am glad that you are using the authority our Order wields to achieve some measure of good.
Rahasia Sandral and Shen Matale have come here seeking shelter against their families. The Council has decided to give it to them.
Their love for each other was being denied by overly possessive parents and we learned that it was only by your intervention that they managed to escape here.
While it is regrettable that the fences between the families were not repaired, it is good that these two young lovers can live their lives free of oppression.
We have heard that there was a close confrontation between the Sandral and Matale families by one of the southern estates earlier. We also heard that it was by your actions that direct conflict was avoided.
It is good to hear that you have learned the lessons of the Jedi Order well enough to avoid conflict when necessary.
There has been a report of a terrible battle near the Sandral estate to the south of the Enclave. Apparently a large force of droids attacked the estate.
The defending droids returned in kind. The attacking family was apparently the Matale family launching an attack on the Sandral estate.
Both entire families were slain, including the boy Shen who had been reported missing.
There was a mention that someone noticed one or more other persons leaving the battle area after the conflict had finished. You were in that area, were you not? Did you see something?
[Success] Is that so... I cannot find fault with your statement, but something in your manner is odd. But no matter, more pressing things are at hand.
You must always remember the destruction and chaos that the dark side can reap, and avoid it at all costs.
Good evening, apprentice. I trust your training goes well?
Very well. May the Force be with you.
A Jedi must ever be seeking knowledge. What is it you wish to know?
The Mandalorians have not hurt anyone before now. We thought they would keep their activities down with our presence here.
But it seems we were tragically wrong...
You may deal with the Mandalorian raiders should you meet them. It might be good training to test your fighting skills this way.
These raiders are a disgrace. No true Mandalorian would stoop to raiding farms when whole worlds were open to them.
Master Vrook may seem harsh and critical, but he understands the dangers that lie in your path. He wants you and Bastila to be fully prepared when you finally face Lord Malak.
I knew Revan as a promising young pupil. Revan was strong in the Force, but also headstrong and proud. Such traits are not unusual in a Padawan. Perhaps that was why I did not see the true extent of the danger.
Many of the young Jedi admired Revan, including Malak. When Revan set off to challenge the Mandalorians, Malak was the first to join the cause.
And when Revan fell to the dark side it was inevitable Malak would fall as well.
Revan was always the leader, the more powerful of the pair. When Revan fell we had hoped the Sith threat was ended. But Malak quickly assumed Revan's role, and has embraced the dark side power as fully as his old master ever did.
Now Malak leads the Sith armada against the Republic. Hate and vengeance for his master's death draw Malak ever further down the path of the dark side, fueling his powers until they surpass those of his old master.
Only you and Bastila together can stop Malak now.
And they beat my people so easily in battle...
Bastila will be a great Jedi someday. Even among the Masters and the Council it is rare to find one so skilled in the art of Battle Meditation.
Bastila was there when Revan was slain. Did you know that?
Bastila herself does not like to talk about it. She was accompanying the strike team that confronted Revan when the Dark Lord was destroyed. Her role in the death of such a promising young Jedi as Revan upset her greatly.
But Bastila knew she had to set her personal feelings aside for the sake of the galaxy and the Republic. The Force is strong with her now, and without her skill in Battle Meditation we would have lost this war long ago.
The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. But you must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you.
Is there anything else you would like to know?
All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order. Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice:
There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
I have faith that you will achieve the rank of Padawan soon. Master Zhar is most impressed with your progress. May the Force be with you, apprentice.
Bastila has told us of your discovery in the ancient ruins. The Council has decided it would be best if you complete your apprenticeship before you embark on any further investigations in this matter.
As grave as the Sith threat may be, we cannot allow you to leave here until your apprenticeship is over. The danger of the dark side is too great to send you out unprepared.
Master Zhar feels you are ready to begin the final tests of your apprenticeship. Return to us when you have completed your training.
It is most regrettable that Juhani could not be saved. We in the Council had high hopes for her in the future.
In every heart there is some means of redemption. Could you find none in Juhani?
[Success] Perhaps that was the case. It is most regrettable, indeed.
Perhaps that was the case. It is most regrettable, indeed.
Heed her example: all are susceptable to the lure of the dark side. We must always remain vigilant against it.
Go to Master Zhar and inform him that the grove has been cleansed. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.
It is good to see Juhani has returned to the way of the light. You are to be commended for your role in this. Your actions give us great hope for the future.
Go to Master Zhar and inform him that Juhani has returned to us. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.
Bastila has told us of a most unusual development. She claims you and she have shared a dream, a vision of Malak and Revan in the ancient ruins here on Dantooine.
These ruins have long been known to us, but we believed them to be merely burial mounds. Perhaps they are more than we first suspected, if Revan and Malak found something there.
[Failure] See? Dishonesty! We are taking an incalculable risk in even considering training this one!
You cannot deny what you are. These dreams are part of you. The Force is part of you, though a part you cannot yet control. But through training and discipline we can teach you to live as one with the Force.
She says that she felt your presence within the dream, the presence she has felt within you ever since...
Master Vandar!
... ever since Taris. It is not unknown for this to happen between two people strong in the Force.
Bastila has described this shared dream to the Council in great detail. We feel it is more than a dream. It is a vision. The Force is acting through you as it acts through Bastila.
You and Bastila share a powerful connection to the Force... and each other. This is not unheard of. Connections often form between Master and student, but rarely does a bond develop so quickly.
Whatever dangers may lie ahead, we cannot ignore the destiny that has brought you and Bastila here to us. Together.
You and she are linked, as is your fate to hers. Together, you two may be able to stop Darth Malak and the Sith.
But do not let your head be filled with visions of glory and power! Such thoughts are the path to the dark side.
The way of the light is long and difficult, as you must learn. Are you ready for such hardship?
Good. It is well that you see how important this is and have the devotion to follow it.
Understand that there is little choice in this matter, for you or us. Across the galaxy the numbers of our Order dwindle. We have sent many Jedi in quest of a way to thwart Malak's advance... many have not returned.
The Sith hunt the Jedi down like animals, ambushing and assassinating our brothers wherever they are found. We fear it is only a matter of time until they discover even this hidden refuge.
Other Jedi have fallen from the light and embraced the dark side, giving their allegiance to the Sith and Malak, their dark lord.
Perhaps our hope lies in the dream you and Bastila shared. The Council has come to the conclusion that you and Bastila must investigate the ancient ruins you dreamed of.
[Success] If Malak is not stopped the Republic will fall, and the Jedi will be hunted to extinction. The galaxy will enter a time of darkness and tyranny not seen for a thousand generations.
The lure of the dark side is not easy to resist. Malak's power grows as more and more planets fall to his conquering armies.
If Malak is not stopped the Republic will fall, and the Jedi will be hunted to extinction. The galaxy will enter a time of darkness and tyranny not seen for a thousand generations.
The Council has decreed that you and Bastila must investigate the ancient ruins you dreamed of... once the Council deems you ready.
Perhaps there you will find some clue, some explanation, of how Revan and Malak were corrupted. And perhaps there you shall find a way to stop them.
[Success] Hm, yes. Your devotion is most commendable.
You have a strong affinity with the Force. With such power comes great responsibility... and danger. You may wish to deny what you are, but the Council cannot turn a blind eye.
Neither will Darth Malak. Your strength is a threat to him. In time he will learn of you and the Sith will hunt you down. It is inevitable. Defeating the Sith is the only way to save yourself.
The Force flows through you like no student we have ever seen. But you are willful and headstrong... a dangerous combination.
Before we send you to investigate the ruins, you must be trained in the ways of the Jedi so that you can resist the darkness within yourself... within all of us. Otherwise you are doomed to fail.
[Success] We must begin your training at once. You have a destiny upon you that you must be prepared to face. The entire fate of the galaxy is upon you.
We must begin your training at once. You have a destiny upon you that you must be prepared to face. The entire fate of the galaxy is upon you.
I can only hope you will prove up to the task.
You must learn patience and discipline. The ruins are a place of corruption. The dark side is strong there. We cannot risk sending you there unprepared.
Sounds like a suicide mission to me.
I am ready to do the Council's will.
Good. Others will only slow me down.
Am I to undertake this task alone?
Great... Bastila again. Anyone else you want to stick me with?
Great... Bastila and the cat woman. Anyone else you want to stick me with?
There are others I want to join me.
Why should I risk my life to stop Malak?
When do I leave?
You can count on me. I will not fail.
I have found and slain Belaya. She had turned to the dark side.
What happened to the Jedi who went to investigate?
I will investigate the ruins right away.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
What happened to Belaya?
What should be done about the Sandral and Matale families?
Why doesn't Master Vrook like me?
Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?
I think I'll be going now.
Are you saying Revan was responsible for Malak's fall?
So Revan was stronger than Malak?
What can you tell me about Bastila?
I think I'll be going now.
Carth mentioned something about it.
I had no idea.
[Lie] No, I could not find anything.
We found an incomplete Star Map and mention of something called a Star Forge.
[Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.
[Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!
[Lie] No, I was somewhere else.
I must be going now.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
Why does the Council do nothing about the Mandalorian raiders?
Master Vrook doesn't seem to like me very much...
Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?
I think I'll be going now.
Are you saying Revan was responsible for Malak's fall?
So Revan was stronger than Malak?
What can you tell me about Bastila?
I think I'll be going now.
Carth mentioned something about it.
I had no idea.
I seek knowledge of the Jedi Code.
My training is progressing quite well.
[Lie] She was too evil to ever come back.
[Lie] She attacked without speaking.
I couldn't see a way to save her.
[Lie] I don't know what Bastila is talking about.
What?? How would Bastila know if we shared a dream?
I don't want to talk about it.
Yes... they seemed to be searching for something
I trust in your greater wisdom.
I am having visions now?
What are you talking about?
Are you saying I'm... joined with her?
[Lie] Of course, Masters. I seek to follow the light.
I will try my best.
Yes. I'm ready for whatever awaits me.
How can he be stopped?
[Lie] Do not fear Masters, I will not fall.
Jedi are turning to the dark side?
[Lie] Of course, Masters. Anything to further the light.
I don't know if I want to do this... it sounds dangerous.
I will learn your Jedi powers and defeat Malak!
It seems I have no choice...
Very well, I will help you.
I'm ready now. I accept this mission.
[Lie] I surrender myself to the will of the Council.
As you wish, Master Vandar.
We don't have time for this!
For good or ill, you are now a true Padawan. The time has come for you and Bastila to investigate the dream you shared. The secrets to stopping Malak may lie hidden within the ancient Dantooine ruins you both saw in your visions.
As you strive to defeat our enemy, you must always guard against the enemy within yourself.
The easy lure of the dark side is difficult to resist, and I fear this quest to find this mysterious Star Forge will lead you down an all too familiar path.
The Council has placed the fate of the galaxy within your hands. I pray both you and Bastila are able to emerge from this ordeal as servants of the light. May the Force be with you, young Padawan.
It is well that you are still alive, Padawan, in that you have not yet managed to fail us completely. Why is it that you are now bothering me instead of seeking out the Star Map?
You have a mission to attend to, Padawan. And as much as I may wish it otherwise, you are our only hope.
I find that... disturbing. It is our failings as teachers that enabled this to happen.
Do not give in to the same dark urges as she did or you may suffer a similar fate.
The Jedi Belaya would seem to have disappeared. She had a lesson scheduled with Master Zhar but did not show up.
I have heard someone say that she had been seen leaving the Enclave, but I do not know where she would have gone.
If you meet her, you may want to ask her why she left. We do not force anyone to stay here, so do not think to take that route.
Is there anything else, then?
Ah, Nemo. He was a brave and honorable man. He had great strength with the Force.
I would not have thought that kath hounds alone would be able to overcome him. Perhaps there was more...
But remember your task, Padawan!
The Sandrals and Matales have been at odds ever since they came to this planet. And have been making my life difficult the entire time, as well.
Now Ahlan Matale accuses Nurik Sandral of stealing his son, Shen. Nurik Sandral's own son Casus has been missing for a while now. We do not know what has happened.
Ahlan is rash enough, and stupid enough, to start a war over any imagined slight. We would resolve this, but we have too few Jedi to spare. It must be resolved peacefully!
Their estates are both located to the south of the Enclave - the Sandral fairly far. It would normally be your duty to assist in such matters, but your primary task takes precedence.
If you are stuck on the planet for a while you may investigate. I would recommend starting at the estate of Ahlan Matale.
Shen and Rahasia have been granted asylum here at the Enclave until they can find a way to deal with their families. I hear you had something to do with that.
It is the way of the Jedi to provide help to those in need, and you seem to have lived up to this duty. I congratulate you, Padawan.
There was a battle near one of the southern estate recently. Many people were killed. Do you know anything about it?
[Success] Hmph. Indeed. I cannot prove anything, but I have my suspicions. I will keep my eye on you, Padawan.
I see you insist on wandering the halls of our Enclave when you should be busy studying your lessons.
Hmph! Well, get along then! Maybe you'll find the time to do something useful.
I suppose such desires are inevitable, though I fear you may seek knowledge for which you are not prepared. Yet I will do my best to guide your quest.
So you heard about them, did you?
They have been harmless up until now. It is tragic that someone had to die before we took action.
You have our leave to deal with the murdering Mandalorian raiders should you encounter them.
If you find me overly critical, perhaps it is because you do not fully understand what is at stake. For fifteen thousand years the Republic has brought peace and stability to the galaxy.
Now the Republic may be destroyed because we, the Jedi, have failed them. Revan and Malak were paragons of the ideals the Order seeks to uphold, yet they succumbed to the temptations of the dark side.
When Revan fell, Malak took up the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith. Should Malak be stopped, what is to stop another Jedi from taking his place? This is the burden we Masters must carry.
Only through strict training and relentless lessons can we prevent the Dark Master from being reborn.
That is why the Order can brook no failure in our apprentices and pupils. That is why I can accept nothing but perfection from you.
Revan was once a promosing Padawan. But ever eager to learn more about the Force, Revan sought knowledge of ancient Sith magics, foolishly ignoring the dangerous lure of the dark side.
When the Mandalorian invasion came, Revan seized the opportunity it presented. Many Jedi flocked to the Outer Rim to follow the charismatic young Knight... and many fell under the sway of the dark side.
I do not believe Revan and Malak were corrupted on the Outer Rim. They had begun their journey down the dark path long before the Mandalorian threat appeared.
Here on Dantooine they discovered a sinister cave, a place where the strength of the dark side overwhelms the light.
Perhaps this discovery was what first corrupted them... or perhaps they sought the cave out because they were already corrupted.
Whatever the explanation, the Order was unable to turn them back to the light. Had the Council taken more decisive action in this matter, perhaps Revan and Malak could have been stopped. But in this we failed.
The Jedi Revan was a great warrior and a amazing general. Even Mandalore himself couldn't defeat him.
Bastila? The young Jedi holds great promise... and great danger. She can do much for both the Republic and the Council. Without her skill in Battle Meditation the Sith armada would have conquered the galaxy long ago.
But despite her command of the Force Bastila is still young. She is a Jedi, but she has not attained the rank of Master. The Council would do well to remember this before we lay the fate of the galaxy on her slender shoulders.
You would do well to focus more closely on your lessons. The Force is strong with you, but you need training and guidance in the ways of the Jedi, lest you suffer a fate similar to that of Revan.
You do not know the Jedi Code? Without knowledge of those doctrines all your training will be for naught! All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order!
There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
Learn these truths, apprentice... or we shall all regret the decision to accept you into the Order.
It appears that soon you will achieve the rank of Padawan. Master Zhar is most impressed with your progress. But I cannot help but wonder if you move forward too quickly.
I have heard what you have done, and how Juhani has been slain. I had hoped that this would not have to come to pass.
Could you find nothing in Juhani that could be redeemed?
[Success] I am skeptical of your methods and your intentions. But if nothing could be done, then that is the way of things.
I am skeptical of your methods and your intentions. But if nothing could be done, then that is the way of things.
Keep in mind the danger of the dark side, lest you fall into its grasp.
I must congratulate you on your actions. You have saved Juhani and brought her back into the Order, and have given us all great hope for your future success. May the Force be with you as you continue your training.
I am sorry, Master Vrook. I will go.
I have slain Belaya on Korriban. She was a Dark Jedi.
What happened to Belaya?
I have found the body of the Jedi Nemo. He was slain by kath hounds.
What can you tell me about the Sandral and Matale feud?
[Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.
[Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!
[Lie] No, I was somewhere else.
I must be going now.
I would like to ask some questions.
Why does the Council not stop the Mandalorian raiders?
Why are you always criticizing me?
You often seem angry with me, Master Vrook. Have I displeased you?
Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?
I should be going now.
What happened on the Outer Rim to corrupt Revan?
What can you tell me about Bastila?
I seek knowledge of the Jedi Code.
My training is going well.
[Lie] She was too far gone to the dark side.
[Lie] She didn't give me a chance.
I could not see a way to save her.
Good luck, my friend. May the Force be with you.
Hello. It is... good to see you again.
You are the one who suggested I rethink my path. And I have... and you were right.
It's been very hard to let go of all those thoughts... about power and strength and victory. I don't know if I'll ever be completely free of them.
The real irony is that, despite what the Sith Code says, I've never felt more free. I think I might... be able to find a little peace here. Finally.
That's... very tempting.
But I'm not ready to leave here, yet. And I don't belong on the path you have to take... I told you that on Korriban. It's still true.
But... perhaps you could come back, afterwards. I could certainly use a friend, then.
Oh. Well, that's too bad. I'm still grateful for what you've done for me, regardless.
I know. I can... see that about you. I'm not sure that we will meet again. Still... I can hope that is the case.
That's good. I look forward to that time. Perhaps we can travel together, then.
You know, I'd forgotten all about that until I spoke to you about it on Korriban. Strange, considering my hate for them is what made me leave the Jedi.
I think... I think I've got to help myself, first, before I can help anyone else.
Maybe once that happens, I can work with the Jedi to make a difference. They may work slowly, but they do make a difference, don't they?
You believe that? I believe that they're better than the Sith. The Sith bring more misery than the slavers ever did. I don't know why I didn't see that before.
I may not be able to change everything at once like I wanted to... but it would feel good to really help someone, for a change.
Maybe that's a reason to change. Maybe that's a reason to stay. I... I guess I'll see.
More than the Sith did. The Sith bring more misery than the slavers ever did... I don't know why I didn't see that before.
I don't know. I doubt it. Even if I wanted to, the Sith would never take me back. To them, I am a traitor.
But the dark side... that's a different matter. The dark side is not the Sith. I still feel its temptation strongly.
My emotions are so strong. Just the other day I nearly attacked a poor Padawan for tripping into me, nearly berated his clumsiness and weakness.
I didn't, thankfully, but it's difficult to fight off those feelings. How do you do it?
You jest, but I think I know how you really feel.
The one thing that made me come here was how hard I had to think to remember where I began and where Yuthura the Sith Master ended.
That wasn't the person I wanted to be, so how did I end up there? It... it will take some time for me to sort through that, I think.
That's the worst thing to hear... how hard it is. I suppose that's the honest answer. The dark side is the easier path for a reason.
And to think I took my advice to come here from you. Ha ha! Perhaps you should follow your own counsel sometime.
For now. They've been very welcoming... more than I expected. I met my old master. He... he cried when he saw me.
I was embarrassed to see his weakness. Old habits die hard. But... it felt good, too. It felt good to know he missed me, that he worried about me.
The Council said they would give me time to decide if I wanted to try again, if I was ready. I don't know. There's... there's so much that I've done.
It's not that easy for me. There's an... an ache inside me I just can't seem to quench.
My old master said he would start exercises with me again... slowly, when I was ready. He said my experience with the dark side could make me a very wise Jedi.
There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.
Those words never held such resonance for me until I returned. I'd... like some serenity, some harmony. Wouldn't you?
That's too bad. A little serenity might be useful considering the fate you have in store for you.
Yes, I suppose your fate still has much in store for you, just as I saw back on Korriban.
Then may the Force be with you, my friend. I hope we will see each other again.
I suppose I owe it to you, and to myself, to give the Jedi another chance. I'm not the foolish young girl I once was.
I suppose I have. It's still tempting, all that power... but I've had my fill of it and it wasn't enough.
Yes. Part of me just wants to forget it, to put it behind me... but that isn't right, either. I have to accept it and move on.
I did. You told me I should rethink my path, and I did. You were right.
What? What are you doing here?
Why don't you come with me? I could use you at my side.
We're not friends.
I don't know. I might not be coming back.
I'd be glad to be your friend, Yuthura.
What about all the slavers you wanted to fight?
Not really.
Maybe a little.
I think they do.
Do you think you might ever go back to the Sith?
I'm just a natural, I guess.
It's not easy.
I try. I'm not always successful.
I don't. I do what I like.
So the Jedi Council will let you stay?
I wouldn't worry about it so much.
That's not really my style.
If I had a choice, yes.
I've got to go.
I think you should at least try.
You've seen what the dark side can do.
You've got a lot to atone for, I suppose.
Yuthura! So you made it here after all.
May the Force be with you in your quest.
Shen Matale and Rahasia Sandral have fled their feuding families and asked for sanctuary here in the Enclave. The Council has granted this request.
I have heard that it was by your actions that they managed to escape, and I must congratulate you for avoiding a potentially dangerous situation.
I have heard there was some sort of large battle to the south of here between two families of settlers.
Apparently both the families were completely killed in the fight, along with their respective droids.
I find that most suspicious. Were you not in that area recently?
[Success] Perhaps, perhaps. That or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.
[Success] Hm, is that so... It is tragic that this had to happen to those families. Their children were in love, I hear.
Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders, or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.
Let this be a lesson against hate and violence: a Jedi must always be wary lest these lead to the dark side.
I have nothing left to teach you, Padawan, though a Jedi is ever learning. Even the Masters know their training is but in its infancy. Now is the time for you to seek wisdom outside the training chambers.
The lessons that yet await you are to be found beyond the walls of this academy. You should speak to the Council, Padawan.
Now that the first stage of your training is complete I am certain they would be eager to have you aid us in our struggle against Darth Malak and the Sith.
You have cleansed the grove of its dark taint, but at great cost. Juhani was a most promising student and could one day have been strong in the Force.
Do not dismiss what happened to her, however. Juhani was both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the lure of the dark side.
Keep this in mind always in the future, and do not forsake the path of the light.
You have done well, my pupil. The ancient grove has been purified, and Juhani's journey down the dark path has been halted. Because of you she walks once more in the light.
But though she was saved, do not dismiss what happened to her. Juhani is both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the dark side. As are we all.
She struck her master in anger during training, and injured her greatly. But it was Quatra's choice to test Juhani this way, and it seems to have made its point.
Juhani has been redeemed, and you have passed your final test.
Congratulations, apprentice. Or should I say congratulations, Padawan? You have proven yourself worthy of joining the Jedi. Let me be the first to welcome you as a full-fledged member of our Order!
The dark side still taints the ancient grove. Your lessons cannot continue until the spreading corruption of the dark side has been stopped. This is your task, apprentice. May the Force be with you.
Greetings, my young pupil. Your progress has been most remarkable so far. Are you here to continue your training in the ways of the Jedi?
Few mention those names around here anymore... but I suppose it is just as dangerous to deny they were ever part of the Order.
When I was still on Coruscant Revan and Malak often came to me for additional training. In particular, Revan's hunger to learn seemed insatiable. I should have recognized this as a warning sign.
But I perceived the young Padawan's lust for knowledge as simple exuberance and eagerness. Revan was my most promising pupil, one I felt sure would someday become a champion of the Jedi Order.
The Jedi Order moved too slowly for Revan and Malak; we were too cautious in their eyes. They always sought to learn far quicker than their Masters felt was prudent.
It is one thing to understand a lesson, but to truly comprehend it takes a wisdom that only comes with time.
Several years ago, when the Mandalorian threat first arose, Revan and Malak were eager to journey to the Outer Rim to defeat the enemy of the Republic.
But the Council felt it best if we moved with care and caution. The true threat, the Council feared, had not yet revealed itself.
But Revan would not be dissuaded. Charismatic and powerful, it was inevitable many of the Order would flock to Revan's seemingly noble cause.
Malak was the first to join his closest friend. Others soon followed, many of our youngest and brightest, intent on saving the galaxy from the Mandalorian threat.
They were foolish to disregard the Council's wishes. I do not know what happened to Revan, Malak and their followers on the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim, but something corrupted them.
Their ideals became twisted, their spirits were tainted and they fell to the dark side.
There is a lesson in this, a lesson you would do well to take to heart: the dark side can corrupt even the most noble of Jedi.
You have learned much, yet there is much more for you to still understand. The way of the Jedi must be entered into with a clear and focused mind.
When you feel you are ready to continue your training, know that you can find me here.
For every Jedi the threat of the dark side is always present. You must truly understand this before you are accepted into the Order. You must see the corruption of the dark side for yourself.
Even here on Dantooine there are places where the dark side holds sway, twisting and tainting nature itself.
The ancient grove once used for deep meditation by the Jedi is now tainted, a wave of darkness perverts the region around it.
The kath hounds in the area have become savage and ruthless. They have become a threat to the settlers, a threat the Jedi have promised to stop.
The kath hounds are but a symptom of the true problem. You must journey into the grove and confront the true source of the darkness. That is your task.
I can say no more; some things you must see for yourself. None of the other Jedi at the academy are permitted to help you in this task.
But remember this, my young apprentice: a Jedi acts with patience and care, and those on the dark path are not always lost forever.
Soon your apprenticeship will end and you will be granted the title of Padawan, the lowest rank of those within the Jedi Order. Yet first you must prove yourself worthy.
In the traditions and customs of our Order, as handed down from Master to pupil for a thousand generations, you must successfully complete three tests before you earn your place among the Jedi.
These tests will see if you have truly mastered the training you have been given, both mental and physical. Upon completing these tests you will pass from apprentice to Padawan, and join in the ranks of the Jedi.
First I will test your knowledge of the Jedi Code. These tenets must always guide your actions, in everything you do you must always be conscious of their wisdom.
You must now prove you have a Jedi's understanding of the Code by completing these fundamental precepts of our Order:
There is no emotion...
That is not correct, apprentice. Perhaps you are not yet ready for this challenge.
There is no shame in admitting weakness. Feel free to speak to the other Jedi in the academy if you require assistance. They will gladly share their knowledge with you.
Return when you feel you are ready for this challenge. May the Force be with you.
There is no ignorance...
There is no passion...
There is no chaos...
There is no death...
You have learned your studies well, apprentice. It will not be long before you are a full member of our Order.
But first you must pass the second test, and learn about the most prized possession of a Jedi, the very symbol of our Order: the lightsaber.
The lightsaber is the traditional weapon of our Order. It is a symbol of a Jedi's skill, dedication and authority, and each lightsaber is as individual as the Jedi who wields it.
The blade is made of pure energy, focused by polished crystals in the hilt. As the second test, each Jedi must construct his lightsaber with his own hands.
And now it is your time. Speak with Master Dorak and he will guide you through the choosing of a crystal.
The blade is made of pure energy, focused by polished crystals in the hilt. As the second test, each Jedi must construct her lightsaber with her own hands.
You have done extremely well in constructing your lightsaber, apprentice. Your crystal seems to have been set perfectly. It is rare indeed for that to happen the first time one constructs their lightsaber.
These crystals are very rare, found only in certain caves strong in the Force. By adding crystals to your lightsaber you can alter or enhance its properties.
There have even been unconfirmed rumors of certain Force-sensitive caves here on Dantooine that may hold these crystals.
Your lightsaber identifies you as a member of the Jedi Order. With such recognition comes honor and respect... and the attention of dangerous enemies.
The Sith and Dark Jedi will seek to destroy you, apprentice. And you must prove yourself worthy in battle against a foe who also wields a lightsaber.
Are you ready to face the final challenge, apprentice?
They can modify simple things, such as the color of your blade, or complex ones, such as crystals that reputedly increase the strength of the beam.
But you must learn first to use your lightsaber and take care when drawing it.
It is a rumor only. I do not know if there is any truth in it.
Ah, so you are the one who rescued Bastila. It is appropriate you are here. We have been discussing your rather special case. I am Zhar, a member of the Jedi Council.
With me are Master Vrook, Master Vandar and, of course, the Chronicler of our Academy, Master Dorak. Padawan Bastila I am sure you are already familiar with.
Indeed, I am sure that you do. I assure you that we will have answers for you.
Darth Malak seeks to destroy the Jedi Order. Our most effective weapon, perhaps our only hope, is Bastila's skill with Battle Meditation.
With this power she can swing the tide of nearly any battle in our favor. Which is why Malak was seeking her so fervently.
And if he could not have her, he would see her destroyed. Taris was just in the way.
We need Bastila in our fight against the Sith. Indeed, we need every Jedi we can muster, since the Sith have been hunting us down at every opportunity.
Which brings us to you...
Yes, the High Council of the Jedi Order is on Coruscant, but we are the Council in charge of the training facility here on Dantooine.
This is no trap. The Council just wants to talk to you. There is much that needs to be discussed.
Bastila tells us you are strong in the Force. We are considering you for Jedi training.
Master Zhar speaks out of turn, perhaps. We need indisputable proof of your strong affinity to the Force before we would even consider accepting you for training.
Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this woman... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...
Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this man... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...
Perhaps it was simple luck.
We both know there is no luck. There is only the Force. We all feel the power in Bastila's companion, though it is wild and untamed. Now that this power has begun to manifest itself, can we safely ignore it?
The Jedi training is long and difficult, even when working with a young and open mind. Teaching a child is hard. How much harder will it be for an adult to learn the ways of the Jedi?
[Success] Traditionally the Jedi do not accept adults for training, though there are rare exceptions in the history of our Order. But you are a special case.
Such pride! Such arrogance! Ach. This one is already on the path to the dark side!
As are many who are not given proper training, Master Vrook. Only through our guidance can we hope to lead those who have strayed back to the path of the light.
Traditionally the Jedi do not accept adults for training, though there are rare exceptions in the history of our Order. But you are a special case.
I agree with Master Dorak. Many of our own pupils are leaving the Jedi order to follow the Sith teachings, we need recruits to stand against Malak! With Revan dead...
Are you certain Revan is truly dead? What if we undertake to train this one, and the Dark Lord should return?
We should discuss this matter more fully in private. Bastila, you and your companion must go. This is a matter for the Council alone.
As you wish, Master Vandar. We shall return to the Ebon Hawk and leave you to your deliberations.
Do not worry. I am confident in your ability to learn.
Ah, good. Now that you have selected your crystal, we shall begin the construction of your lightsaber.
You should speak to Master Dorak. He can assist you in selecting your lightsaber crystal.
[Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.
[Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!
[Lie] No, I was somewhere else.
I want to ask some questions, Master Zhar. Questions about Revan and Malak.
I should be going now.
What happened?
What happened to this noble mission?
Yeah, yeah, get on with it.
I will heed the lesson, Master Zhar.
They disobeyed the Jedi Council!
Not right now.
I am ready to continue my training.
What's causing this corruption?
You know more than you're telling me...
Do you have no other guidance?
You want me to go kill kath hounds?
What would you have me do, Master Zhar?
Let's get these tests over with!
There is harmony.
There is peace.
There is knowledge.
There is peace.
There is serenity.
There is harmony.
There is the Force.
There is justice.
There is the Force.
There is knowledge.
There is serenity.
There is the light.
What kind of tests are these?
I am ready for the tests, Master Zhar.
Should I know anything else about lightsabers?
I need more time to prepare myself.
I am ready to face the third trial.
What will these crystals do for me?
I can find crystals on Dantooine?
I've got some questions for all of you.
Why did the Sith destroy Taris?
I feel I'm not going to like this...
Me? What about me?
Why am I here?
Why am I a special case?
Isn't the Jedi Council on Coruscant?
So you've drawn me into your little trap, Bastila. What now?
What do you want from me?
Strong in the Force?
[Lie] Of course, great Jedi. I will learn your ways and follow the light.
I am ready to accept the training... and my age has nothing to do with it!
I am willing to try my best.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Nothing would give me greater honor than learning the ways of the Jedi.
It's so different here, so alive. I can't remember seeing green on Tatooine
I wish Ward could have come here with us. I miss him.
You've helped so much. It's good that I can tell my children that there are nice people in the galaxy.
Thank you again. We've got a chance now, and it's all because of you.
Hello there, I... it's you! I remember you! You're the one that gave me the credits to leave Tatooine! I could never forget your face.
Thank you so much for what you did. Here on Dantooine, we've got a chance.
Er... all right then. But thank you again. I couldn't have made it here without you.
Thank you. I won't trouble you any more, but... thank you.
I found a small apartment for now. They're resting now. They're still getting used to the new surroundings.
Once I'm working I'll see about getting them into school. There are opportunities here they would have never had on Tatooine.
Well, I may be able to get hired as a servant for one of the influential families here. I haven't yet, but I'm sure I will.
At least there's hope here. Tatooine was just dying, all of it.
Yes, yes, I have to go.
I'm glad I could help.
Where are your children?
Sharina, wasn't it? What will you do here?

Dantooine - Courtyard
I...
Aren't you just a sweet little droid, yes you are!
My droid is still missing. I can feel him like a hole in my aching heart.
Please, if you come across my droid, bring him to me. I need him so much...
He is out there still? I must find him!
[Success] My droid... destroyed? No, no! This cannot be happening! I can't bear to live without him!
Greetings, young Jedi, I wonder if you could assist me. I seem to have lost my... companion, you see.
Please, I beg of you, I must find him. How can you leave him out there with so many dangerous beasts and predators? Have you no humanity?
Please, if you do see him, return him to me. He is so far from home... He is a C8 model droid about a meter and a half tall...
Well... yes... he is a droid.
But he is very valuable to me all the same! He is the last piece of my poor, passed-away husband that I have left.
He is very dear to me, my precious is. I don't know what I'd do without him!
He's the only companionship I have on all of Dantooine!
He is a personal assistance droid. My husband was a genius at constructing droids. He made this one capable of taking care of me for the rest of my life.
As the last legacy of my husband, for my own personal ease of mind, I need him back! His absence gnaws at me like a gaping wound.
Please, I beg of you, return my droid to me!
Please! Should you find him, send him home to me!
Thank you! Thank you, master Jedi! If you find him, please send him home to me. I need him so much!
Wow. She really misses her droid, doesn't she?
There is no need for you to make fun of her. She is obviously desperate.
I'll say.
Carth! Enough!
Beep! Beep-beep boople boop!
Oh, I'm sorry, master Jedi, I did not give you a proper introduction. I am Elise Montagne. I own the farm to the north of here.
But I really am in need of your assistance. Time may be critical with so many kath hounds about. Oh, and those Mandalorians! Please, will you help me find him?
We were working on my farm to the north of here. I was working in the garden outside, and he was working inside.
I heard the door to the house open, but not close. I went to see and found it wide open!
I searched everywhere, and could not find him! I worry so much. I need him back so badly. I wonder if he... Could he have been kidnapped?
Not that I know of... Er... *ahem* None of my neighbors really know he's there.
Kath hounds are not intelligent enough to open doors. Although they have been more vicious lately...
No, it must have been someone who could open the door by himself. Come to think of it, the door was locked!
Well... Yes, it could have. But he had no reason to run away! His programming...
He was supposed to be completely loyal! To serve me after my husband died!
Beep! Beep-beep boople boop!
No, the door was undamaged and showed no signs of tampering...
Maybe it was the Mandalorians... or maybe kath hounds. But... no...
I am sorry, I must be going.
Do not worry, I will find him.
Could you tell me what happened to him?
Your droid escaped and is nowhere to be found. He's still out there somewhere.
I am afraid your droid had to be destroyed.
[Lie] I found your droid... but he had been destroyed by kath hounds.
I am sorry, I have no time for this.
No means no.
You expect me to run off to find some stupid droid??
A droid?!?
Your missing companion is a droid??
What exactly did you use him for again?
You live alone with this... droid?
I am not interested.
If I happen to see him, I will send him back to you.
I will help you find your droid.
Yes, Teethree, I understand that you're concerned about him, too...
Alright, I will help you. Tell what happened.
Who are you?
Your companion?
Does anyone hold a grudge against him?
Could it have been kath hounds?
Could it have been opened from the inside?
Yes, Teethree, I understand that you're concerned about him, too...
Could someone have bypassed the lock?
Did someone break it down?
It is possible...
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
I don't know what I would have done if I had lost him!
It's just soo great to have him back!
We're just going to go right home, right now, and celebrate, aren't we, my lovely little droid?
Don't worry, I'm going to hug you and oil you and care for you and make sure you never ever get away again.
Please kill me...
Ha! Better get used to it, droid!
[sadly] Beep boop-oop.
I don't think I've ever felt so bad for a droid before.
I'll be waiting for you, Master Jedi.
No...
I...
It's...
I agree. Completely.
It is relaxing to come outside and enjoy the fresh air once in a while. It relieves stress.
If you are seeking information, perhaps the Jedi Council will help. I am afraid I cannot.
Dantooine has a splendid environment. I would hate to see it damaged by too many settlers.
I fear it is only a matter of time before the Sith find us here, too...
I hear that the Sith have defeated another Republic battlefleet. I do not know how much longer the Republic can last.
Please, don't disturb me; I have pressing matters at hand.
The kath hounds have been very active of late. The settlers feel they are becoming more dangerous.
The kath hounds seem to have calmed down. The settlers must be relieved.
Good day to you. I am afraid I cannot speak to you at the moment. I apologize.
Thank you for exacting my revenge on those Mandalorian beasts. If only I could have been the one to tear out Sheruk's heart.
Now those Mandalorians know what it's like to be hunted!
But now that you've killed some of them, they won't stop until you've defeated their leader. You must find him and kill him, too.
Thank you, young Jedi.
Have you found the Mandalorian raiders yet?
Please! Find them and destroy them before they kill anyone else!
Not much that would help you, I'm afraid. They're Mandalorians in their battle armor with some Duros allies. They came down on us on landspeeders, so they could be anywhere by now.
One thing I do remember when those dogs killed my Ilsa, is that their leader was a giant of a man... who wielded a lightsaber.
Mandalorians have never been open to your ways. They are much too barbaric and violent.
I rather think that it may have been from some poor Jedi he had slain before. You can see now that he is as much of a threat to you as to me! You must kill them!
They have been troubling farms in the south most recently, having already dealt with many to the north. Please go there, find them and kill them!
Practical.
Yes it was. Mandalorians have never been open to the ways of the Jedi. They are much too barbaric and violent.
Please, help us if you can! They are as much a danger to you as to us! It is only a matter of time before they come here...
Good, good! Put them down like the animals they are!
Thank you, young Master. My daughter can now, I think, rest in peace.
Here is the reward I promised you.
Wha... what? I did not think the Jedi were so greedy. You seem almost Mandalorian.
I thank you for what you have done for me, but I have nothing else to give. The Council will hear of your deeds... and your greed.
No, please, take it. This pitiful amount will never be enough for what you have done for me.
Again, I thank you. I will be sure to tell the Council of your great deed.
Are you a Jedi? How long can you people continue to sit by and claim you protect us?
Protectors? Ha! You sit in your Enclave safe from the Mandalorians while we suffer!
No! They've been raiding planets across this sector, and farms around here often.
You Jedi have left them alone because they haven't harmed you, but they steal our property, destroy our land, and worse!
I say we look for these Mandalorians. I fought them in the war... they're nothing but vicious pirates. We should... we should stop them if we can.
Perhaps we should look into this matter. I was unaware of any Mandalorian activity here, myself.
Is that an impersonation of Bastila? If it is, it's a good one.
Carth, I'm standing right here.
And? What's your point?
Wow, talk about an ego trip! You Jedi aren't perfect; remember Revan and Malak? Maybe these Mandalorians are worth looking into.
Those Mandalorian brutes have killed my daughter!
They came to our land, demanding our livelihood. But Ilsa, my Ilsa, said no...
She was always impulsive... *sob*
There was nothing I could do... Too many of the Mandalorians and their Duros allies...
I've come here to ask you, please, master Jedi, stop these raiders and get revenge for my daughter.
Please, I beg of you! Find the Mandalorian raiders and destroy them so my daughter can rest in peace!
I will give you all I have, just please, annihilate them from the face of this planet!
But you have been accepted into the Order. Yours is the authority of the Jedi.
You should have protected her better. And you call yourself her father.
And what am I supposed to do against a dozen Mandalorians and Duros? Nothing... There was nothing I could do...
I will come back if I find their leader.
No, I have not found them yet.
What do you know about these raiders?
What does this mean?
He was Jedi?
A lightsaber??
I didn't say I was going to find them!
I killed some of them on the plains.
I fought and killed their leader.
What?? That's it? Give me more!
There is no need for a reward.
Thank you, Jon.
Mandalorians? They were all beaten in the last war.
We are Jedi. What we decide is always right.
What are you talking about?
You didn't try to stop them?
Only an idiot says no when they have a gun in their face.
They killed her?
Revenge is never a good reason.
Your problems are not my concern.
Those animals! I'll kill them for what they did to your daughter!
I will protect you and your fellow settlers.
Maybe you could make it worth my while.
I am not a Jedi yet.
You return, yes? What else do you wish from me?
Ah, yes, you are a Jedi. I am grateful that your people harbor me in my times of need.
Yes, yes. Jedi always have more to attend to. Good day, friend Jedi.
After my flight, all I have left to give is my thanks, which your Order gladly has.
I am a victim, a refugee, yes. I flee... fled from my world once the Sith fleet comes. They bomb my world, destroy it, yes?
They scour the continents, boil the oceans. Sith are bad, yes.
But I run here, find the Jedi already here, unknown. They take me in... one left of a billion, yes...
The Republic fights, but does not win. Not you to blame, of course, no. The Sith are strong and destroy those who would oppose them, yes.
My thanks you have, and your Order. Is there anything else you require?
I must be going now.
You might give something back...
What happened to you?
It is good, sometimes, to stop and reflect on the beauty of nature and the Force.
How go your studies, my young friend?
I am sorry, I tend to get carried away... I do not believe we have met, apprentice. My name is Nemo.
Is there something I can help you with?
I hope your time is well spent here on Dantooine.
About me? I am truly flattered. What is it you wish to know?
*chuckle* The importance you put in a name is misleading, young one. You of all people should remember that.
I am here by the will of the Jedi Council. I serve the good and, hopefully through that, the people of the Republic.
Is there something else I can help you with?
As I have said, I believe, my name is Nemo. I am here by the will of the Jedi Council.
Indeed, my young friend, that I am. I have served the Council for many years, and have seen many apprentices pass through this Enclave.
I think, perhaps, you place an undue importance on rank and hierarchy. Understandable, but regrettable also. We each serve in our place, high or low.
Very well, what is it you wish to know?
Ah, yes, those caves. Those caves are dangerous for the unwary.
Kinrath spiders infest the places. They are attracted by the colors and heat given off by the crystals, I think.
It is a pity... Those caves are strong with the Force.
Mandalorian raiders, yes. They have been preying on the settlers in the surrounding farms. Stealing food, money, weapons... Jon was hit really hard recently... He lost his daughter.
They were not a problem before... But now it would seem prudent to be rid of them. If you could accomplish this, it would not harm your training and the settlers would greatly appreciate it.
Jon is currently waiting to petition the Council. He is on the path north of here. He might be able to tell you more about what had happened.
Can I help with anything else?
You Republics are too weak. You should protect what you want to keep, otherwise someone stronger will take it.
Perhaps, perhaps. But not everyone in the galaxy is a warrior like you.
Ah, you can find two stores here at the Enclave. Aratech has opened both a general supply store and a droid facility and I think you will find their products quite good.
The supply store is run by a Twi'lek name Crattis Yurkal. A talkative being with a big chip on his shoulder, but generous despite that.
The droid repair facility is managed by Karal Kaar. A bit brusque, perhaps, but a good being nonetheless. We have shared many a game of Pazaak in the small hours of the morning.
Is there something else I can help you with?
Indeed. What is it you would like from me?
Very well.
The Council has told you nothing of the grove?
Do not be so quick to judge circumstances about which you are ignorant. Not everything may be as transparent as you would believe.
Then it would not be my place to explain its significance.
But as the light side can be embodied in living beings, so can the dark.
The grove can be found to the south and east in the plains. But be wary of kath hounds, they may be agitated by the power in the grove.
The Code is a way of life, not a strict set of laws. It would be wise for you to reflect on them, rather than rote memorization.
But still you must learn.
There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is peace. There is no death; there is the Force.
Live by these precepts and you will not fail, young apprentice.
Is there something else I can help you with?
Greetings, Master Nemo. It is good to see you again.
And you, dear one, as always. Have you learned to control your temper yet, girl... or does your master still douse you with a bucket of water?
Ahhh... well, it is --
As I thought. Don't worry, young one... you shall learn, in time. Have patience.
Juhani has been slain, I hear. You fought with her in the grove?
Even in the darkest heart there is hope for rebirth. Anyone can be turned back to the light. Anyone.
It should not have had to go that far... but some things cannot be avoided.
You would do well to mind Juhani's tragic example and not to let yourself fall into the sway of the dark side.
I hear you managed to return Juhani to the Order. Congratulations.
I regret not being able to tell you more, but some things you must see with your own eyes.
I must be going now.
I would like to know about you.
What kind of a name is Nemo anyway?
What do you do here?
I would like to ask you something else.
Who are you?
You are a Jedi?
I want to ask you something else.
Are you a member of the Council?
I have a question about Dantooine.
Master Zhar said there are caves on Dantooine with lightsaber crystals.
I've heard people mention Mandalorians.
Where can I find a store?
I have been given a task by the Council...
Um... never mind.
What do you know of the tainted grove?
I know it is tainted by the dark side.
No, they have not.
I want to know about the Jedi Code.
She deserved to die.
She had been turned to the dark side!
She attacked me.
Please be careful on the plains, Padawan. Kath hounds are about.
Please be careful on the plains, apprentice. Kath hounds are about.
I don't understand why the Jedi Council are hiding here. Shouldn't they be helping the Republic?
I hear the Sith have been beating the Republic pretty bad. They must've spent the whole time building ships since we beat them last time.
Those damn Mandalorians have been raiding farms all over this continent. The Jedi won't do anything, so where does that leave us?
I heard the Jedi finally got off their behinds and did something about the Mandalorians! Took them long enough!
The Council's been telling us not to go near the stones to the east. Just as well, the kath hounds near there seem a lot more vicious...
You know those stones to the east of here? I heard they did some digging and found they aren't natural.
Rahasia Sandral is a nice young woman. But her father has been keeping her at their estate since her brother went missing...
I heard there was fighting coreward towards Coruscant. I wonder if the Republic will survive...
Ahlan Matale likes to lord his wealth over the rest of us. What I wouldn't give for him to eat his own words... His son seems like a nice boy though.
Did you hear? Shen Matale and Rahasia Sandral are getting married! I would never have thought their fathers would allow it!
The children of Nurik Sandral and Ahlan Matale apparently fled here to the Enclave. Their families are both very mad.
Ahlan Matale locked himself up in his estate with his son. I wonder what the boy did.
Did you hear? The Sandrals and Matales massacred each other! It's horrible!
Master Quatra was hurt very badly. She might die. I heard it was her own apprentice that did it.
I heard another Republic fleet was wiped out in this sector! I hope they don't find the Jedi here!
Did you hear about the young Jedi girl from a couple days ago? I heard she hurt her master pretty bad...
One of the Jedi managed to turn that Dark Jedi girl back to the light side. That's a relief!
I heard the rogue Jedi girl was killed. Good riddance! We don't need any Dark Jedi here on Dantooine!
Hello. I'm afraid I'm not very good at explaining things. If you have any questions, please ask my husband.
I hope the Jedi Council will listen to Gar. If they don't, I don't know what we'll do...
How may I be of assistance?
Farewell, then. May the Force be with you, is that how it goes? Yes, may the Force be with you.
My name is Gar. Me and my fine wife Rilka here...
A pleasure.
... live on one of the northern farms. But the kath hounds and the Mandalorian problem has been getting really bad of late, and we're here to ask the Jedi Council to help.
Well, as you can see here, Dantooine is mostly plains and grassland, but it has nice hearty soil. A lot of new people have come in the last generation or so.
Hm... the ones you'll most likely hear about are the Sandrals and Matales. Big, wealthy land-owners, both of them.
But Ahlan Matale and Nurik Sandral just can't seem to get along, and now Ahlan wants to get the Council to do something.
Well... from what I hear it started about a week ago. See, Nurik's son Casus is an archeologist, bright lad too, but he disappeared. Nurik of course blamed Ahlan, but even he didn't take it before the Council.
But now Ahlan's son Shen has disappeared as well... and no one knows where he's gone. Ahlan blames Nurik. He thinks he's kidnapped his son.
I don't know exactly what he wants to ask the Council, but from what I know of Ahlan, he's probably going to be after blood...
Ever since the Republic beat them years ago, little groups have been roaming all over the place.
With the Sith invasion, the Republic doesn't have the manpower to hunt them down.
The Jedi are even worse off because Malak has been hunting them specifically.
They're worried that he might even be supporting these raiders, so don't want to face them directly. That puts us in a kind of hard situation.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
They're pathetic. They're taking scraps when they should be taking worlds.
Recently the kath hounds have been acting much more aggressively. They've even attacked some of the settlers!
Those Mandalorian raiders have been milking the outlying farms dry, too... I hear Jon got hit really bad. Too bad about his daughter.
I'm not sure exactly what the Council will do about it, but we need some help with this. I only hope they'll listen to me...
Is there anything else you require?
His daughter was killed by Mandalorians when their farm was raided. He's been taking it pretty hard. If you want to ask him about it, he's just north of here. It's not my place to say anything else.
Is there anything else you require?
He should have been protecting her better if he wanted to keep her.
Mandalorian beast! Some of us don't like fighting and killing and butchering as much as you!
Don't be so heartless, Mandalorian.
How may I be of assistance, Master Jedi?
Ah, but you are still a Jedi.
Greetings, friend. I think I can safely assume you are a member of the Jedi Order. Has the Council agreed to hear our petition?
Ve... very well. Thank you, Master Jedi.
Oh, I see. I am mistaken.
Ah! Yes, thank you, Master Jedi.
Stay here Rilka, I'll be back in an hour or so.
Yes, dear. Good luck.
Ah. I'm sorry. I was mistaken.
Does the Council require our presence?
I must be going now.
What can you tell me about Dantooine?
Who are you?
Are there many farms here on Dantooine?
I would like to ask you something else.
Do something? Has something happened?
Mandalorians? Here?
You mentioned kath hounds?
What about Jon and his daughter?
I am not a Jedi Master yet.
I don't know anything. Leave me alone.
I am sorry. I do not know.
Yes, they are waiting for you now.
I am merely an apprentice, not a Jedi.

Dantooine - Matale Grounds
Until you find Shen, Jedi, we have nothing further to discuss. I suggest you hurry south to their estate, lest I take matters into my own hands.
I've seen men like Ahlan Matale before. He's so convinced that his hatred is justified he's prepared to do anything. And if we don't intervene, there will be war.
Fathers can be blind sometimes. There is more to this.
This guy's a real pain! It wouldn't surprise me if Shen ran off just to get away from his father!
I'm afraid Ahlan is not just making idle threats. He is rash and foolish enough to attempt a full assault on the Sandral estate. Such action would result in all-out war between the families.
My protocol droid tells me you are here on behalf of the Council. I was beginning to think my demands had been ignored.
Though I think your time would be better spent interrogating the Sandrals as to the whereabouts of my son Shen!
Proof? How dare you talk to me about proof! I have more than enough to satisfy any reasonable person!
I have already told my story to the Council! Why did they not inform you of my circumstances? I did not expect such incompetence from the Jedi, but I shall repeat the tale once more...
Many years ago I brought my family here to Dantooine to escape the crush of humanity on the Core Worlds.
Soon after we settled here, the Sandrals arrived. And they have been a plague upon my house ever since!
The injustices the Sandrals have committed against the Matales are far too numerous to name, but the Council is well aware of our many disputes.
Recently, I discovered several Sandral droids trespassing on my land.
My own security droids destroyed the invaders - not a single one survived.
I have no idea what nefarious purpose lay behind their arrival - my own assassination, perhaps. Destruction of my property. Maybe a simple spy mission. I wasn't about to find out.
It was shortly after this incident that Shen, my only son and heir to the Matale estate, vanished.
Obviously Nurik, the unscrupulous head of the Sandral clan, has abducted my son in retaliation for the destruction of his droids!
Follow their stink south of here and you shall find them. I demand action on this matter, Jedi!
Why does the Council insist on stalling? The life of my son is at stake! Is it possible... yes, of course. Now I understand.
I am a man of the world, Jedi. I know how things are done. I will make a... contribution... of 1,000 credits to the Council in exchange for rescuing Shen from the Sandrals.
I will present the credits directly to you, of course. Whether the Council ever learns of this "donation" is completely up to you.
Two thousand? Your greed is outstripped only by your utter lack of any sense of proportion, Jedi!
For that price I could purchase enough droids to destroy the entire Sandral estate. Two thousand is out of the question.
Two thousand? Even if he would pay such a fee, what could you possibly need so many credits for?
You must not give in to your baser desires. The lure of the dark side is strong.
Nevertheless, my offer still stands. A thousand credits for Shen's safe return. Know, however, that I will not sit idly by much longer.
Eventually I will take whatever action is necessary to rescue my son... including razing the entire Sandral estate!
You would be willing to risk open war over this?
It is the Sandrals who have started this. Not I.
And here I thought you would blame us, if we failed. It seems everyone is responsible for your actions except for you.
I don't need to stand here and listen to such impertinence!
I'm impressed, Carth. That interjection was very Jedi-like.
What can I say? You pick up a few things.
The only resolution possible is the immediate return of my son!
I have no idea what nefarious purpose lay behind their arrival - my own assassination, perhaps. Destruction of my property. Maybe a simple spy mission. I wasn't about to find out.
My own security droids destroyed the invaders - not a single one survived.
[Alarmed] Beep beep!
At least you're efficient.
Somehow I imagine the story from the Sandrals would sound just about the same, don't you?
You can't accuse the Sandrals without proof.
Any information you might have would be helpful.
Why are you so certain the Sandrals are to blame?
What happened to the droids?
Where can I find the Sandrals?
You are jumping to conclusions.
Make it 2,000 and you have a deal.
I understand you are upset, Ahlan Matale. Rest assured I will find Shen.
The Jedi cannot be bought! I will remain neutral despite your attempted bribe!
I shall go and speak to Nurik Sandral.
What were they doing here?
Err... no, I don't think the droids were very frightened, Teethree.
Jarg, did you remember not to take the XT-model bike out today? There was something funny with one of the intakes, and I thought it could jam.
Ha! Consider yourself lucky! If someone was dumb enough to take that thing out he would have ploughed right into the ground within a kilometer.
Master Matale is grateful for the return of Shen. He has sealed the estate and cannot see you, however. Please move along.
[Angrily] Beep beep-eep!
I do as I am told. Insults will get you nowhere.
[Angrily] Beep!
So this is how nobles show their gratitude. No wonder all my friends are soldiers.
Figures. We get his son back for him, and now the stuck-up estate owner won't have anything to do with us!
Master Matale has left orders to deny you entrance into the estate. He suspects you to be in league with the Sandrals.
A grievance will be filed with the Council for your actions.
I am sure the Council will realize these accusations are completely unfounded. The Matale grievance will fall on deaf ears.
Return the young Master Matale to this estate. His father may order preemptive action if this is not done.
This is private property! By what authority are you trespassing on this estate?
I am programmed not to respond to threats until attacked directly. I have been programmed to defend myself accordingly.
But even if I am terminated, another will take my place. You will still be denied entrance.
And don't think I wouldn't enjoy blowing you to bits.
Leave immediately. Only those on official family business are permitted within the estate.
These settlers have come to Dantooine seeking privacy. Perhaps we should respect their wishes.
You have come from the Jedi Council? Master Matale wishes to speak with you. I will inform him that you are here. Remain at this location until he arrives.
My weapons are my authority!
I'm sorry, I'll be going now.
I come on behalf of the Jedi Council. I wish to speak to Ahlan Matale.

Dantooine - Grove
Yes? Is there something I can do to help you in this investigation?
Are you certain? It would be beneficial to your training if you were to at least make the attempt.
By assisting me with this case you may learn much about how well you have learned the wisdom of the Jedi... or how much further you have yet to go.
If you give up now, I will take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself. But you will have missed out on an excellent opportunity.
Very well. I will take these two suspects to the Enclave and judge this case myself.
May the Force be with you.
Good. We Jedi are often called on to rule in difficult cases such as these, yet if we do not have experience with them our wisdom is of little use.
We should provide what help we can. Surely it is not that difficult to ascertain the truth.
We should assist Jedi Bolook as best we can.
When you have gathered all the information you need, come back to me and we can try to determine what happened.
So to add to all this, Handon as much as admitted he would have liked to assault Calder because Calder was in some sort of relationship with Handon's wife.
Rickard, on the other hand, insists that everything between himself and Calder was going great. He was becoming quite beligerent about the fact too.
What sense does all this make? Who killed Calder Nettic?
A bold conclusion... one most people would not arrive at. But we are not like most people, we are Jedi. Still, I would like to know how you came to this conclusion.
What? How could that have worked?
Yes, well done! Both men had a reason to want Calder dead. This is my theory of this morning's events: both men knew Calder would be out here this morning and each plotted to kill him.
Handon would have dropped his blaster - the one we found at the scene covered in blood. He probably thought Rickard was going to kill him so he called us, hoping he could convince us it was Rickard.
And I would have got away with it if it wasn't for you meddling Jedi!
But why did Rickard shoot Handon?
That is not a reason. I find your logic severely flawed. I think it is rather likely that he thought it was Calder that he was shooting.
I think it rather likely that he thought it was Calder that he was shooting.
Maybe he thought he was shooting Calder?
Yes, that would make sense. He did have a motive to kill Calder as well. He most likely did think that it was Calder he was shooting at. He might have even thought he succeeded.
Damn you! Damn both of you!
That is enough. The culpability of both of you in the murder - and attempted murder - of Calder Nettic is evident. Additionally, Rickard Lusoff can be charged with aggravated assault and attempted murder of Handon Guld.
I place you both under the arrest of the Jedi Order, and will escort you to holding facilities in the Jedi Enclave.
You have done well here, it is obvious you have been studying your lessons carefully. I will be sure to inform the Jedi Council of your performance in this little test.
Good day, and may the Force be with you.
[happily]  Beep-beep boop!
You did good. You might just make a proper Jedi yet, who knows?
Well done. I am impressed... I'm not sure I could have done as well.
What?? I wasn't in anything with that fool Handon! The man I shot... uh...
See! I told you!
It appears that Mr. Lusoff has incriminated himself enough. I believe we have found the killer.
Good, good. I assume I am permitted to leave now?
A Jedi does not exploit their position! Have you learned nothing during your training?
The judgment has been rendered. You may leave, Mr. Guld.  For now.
What! No, dammit!
Yes, Mr. Lusoff? Is there something wrong? Do you not feel justice has been done here? Do you not feel you should be taken to the Enclave for sentencing?
No! If I'm going, I'm going to take him with me! You don't know anything about what happened!
Yeah, I came out here to kill Calder. The Hutt-spawn was funneling credits from our business and we were going under because of it.
But if I'm getting caught, I'm not going to go down by myself! You two idiots let the real killer go!
It seems you were a bit rash in your investigation. You should have examined the relationship between Calder and Handon more thoroughly. Surely we could have found some evidence of this.
Yes, you green-skinned nerfherder!
I came out here to kill Calder and when I saw someone over by the bridge I shot him. But Handon had already killed him!
I will return to the Enclave with Mr. Lusoff, and I will have Mr. Guld apprehended. It is a minor inconvenience, but one well worth the cost if you have learned a lesson here.
I realized your judgment was incorrect, but I allowed you to make it so you could understand that there are always consequences to our actions. As a Jedi you must always remember this.
What?? What are you talking about? I don't want that bantha of a wife Handon has!
Shut your mouth! I'll kill you just like I... er...
Just like he killed Calder!
It appears that Mr. Guld has incriminated himself enough. I believe we have found the killer.
I can leave now, then?
That is a most unbecoming attitude for a Jedi. I will be sure to inform the Council of it.
The judgment has been rendered. You may leave, Mr. Lusoff. For now.
What! No!
Yes, Mr. Guld? Is there something wrong? Do you not feel justice has been done here? Do you not feel you should be taken to the Enclave for sentencing?
No! If I'm going, I'm not going alone! You don't know what you've done!
Look, I came out here, I admit, to kill Calder, but so did Rickard! He must have thought it was Calder when he shot, and hit me!
So I'm going to prison, but I shouldn't be going alone! Did you idiots have to let the slime-ball go?
It appears your investigations were incomplete. I imagine if we examine the business records we will discover Calder had been cheating Rickard.
Yes, you tentacle-headed moron!
I came out here and killed Calder, but Rickard was here to do that too and he shot me by mistake!
I will return to the Enclave with Mr. Guld in custody, and I will also have the authorities apprehend Mr. Lusoff. It is a minor inconvenience, but one well worth the cost if you have learned your lesson here.
I realized your judgment was incorrect, but I allowed you to make it so you could understand that there are always consequences to our actions. As a Jedi you must always remember this.
Interesting. And why do you believe that? What possible motive could he have had?
Hm... that is a possibility, but unlikely. There is no evidence of a weapon at all, other than Handon's.
I do not believe that was the case. The facts in this investigation do not point towards such a motive. There are too many facts that point towards other possibilities.
I have no idea upon what you based that assumption. I assure you that no facts in this case point towards that possibility at all.
Yes, I believe that has some truth in it. It would be quite a motive for him to seek revenge upon Mr. Nettic.
And so you have made your judgment in this case.
An interesting theory, but what do you base that on? What possible motive could he have had?
Yes, I concur. That is a good motive for Handon to have. And Handon being the killer matches with the facts of the case as presented so far.
And so you have made your judgment in this case.
I do not believe that was the case. The facts in this investigation do not point towards such an event taking place. There are too many points that show intent for it to be a random killing.
I do not believe your logic is up to the task of deciding who is guilty in this case. I will take these men to the enclave and deal with this matter myself.
Do not despair. Although you couldn't solve the case you handled yourself in a manner befitting a Jedi. Once you have more training and experience I am certain you will be able to handle matters such as this.
[Failure] Do not try to use mental powers on me, human! I am far more advanced in my training than you!
I will take the suspects to the Enclave to judge them myself. Rest assured, I will give the Council a full account of your actions here.
[Failure] No, you have done what you can already, and it appears to be beyond your abilities. Perhaps with more training you would have done better.
[Success] Hm. You have been of great assistance already. Perhaps it was merely a mistake on your part.
Very well, you may yet discover who committed this crime. Who do you believe killed Calder Nettic?
Possible... but we have found no weapon anywhere. He could have dumped it in the river, but that is unlikely because it would have damaged the weapon.
I do not believe that was the case. The facts in this investigation do not point towards such an event taking place.
I assume the blood on the weapon belongs to the victim, but I want to be thorough. What have you learned about the blood on the weapon?
That is surprising. So the blood must belong to one of the suspects. But which one?
Rickard had said that he had previously twisted his ankle moving to the body. While I am not a specialist on human physiology, it does not seem that this sort of injury would result in blood loss.
Where does the truth lie?
Why do you believe that?
Hm... perhaps. We should examine him more closely then.
Hey! Quit it! *grumble*
Rickard does not seem to be bleeding. I am not sure that it would have been possible to get his blood on the weapon.
Why don't you check that Calder slime-ball, now that you've already roughed me up!
Why do you believe that?
Hm... Handon has been moving oddly since I arrived... Perhaps we should examine him a little more closely.
Hey! What are you doing!
There is blood! Handon appears to have suffered some sort of blaster wound to his side.
But if he was injured, who shot him?
That does not prove anything. You cannot assume somone's guilt except based on the facts we have observed.
It seems you are letting your personal biases influence you on this case.
I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.
I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.

[Failure] No, I do not have any more time to waste here. I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
[Success] Hm... Perhaps I should not take it to the Council so soon...
Yes, I believe I was hasty. You may have one more chance to figure out who the murderer is before I take the suspects back to the Council.
You do not seem to be as adept at human nature as I had first assumed for one of your species. If you do not determine something more valid soon, I will be forced to return with the suspects to the Enclave.
If you are unable to deduce the facts of this case, then I will take the suspects back to the Enclave and handle it myself. But since you have talked to the suspects, there is no harm in you trying further.
Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving what I could not. Where does the truth lie?
So, what have you determined about the weapon found by the body?
Handon says that the blaster was his, but that it was stolen from his home several days ago.
Rickard says that the blaster was not Calder's, and implies that if Calder was out here, it was either without a weapon, or his was taken.
Where does the truth lie?
Why do you believe that?
It seems unlikely that he would be. In fact, his explanation seems to make sense. The weapon is not owned by Calder, but rather by Handon.
Records show Calder possessed a heavily personalized Echani Mk 4 light blaster weapon, which was also not found near the body.
While he may not have had it on him at the time of his death, it does not contradict anything Rickard has said.
You should not use fabrication to replace true evidence.
Perhaps he could have. But Handon said he arrived before Rickard, and Rickard was seen coming out of the rocks.
You should not try to complicate a situation in order to arrive at a more uncertain guess.
True, but the blaster was Handon's, and he said it had been stolen. This, unfortunately, opens the possibility of a third party.
I do not relish that thought, and it somehow seems wrong to me. Additionally, Handon said that the weapon was already there when he arrived, and Rickard already had one.
It was not Calder's, so there must have been another person with the blaster. Presumably, this was the person who shot him.
Why do you believe that?
Perhaps, perhaps not. You speculate that he killed Calder. Indeed, that is what this investigation is about, but we deal only with concrete evidence.
Handon says that he came upon the body immediately before Rickard arrived, and Rickard did not see Handon approach in the short time it took to move from the rocks.
I find I cannot agree with your theory in this case. You should not try to fabricate situations to replace true evidence.
Yes, Handon's story does seem to have a major flaw in it: The weapon was not reported stolen.
It would seem very odd indeed that Handon would not have reported it, given the importance of weapons to survival on the plains of late.
Hm. We are nearing the end of their stories, but are still not much closer to finding the culprit than we were before.
Perhaps you should discuss the stories with both men some more.
You should probably inquire with both men about the blood found on the weapon.
Perhaps the blood on the weapon will yield more results.
True, but as we have already determined, that may be out of stupidity, rather than any malicious intent.
You should not fabricate motives to replace true evidence.
I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.

If you are unable to deduce the facts of this case, perhaps we should go to the Council instead. But since you have talked to the suspects, there is no harm in you trying.
Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving what I could not. Where does the truth lie?
You should probably check about the weapon with the information droid. It may be able to confirm your evidence.
Our information is incomplete. You should probably inquire about the weapon with both men.
Next, Handon said he was just out running, but is probably lying because all settlers should carry weapons out on the plains and Handon had none. Rickard said he was out hunting iriaz.
Handon told me he barely knew the victim. On the other hand, Rickard and the victim were business partners.
However, according to Rickard they got along quite well. On the surface, neither man seems to have a motive for killing Calder.
Where does the truth lie?
Why do you believe that?
Your personal feelings towards the man should not influence your decision in this matter.
There is no emotion, there is peace. If you let your emotions rule your judgment you will be of little use in cases such as these.
You should try to remain objective in this.
I do not believe Rickard was lying about being in business with Calder. We have a record of that, fully registered and licenced.
It seems you are having trouble seperating the facts from wild guesses. Maybe I was mistaken in believing you were ready for this case.
It is not unusual for business partners to disagree sometimes, but if he found proof Calder was cheating him things could escalate to violence.
You theory does not seem to have much basis in the facts that we have hear so far.
Why do you believe that?
I have no idea what evidence you could base that on.
It is strange that Handon should be here at the exact time of the murder.
But, no, that is not any sort of firm evidence to prove that he was stalking Calder. It could still be simple chance.
Supposition does not equal evidence.
Well, that certainly is a motive for murder. The case is taking shape; however, you mustn't jump to any quick conclusions. Perhaps we should now focus on the murder weapon itself.
Supposition does not equal evidence.
I'm afraid you lack the wisdom to solve this case. Perhaps you need more training. In any case, I shall return with the suspects to the Enclave and deal with this myself.

You do not seem to have learned your lessons as well as I would have hoped. If you do not determine something more valid soon, I will be forced to return with the suspects to the Enclave.
If you are unable to deduce the facts of this case, I will have to take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself. But since you have talked to the suspects, there is no harm in you trying a bit more.
Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving this. Where does the truth lie?
The Southwood company's record did say that Calder and Handon had rented a landspeeder together several times.
This shows that he did, in fact, know the victim. But this hardly counts as a motive for murder. I'm afraid I can't accept your judgment on this point.
You might want to see what information the witnesses and the information droid can provide you about the blaster found near the body.
This is getting too complicated for my limited understanding of humans... What could possibly have happened here?
It is most confusing.
We know Rickard lied about the sun blinding him while he was shooting, but we need more to go on. Let's examine the relationship of each man with the victim.
Now we must determine the relationship between each man and the victim. It would be a great help if we could find a reason either of the suspects would want Calder dead.
Rickard said that he shot the iriaz, which fell to the ground, but at the place it fell he found Handon standing over Calder's body instead.
Where does the truth lie?
Why do you believe that?
What? That is not proof that is an assumption. We are dealing with strictly facts here, and you would do well to remember that.
You should try to remain objective in this.
He may have lost sight of the location when he was coming out from the rocks or he may not have noticed Handon coming. But it may also be that he has not told us something.
It does not constitute firm evidence, however.
We have already determined that Rickard may not have been where he said he was, and we know that there was no dead iriaz present at the scene.
But we have no reason to doubt this part of his story. He could well have shot at it and had it run off.
It does not constitute firm evidence and does not contradict anything said so far.
Why do you believe that?
I believe you are prejudiced against him because of that fact. While it is true that he would have trouble running any great distance or for any length of time, he may still have been running.
It does not constitute firm evidence. You would do well to remain impartial and not let personal biases interfere in this.
You should try to remain objective in this.
We have no evidence of that.
He could have come out here with the intention of meeting Calder, but there is no proof of that.
It does not constitute firm evidence. It is an opinion based on too little fact.
I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.
I cannot stay any further for this waste of my time. You are getting no farther than I was in this case. I shall return myself and the suspects to the Enclave for the Council to judge this crime.
I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
[Failure] Do not try to use mental powers on me, human! I am far more advanced in my training than you!
I will be sure to report your attempt to the Council when I wait there for their judgment.
[Failure] No, I do not have any more time to waste here. I thank you for what little assistance you could give.
[Success] Hm... Perhaps I should not take it to the Council so soon...
Yes, I believe I was hasty. You may have one more chance to figure out who the murderer is before I take the suspects back to the Council.
You do not seem to be as adept at human nature as I had first assumed for one of your species. If you do not determine something more valid soon, I will be forced to return with the suspects to the Enclave.
If you are unable to deduce the facts of this case, perhaps we should go to the Council instead. But since you have talked to the suspects, there is no harm in you trying.
Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving what I could not. Where does the truth lie?
It is odd that he would be out running alone, without a weapon for defense of any sort.
He would have to either be stupid or suicidal, and he does not appear to be the sort who would be either.
Hm... neither of these stories fits very well. There may be more to this murder than we had thought.
Very well. We should start at the beginning. If we find the truth behind each piece of the puzzle, we will no doubt resolve the case.
Handon said that he was nearby and heard a shot and ran over, only to find Calder already dead. He said Rickard came out of the shadow of the rocks holding a blaster in his hands.
Rickard said that he was hunting iriaz, saw one through the glare of the sun and shot at it.
But Calder was shot 3 hours ago, and there was cloud cover all day that only broke after I had arrived.
Obviously one of these men is not telling us something, but where does the truth lie?
Perhaps you should examine the witnesses' stories more closely. Also, you can always speak with the information retrieval droid to gain access to data from the Jedi Enclave that pertains to the case.
Why do you believe that?
Rudeness and anger are signs of the dark side, and can indeed lead down the path to murder. But they are not indicative. They do not prove he has done anything.
I do not believe this is definitive evidence. It appears to be a reaction to his attitude, not to the facts of the case.
Yes, well done! It was very cloudy this morning. If it had happened as Rickard said, the sun would not have been visible at the time of the killing. You seem to have caught Rickard in a bit of a lie.
It seems I was correct in assuming you could help me with this case. This lie doesn't prove Rickard is guilty, but I think you have taken the first step in unravelling this mystery.
We should proceed on to the next point. We need to find a motive for the killing. Maybe you should talk to the men about their relationship with the victim.
There are plenty of iriaz on the plains here. As a Jedi, you should be more aware of your environment. One only has to observe the surroundings to notice them.
I do not believe this is definitive evidence.
Why do you believe that?
It does seem very convenient that Handon was in the area at exactly the right time.
But stranger coincidences have been known to happen.
I do not believe this is definitive evidence. It could be simple chance.
True, he didn't mention it, but he didn't deny it was there either. It simply had no bearing on the question as asked.
I do not believe this is definitive evidence. What he said was not directly false.
That... is a novel assumption. The degree of corpulence in an individual has not been scientifically linked to honesty and I find your adherence to that belief... remarkable.
It does not, however, constitute evidence.
I'm afraid you lack the wisdom to solve this case. Perhaps you need more training. In any case, I shall return with the suspects to the Enclave and deal with this myself.
I'm afraid you lack the wisdom to solve this case. Perhaps you need more training. In any case, I shall return with the suspects to the Enclave and deal with this myself.
Never fear. The wisdom of a true Jedi is not something that grows over night. It must be cultivated with years of training and study. May the Force be with you.
[Failure] Do not try to use mental powers on me, human! I am far more advanced in my training than you!
You are obviously not ready to handle this case. I will return to the Enclave with the suspects and handle this myself. And you should return to your lessons, for you have much to learn.
[Failure] No, I do not believe you have the wisdom to solve this. But do not despair; even in your failure here there is an important lesson for you to learn. Good day, and may the Force be with you.
[Success] Hm... Perhaps I should give you another chance. Patience is something the Order tries to instill in us all.
Yes, I believe I was hasty. You may have one more chance to figure out who the murderer is before I take the suspects back to the Enclave.
You do not seem to have learned your lessons as well as I would have hoped. If you do not determine something more valid soon, I will be forced to return with the suspects to the Enclave.

Very well, I believe there may yet be a chance of you solving this. Where does the truth lie?
Heh heh... that's sort of funny, but you should really be serious about this, no?
Don't be absurd. Can't you be serious?
You should try to remain objective in this.
As far as I can determine, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke.
The dead man, Calder Nettic, was shot in the back with a blaster rifle. A rifle was found lying near his body with blood stains on it.
Two other men were found at the scene when I arrived. One was Handon Guld. He is unarmed. The other is Rickard Lusoff, who was carrying a hunting laser. I have confiscated the laser.
Both men say they did not do anything, and that they came across the body. But both also accuse the other. It is most perplexing.
When I arrived at the scene, Handon was holding his side and panting, and Rickard was favoring one of his legs.
I will tell you something to get you started on the case. According to the witness accounts, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke.
The dead man, Calder Nettic, was shot in the back with a blaster rifle. A rifle was found lying near his body with blood stains on it. It has been sent back to the Enclave for analysis.

Both men say they did not do anything, and that they came across the body. But both also accuse the other. Obviously there is more to this than what we have been told.
There is one last thing. When I arrived Handon was holding his side and Rickard was favoring one of his legs. You would do well to remember this as we progress through the case.
I cannot resolve this case.
I said I can't do it, dammit!
I cannot resolve this case.
I have reconsidered.
I will continue my investigation.
I want to discuss the murder.
They both were in on it.
They were both trying to kill him separately.
Rickard shot Handon after Handon killed Calder.
Because Handon's a whiny slime-ball.
I do not know.
He thought it was Calder.
Thanks, Teethree.
They were in it together, but Rickard doublecrossed Handon.
You attempts are pathetic!
You did try to kill him!
You shot Handon!
Get your fat head out of here.
I could let you go for... 100 credits?
You can go now.
Shut your mouth, you lying scum!
Of course I know what I've done.
What do you mean?
He was also having an affair with Handon's wife!
Just like?
I could let you go for... 100 credits?
Stay out of trouble from now on.
You can go now.
Shut your mouth you lying scum!
Of course I know what I've done.
What do you mean?
I knew it!
Just like you killed Calder!
Rickard did it.
He wanted to steal Calder's blaster.
Calder was secretly a Sith agent.
Calder was taking money from their business.
Handon did it.
Calder was cheating with his wife.
He had the opportunity and took it.
If you must.
[Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
[Persuade] I can still solve this!
He wanted to steal his blaster.
It's Rickard's blood.
He lied to me before.
He could have cut himself on the rocks.
He was limping earlier.
It's Handon's blood.
He is clutching his side.
The blood wasn't Calder's.
I don't trust him!
If you insist.
[Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
[Persuade] I can still solve this!
Let me try something else.
Rickard is lying.
He's lying to implicate Handon.
Rickard could have placed the blaster.
There was no one else who had a blaster.
Handon is lying.
He didn't have time to dump the blaster.
The blaster was not reported stolen.
He did not have a weapon on him.
If you insist.
[Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
[Persuade] I can still solve this!
Let me try something else.
Rickard is lying.
He's getting on my nerves.
He does not seem like a business man.
They had a fight over business matters.
Handon is lying.
He was probably stalking him.
He knew his wife was cheating on him.
If you insist.
[Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
[Persuade] I can still solve this!
Let me try something else.
He had rented a speeder with Calder.
Rickard is lying.
He must have shot Calder.
He would have seen Handon coming.
There is no iriaz here.
Handon is lying.
He is fat and out of shape.
He was stalking Calder.
If you insist.
[Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
[Persuade] I can still solve this!
Let me try something else.
Settlers had been told to carry weapons, but he didn't have one.
I do not know.
Rickard is lying.
He was being rude to me.
It was cloudy; there was no sun glare!
There are no iriaz for him to hunt here.
Handon is lying.
He was here at just the right time.
He didn't mention the weapon found by the body.
Fat people always lie.
If you insist.
[Force Persuade] You will let me try again.
[Persuade] I can still solve this!
I know who is lying now.
Tell me what happened here.
Apprentice, your arrival here is well timed.
Padawan, your arrival here is well timed.
I am Bolook, a Jedi from the Enclave. I was sent by the Jedi Council to investigate a killing that took place here a few hours ago.
I was going to handle this case myself, but now that you are here this could be an excellent opportunity for you to demonstrate how well you have been learning your lessons at the Academy.
Though you are not yet a full Jedi, perhaps you could assist me in sorting out the truth from the lies.
We Jedi are often called on to make judgements in case such as this. I think exploring this case could be an important part of your training, though I will not force you to participate.
If you are not willing to assist me, then I will bring the suspects to the Enclave and handle this myself. But are you certain you wish to pass up this opportunity to test yourself?
I find your demeanor most unbecoming in a prospective Jedi. I think that your mentors have perhaps been lax in your training.
I regret that you feel you cannot assist me. I will remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave for judgment. May the Force be with you.
I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, apprentice.
I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, Padawan.
Ah, that is good. Perhaps then, we can get to the bottom of this mystery.
According to the accounts of the participants, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke.
The dead man, Calder Nettic, was shot in the back with a blaster rifle. A rifle was found lying near his body with blood stains on it.
Two other men were found at the scene when I arrived. One was Handon Guld. He was unarmed. The other was Rickard Lusoff, who was carrying a hunting laser.
Both men say they did not do anything, and that they came across the body. But both also accuse the other. I will leave it to you to try and uravel these contradictions.
Listen to the stories given by the two suspects. I have brought an information retrieval droid with access to the archives both at the Jedi Enclave and the planetary capital.
I will use my wisdom and experience to offer you some guidance, but I will not solve the case for you. There is little benefit if you do not solve this problem yourself.
Consider each man's account and check the facts with the information droid. Once you have gathered all the evidence you think you need, run through the possible scenario with me.
If you are unable to come to a satisfactory resolution, then I will take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself.
What sort of assistance?
What do you want?
Who are you?
Sorry, I do not have time for this.
Get out of my way, worm-head!
I don't have the time to assist you.
I have reconsidered.
What happened?
What do you want me to do?
You may leave if you wish, but if you do I will have no choice but to tell the Jedi Council that you lacked the wisdom to solve this case.
Jarg went missing in Sector B, then Reeza saw someone moving south of there. Take a couple troops and find out who it is.
If they look suspicious: terminate.
How can I be of further assistance?
Of course, of course. Listen, if you need anything I shall be glad to assist.
In... injured? No, of course not! Why would I have been? Fit as a bantha! Har har! Yes... I run. I don't know if I mentioned that.
That blaster was stolen from my house last week! I never knew what happened to it.
I hardly have enough money to afford a single blaster, let alone another. I can't tell you how important it is to have a weapon on hand with all these ravenous kath hounds around.
Even an iriaz can take a man down if it gets in the mood. Every settler has a weapon. It's our most prized possession.
I would most appreciate it if I could have that back after you determine that Rickard is the killer.
That blaster? H... hey! That's my blaster!
Kill him? Well, I don't know maybe for being a liar and a cheat! I mean... well... *ahem* I guess I sort of incriminated myself there but...
Normally I am not prone to outbursts like that, but Calder... Mr. Nettic, he was not a very nice person. Not a very nice person to me or my family.
I had had my suspicions for several weeks, but had no proof until two days ago. It seems Calder was seeing my wife. Right under my nose, no less!
But I... I realize this must seem like a motive to you, but I assure you it isn't. I dislike Calder, true. I would punch his face in, given the opportunity. But I would not kill him!
I was just out running, trying to clear my head for the divorce proceedings, not stalking him to kill him. Running is not a crime.
Well, if you can't keep her, it's your own fault.
She may have had her reasons, Mandalorian!
I knew him a little bit, but I was not any sort of great friend to him or anything.
I never really associated with him that much. In truth, I didn't really want to. He had a... reputation. Very inconsiderate of family, I heard.
But merely having heard unkind things about someone wouldn't make me want to kill him!
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm getting a bit agitated. Why must we remain here? Can't... Can't you see that Rickard must have shot him?
I was taking my daily constitutional. I just happened to be running by when I heard a shot. I ran over and found Calder's body lying there.
Yes, quite often. I generally prefer running to anything else. Can't stand speeders.
A healthy body will breed a healthy mind, as I always say! Ha ha!
Actually, I didn't see anything. I was over across the bridge, I heard a shot and came over. I can tell you I was sure surprised to see Calder's body lying there!
I just got here when I saw Rickard coming out of the rocks, holding his blaster! I was terrified!
I had no idea what he was going to do so I hit my emergency button and called the Enclave.
Master Bolook came out here with his droid and started questioning us. I think he really doesn't understand what's going on.
I hope that you'll be able to make a more informed decision and get me out of here soon. I have things I have to do!
Ah, greetings. You must be assisting Master Bolook in his investigation.
I am Handon Guld, perhaps you've heard of me?
[Success] Really? *Ahem* Well, then, I assure you on my reputation I had nothing to do with the killing. I will help you with the case as best I can, though.
Um... I guess, under the circumstances, no.
Well, I presume you wish to hear my story then? I shall tell you, of course, but there is not much to it. I am sure that you'll agree that Rickard is quite obviously guilty of murder.
You see, I was out here running earlier today - yes, running, I do that a lot. Can't stand speeders, never use them. Keeps me in shape too, you know! Anyway, I was out running on the other side of that bridge there...
When all of a sudden I heard a shot coming from over here. I ran over and found this man Calder lying on the ground dead!
I saw Rickard come skulking out of the shadows of the rocks south of the river, and I knew something was wrong. I hit my emergency button and called the Enclave right away.
Now I bet you're wondering if I had any reasons to kill the man, but I tell you I hardly knew him! Saw him once or twice, yes, and I have heard some pretty unkind things about him, but...
Certainly nothing that would make me want to kill him!
Knock his block off, sure, but not kill him! Oh my... I hope you don't find that incriminating...
Um... well, you see, Calder was involved in some pretty sordid business from time to time. More often than not, I've heard.
Disreputable business practices, even more disreputable clients. I've even heard he had dealings with... a Hutt! A Hutt here on Dantooine!
He also had a reputation as a womanizer... Married women.
My wife was cheating on me with him. They slept in my own bed while I was in the next room!
But... as much as I may hate him for that, I could not kill him.
It may have been my own fault for driving my wife away. I must try not to take the law in my own hands.
Well... there, that's my story. Now please hurry this up and arrest Rickard so I can get on with my day!
Nothing more right now.
You're holding your side. Are you injured?
What do you know about the weapon found by the body?
Why would someone want to kill him?
Did you know the victim?
No one says you killed him... yet.
Why were you out here?
Do you often run around the plains?
What did you see happen?
[Lie] Ah, yes of course, Mr. Guld.
Should I have?
No.
Go on.
Did you see the killer?
What did he do to you?
You wanted to harm him?
He stole your girlfriend? Wife?
Let me guess...
Is there any other information you need?
Very well. I will be here to assist you.
The blood on the weapon is definitely not Calder's. Unfortunately there was a bacterial contaminant in the sample that had been taken back to the laboratory, and it had become degraded.
We cannot get any more specific analysis from that sample other than the fact it did not belong to Calder.
I am sorry, but I seem to be failing you. I have searched and searched, but I cannot seem to come up with anything at all.
I thought to find the record of the missing weapon report Mr. Guld filed with the authorities, but there does not seem to be one.
These plains are rife with wild animals, not all of them benign. The iriaz are mostly docile, but can easily be provoked to violence. Kath hounds, on the other hand, are much more deadly...
There have been over 35 catalogued attacks on settlers by kath hounds in the last 2 weeks. A general advisory was given out three days ago to carry a weapon at all times when on the plains.
Small farms and holdings dot the plains, and can provide safe refuge for those in need.
According to the municipal authorities near the Garang spaceport, there had been news of violent drunken activity in a cantina attached to the port.
Apparently a Mr. R. Lusoff was making accusations at a Mr. C. Nettic about cheating him in a business deal. Jedi Tooka was dispatched to the scene and restored order.
The Southwood speeder rental business has records that, over the past several weeks, a speeder had been rented by Mr. Nettic and Mr. Guld.
My preliminary analysis of the body indicates that he was killed approximately 3 hours ago by a single energy blast to the torso.
I have just received back an analysis of a sample of the blood found on the weapon. It had been sent back to the Enclave just before you arrived.
The blood on the weapon is definitely not Calder's. Unfortunately there was a bacterial contaminant in the sample that had been taken back to the laboratory, and it had become degraded.
We cannot get any more specific analysis from that sample other than the fact it did not belong to Calder.
I know that I am supposed to be restricted to information gathering purposes only, but I feel that I should make an observation.
You arrived on the scene of the murder late, so would not have seen how the suspects looked at that time.
When I arrived, Handon seemed to be moving awkwardly, and he has hardly moved at all since you arrived. I do not know what exactly it would mean though.
Greetings, apprentice. You must be the one Master Bolook has enlisted to help him with this problem.
I am an information retrieval droid. I can assist you by accessing the records of both the Jedi Enclave and the central government facilities here on Dantooine.
If you have any need of my services, please do not hesitate to talk to me.
I have already retrieved some information from the archives on Calder Nettic, Rickard Lusoff and Handon Guld. I have also had time to examine the body of Mr. Nettic.
Is there any information you require?
Greetings, Padawan. You must be the one Master Bolook has enlisted to help him with this problem.
I will have more questions later.
Tell me about the blood sample.
Is there a report of Handon's blaster being stolen?
Tell me about these plains.
What can you tell me about Calder and Rickard?
What can you tell me about Calder and Handon?
What did you find out about the body?
*sigh* What is it you want? Why do you bother me?
Flee back to your masters, Jedi.
I have fallen and dark power courses through my veins. I can never go back to the Council, so here I shall stay.
Talk?! You who have beaten me so easily just want to talk? I do not believe it. Kill me now, while you still have the power.
The Council has sent you here to kill me? Why, then, when you bested me so easily, did you not simply finish your task? Is it not apparent that I can never be saved?
Thinking of using technicalities to do the deed and ease your conscience?
Act or begone!
Not anger, peace... Yet even with your naive attitude you managed to beat me.
[Failure] Lies! Leave me and come back when you have the courage to finish your task!
[Failure] Lies! Leave me and come back when you are man enough to carry out your task!
[Success] You... you do not?
I am pathetic. I sit here and think myself to be great by embracing the dark side, but I am nothing! There is no way I could be turned back!
I always thought they held me back, were jealous of my power. But it is only because I was not good enough to meet their standards... I never have been.
What?? What foolishness is this? Standards are MADE to apply to everyone.
And if I cannot measure up to them... Well then, I am no one at all...
Leave me.
They came to me! They sought me out! So it is their failure that I have fallen.
Come back when you have something more meaningful to say.
Why? Because I am right, that's why! I can see the truth in your eyes as well!
Do not look at me again!
[Failure] You think compliments will convince me I didn't kill my master? Leave me to my agony!
[Success] I thank you for your kind words, Jedi.
I seem to still have much to learn... Both about being a Jedi, and about myself.
But I wish the cost of my ignorance had not been so high. I wish that my Master had not suffered because of me.
What? No! I will not let you take me now!
Life is suffering, yes... but it was by my conscious choice!
It was I who hurt her, I who killed her! Her suffering is my fault alone!
Leave me to my pain!
She knew I would be headstrong, but she also thought I would adhere to the light!
Instead, I betrayed her trust and fell prey to my own inner darkness.
But learning does not have to end in death!
[Failure] It is! It is!
[Success] I only wish things could have been different...
If she were alive now, there would be so much I would say to her... So much I would apologize for.
Oh, how can the Council ever take me back with what I have done? Striking my Master down in anger is unforgivable!
And denied! No, I cannot! And so here I will stay.
You... You monster! To mock my grief that way!
Leave me at once, lest I strike you down!
The Council may forgive a lot... But not this.
I am lost! Even though I would repent, there is nowhere left for me to go!
Leave me to my hopelessness!
If I show them I am free of passion... That I am serene... That I am willing to forsake the dark side.
[Failure] The Council may forgive a lot... But not this.
[Success] I should convince them that I am truly repentant, that I am willing to forsake the dark side.
Maybe, just maybe, they would accept me back.
Do you think they would? Could it be possible after what I have done?
I... I thank you, master Jedi.
[Success] I... I thank you, master Jedi.
I will return to the Council, then. I shall submit myself to their judgment, and hope that they will forgive me.
Again, I thank you. I am sure I will hear great things about you in the future.
If only there was some way I could make this up to you...
I think, in my own way, I truly loved her...
You seem to know just what affects me...
How can I ever face the Council now with what I have done? It is hopeless! It could not be possible that they would accept me back...
I do not know what to do. Now that I have caused such suffering to my Master and those around me...
You... you are strong. Stronger than me, even in my darkness.
I, Juhani, shall be your death!
I am Juhani, and this is my grove. This is the place of my dark power.
This is the place you have invaded. When I embraced the dark side, this was where I sought my solace. It is MINE!
Yes... Aren't they pretty? My pets...
They like the smell of power I exude. They know their master.
I harnessed true power when I struck down my Master, Quatra.
A better Jedi than you will ever be. More powerful as well, for I could best MY teacher.
When I slew my Master, Quatra, I knew I could never go back. And now I revel in my dark power.
Power enough to crush the life from someone such as you... or so I had thought...
You overestimate yourself, whelp!
Yes, I struck her down in the middle of training, consumed by my anger, embracing the power of hate!
But... it was not enough...
I will leave you now.
I have decided to slay you and remove the taint.
Why are you doing this?
I just want to talk.
I was sent by the Council to cleanse the taint from this grove.
I wasn't really ordered to kill you.
I do not hold anger towards you, Juhani. I wish you peace.
You're right, maybe I should.
[Persuade] I have no desire to kill you, Juhani.
The first step on the path of true knowledge is knowing that you are ignorant.
Standards cannot apply to everyone.
Maybe you shouldn't have been a Jedi, then.
Why are you even thinking like that?
[Persuade] Come now, Juhani. You are a beautiful young woman who has much talent.
I suppose there is no hope. I must kill you then.
Life is suffering.
Your master knew the risks.
Life is a learning experience.
Even in death, the Force will allow her to live on.
[Persuade] It is not your fault, Juhani.
Yet forgiveness must be asked.
Heh. Your Master surely won't be forgiving you.
The Council may forgive a lot.
Anger? Show them that you have freed yourself of this base passion.
[Persuade] Do not worry, Juhani. They will surely take you back.
If you can't bring yourself back, then I must slay you.
I do not know.
Your inner peace and harmony will show them your sincerity.
Unlikely... But it's worth a shot.
It might be.
[Persuade] Of course it would. They would always accept you back.
And I'll finish you now.
Why did you attack me?
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
And now I'll take it from you.
You've been corrupting the kath hounds?
You were a Jedi then?
You embraced the dark side? Why?
You shall be the one I crush!
You slew Quatra, your Master?
And I laugh at your pathetic attempt.
The dark side is never powerful enough.
So what do you want to know?
Right...
Well... uh... I kind of sprained my ankle running through the bush before I found the body. But it's nothing that serious.
That blaster? Never seen it before. Calder himself had a preference for Echani weaponry. He had this one really nice light blaster rifle that he always used.
Always wished I could get myself a rifle like the one he had...
That blaster ain't it, though. Calder only had the one rifle, too, so he either must have borrowed that... or it's someone else's.
Looks kinda cheap too. Like it was bought by someone who didn't really know his blasters that well. And Calder knew his weapons, for sure.
Echanis make delicate weapons with too little firepower. Lightweight stuff, if you ask me.
I don't understand why anyone would want to kill him at all. Certainly not why I would want to, if that's what you're trying to get at!
You Jedi are so predictable. Always seeing some greater purpose behind everything, when the simple answer is usually the right one.
Can't you see that it must have been Handon? I found him standing over the damned body!
Yes, Handon had a motive you have missed: Calder was fooling around with his wife. I have known this all along, but I was hoping you would discover this vital information during your investigations and realize the importance of it yourself.
I don't know why this is causing you so much trouble. You almost seem as lost as this Bolook guy.
Yeah, I knew him. Hell, we've known each other for a good long time. Doesn't mean I really have to have liked the slime-ball.
*sigh* Maybe I shouldn't be so hard on him... especially now that he's dead. We actually got along pretty well most of the time. We just had our... differences.
We were actually business partners. We were involved in some orbit-to-ground transport operations for Aratech.
Can I leave now? I should probably be the one to give the news to his wife.
I told ya already, didn't I? Was hunting some iriaz. Haven't seen many in the area recently, what with those kath hounds acting up, but they're still around.
Was in my blind a little south of here when I spotted one, like I said before. I shot and POW!, it went down. But when I come over here, there's Handon standing over the body and the iriaz was gone!
Now, I didn't have nothing to do with this, so can I go now?
*grumbles*
Well, I was out hunting iriaz south of here, and I saw one over by the bridge. The sun was pretty much right behind it though, so I couldn't see it none too clearly.
I shot, and when I came over here I found Handon standing over the body, holding his side. There wasn't an iriaz in sight... I think he might have taken it!
Calder must've been hunting it himself 'cause there was a rifle lying close to the body. Bolook's got that now... mine, too. I want that back!
Another Jedi, eh? Helping that Twi'lek investigate, no doubt. He seems stumped.
I'm Rickard Lusoff. Maybe you can figure this out and let me get out of here.
Well, I was out hunting iriaz, when I spotted one over here by the bridge. I pull out my rifle and aim at it. I couldn't see it that well, mind you, cause the damn sun was in my eyes.
So I shoot it and it drops. I walk over here and find Handon standing over Calder's body!
Now, I don't love Calder, but we go back a long way. We run a sub-orbital shipping and transport company out of Garang spaceport.
We've been partners in that business for well over twenty years, and we've been doing just fine the way we are.
So why don't you get this whole farce over with and send that whiner Handon to the prison he belongs in!
Nothing more right now.
Bolook said you were limping. Are you hurt?
What about the weapon found by the body?
Why would someone want to kill him?
Did you know the victim?
Why were you out here?
Not just yet.
What did you see happen?
Tell me what happened.
Ah, so this is the meddler. You have caused us far too much trouble for a mere Jedi.
I will add your head to those of the other Jedi I have killed, and take yet another lightsaber for my own! Now you will know why the Mandalorians are feared!
Now this is what I've been waiting for!

Dantooine - Sandral Grounds
Thank you for saving me, master Jedi. I am C8-42, a personal assistance droid.
Ah, yes, I apologize, for my incorrect terminology.
That was not that bad... compared to what I had to endure back at my owner's.
Yes, I am owned by Elise Montagne, a wealthy widow who lives north of here.
That would be one way of putting it.
I'm afraid my owner became a bit too attached to me. Obsessed even.
She... she tried to treat me as her dead husband. It was not healthy for her.
You don't want to know...
She is obsessed. She rarely sees other people, and appears to be fixated on me as her husband.
She was becoming more and more insular... I thought it best that I leave. She may meet other real people this way.
In fact, that was the reason I came here and sought out those kath hounds.
I think it would be best if I were no longer a factor. She would meet new people. Living people.
Please... will you destroy me?
Wh... what?
No! You'd make her suffer like that?! You monster!
Do not do this...
But... but why?
You... you will help me? Help her, I mean, to live as a normal human should?
Thank you, thank you, kind Jedi! I shall return to her now and await your assistance.
I realize that you have much on your mind, and it may be days or weeks before you can help us, but I shall serve my mistress well until you come.
You seem determined. And I have very little choice.
So be it then. I shall return to her.
Yes... Yes I am. It seems I must resign myself to my fate.
To be a droid. A second-class being with no rights at all.
You... you're right... How could I be so selfish?
I must not think only of myself, but of how it affects her.
She must be frantic. And if she lost me she'd be devastated.
I must return then. It is my duty.
Thank you, kind sir! You have my eternal gratitude.
Who knows. They are beasts, and have been very aggressive of late.
As I said, I am C8-42, a personal assistance droid. Although in recent months the assistance I render seems to have taken on a disproportionate significance.
I am sorry if I seem a bit abrupt, but I must be moving along. I am rather in a hurry.
From my master, Elise. Wait...
Not so much as where I am going to, but where I am going away from...
Did she send you to find me? Please do not tell her you saw me!
No... I ran away of my own free will. But I have my reasons!
Yes... But I have my reasons!
No problem.
I am not a Jedi Master yet.
That was quite a beating you took.
You left your owner's?
Owner's?
They abused you?
But she wants you back.
Er... ALL the time?
Um... probably not...
Is she crazy?
You want to get away that badly?
What, are you suicidal or something?
I'll destroy you and tell her you're still out there.
No. You should go back to her.
Return for now, and I'll help you later.
Because if you don't, I'll carry you back myself.
You're her property, and must obey her.
She is lonely and needs your support.
Fine. I'll destroy you and tell her why you did it.
You sought them out?
Why were kath hounds attacking you?
Personal assistance droid?
Okaay...
Are you running from something?
Where are you going to?
Huh?
Are you Elise's droid?
Weren't you kidnapped?
You're running from her?
I... I don't know why we fight like this. We got along in the beginning, didn't we Ahlan?
I don't know how you can think of that when we have our children trying to go away together.
Well, it wouldn't be so bad would it? Shen seems to genuinely care for my Rahasia. He might be a good husband for her someday.
Hmph. As much as I may dislike it... I think I see it too.
I suppose... I suppose I might be convinced to see that Sandral girl with my son. IF she is loyal to him.
But I don't trust you a centimeter farther, old man. Your daughter may treat Shen well, but you will never see them! They will live with me.
Of course not, you pompous old windbag! They'll be living with me!
Of course not! My house is more than good enough!
I will not have them set foot in a Sandral household!
They shall not live with the Matales!
Then you propose to buy us a new house, do you?
Um... well, yes, actually that sounds like a good idea.
I'm... surprised. That does sound like a good idea!
We should discuss this more...
Thank you, Master Jedi, for bringing us together and getting our parents to accept us.
We will praise you to the Council for what you have done and name our children after you.
Thank you again. We will remember you always.
I don't care! Rahasia and I will live on our own if you won't accept us!
You will do no such thing! I am your father and I order you to come back with me!
No, father, I won't!
Rahasia! You will not leave with this... this Matale boy!
I am, father, and you can't stop me! We're leaving for the Enclave!
You foolish girl!
You think to make us stand here, then?!
You expect us to just let them leave?? Droids! Stop them!
You will not turn your droids on my daughter! Droids! Don't let them take Rahasia!
We appear to be at an impasse then... And they got away!
It is your fault, Ahlan! You were always too violent for your own good!
ME?! You were the one who rushed out here with war droids!
Do not tell me what to do, Jedi! The Council will hear of the trouble you caused here today!
I will not rest until I have my Shen back! The Council will hear of the troubles you caused, Jedi!
Indeed they shall!
I suppose I should have seen it from the beginning... that our hopeless romance would be doomed to failure.
Please Shen, it doesn't have to end this way!
Yes it does, it would never work. Our families are too different.
Shen! No!
Shen, wait! I love you!
Don't say that to me, Rahasia. Let's try to stay calm... rational.
We both know it wouldn't work. Let's not get all emotional and end up hating each other.
I... I see. I wonder how I could ever have thought differently about you, Rahasia. How I could have been so blind.
Shen, no...
I was foolish, my father was right, we are not destined for one another. It would never have worked. There would have been too many problems. Sometimes it is just better to let things die.
Shen, wait! I love you!
I'm sorry, Rahasia. It just won't work. In fact... I don't think I like you very much at all. You remind me too much of your father.
Yes, and I thank you for showing me what I had to do.
I'm ready to leave now, father.
Let's go home then.
Here is you reward, Jedi, for your assistance.
This isn't over Sandrals! I will take this affront directly before the Jedi Council and see you exiled from this world!
Shen... No...
Come inside, Rahasia. Let's get the stink of that Matale dog off you.
Father, no! Don't do it!
Die!
Shen!
Die!
Die!
No! Rahasia! I'll kill you!
The Master has been injured. Terminate all opposition.
Destroy the invaders!
Why should I listen to the Jedi? All you want is to remain with that Sandral harlot.
My daughter is not a harlot, Matale dog!
Our children don't know enough of what's good for them to make a reasonable decision!
It's better to let older, wiser heads like ours make the decisions.
Rahasia and I don't want you to make decisions for us! We want to live alone away from you!
You... You insolent boy! If you want to live alone then so be it! I disown you! Never set foot in my house again!
We are trying to be reasonable here, of course. We ARE sensible people after all. But our children are being so stubborn.
If Shen would just understand that he has to do what I want, this would all be solved easily.
I have every right! Shen is my son!
You know what you're getting yourself into here Shen? Is causing a war between our families what you really want to do?
No... but I want Rahasia!
You can't have her! I will fight to keep her from you!
Listen to the Jedi, for once, Shen. Don't turn this into a war.
[Failure] No! I won't let you do this!
[Success] But he is my son... I don't want to lose him...
And I won't let my daughter go with him!
Yes! Because Ahlan has caused nothing but trouble for us ever since we arrived on this world! His hate poisons this place.
That's enough, Sandral scum! Come, Shen, we're leaving now. If you don't... the consequences will be dire.
[Failure] Not with a Matale she won't!
Enough of this babble! Come, Shen, we're leaving. If you don't... the consequences will be dire.
[Success] My little Rahasia...
Father...
This in an internal affair for my family and is none of your concern!
You should not interfere with our private business, Jedi. This will be resolved very shortly.
My son doesn't know his head from his backside! I am the only one qualified to be making his decisions for him, and I say that he leave with me right now!
This is a private affair, Jedi. You would do well not to interfere. We are allowed to decide the fate of our children!
No, I won't! I can choose my own path!
Shen! How dare you!
I am tired of you controlling my life! I love Rahasia and I want to be with her forever!
And I want to stay with Shen forever, father!
Don't disobey me, Shen. Come to me now and leave her! If you don't I'll disown you!
You don't know what you're getting into, Shen. Do you want to start a war here?
I will never let Rahasia leave me!
Do not trust that Sandral girl, Shen! She is treacherous like her father and will only betray you!
No, Shen, don't believe him!
But...
Get away from my daughter Matale!
It's gone too far for that, Rahasia. Ahlan has crossed the line one too many times!
Ha! For what you've done to me and my family, I will see you dead and rotting in the ground
No! Don't!
This... this has all gone horribly wrong somewhere. Ahlan, what can we be thinking? How could we have let this go this far?
We are at each others throats now fighting over our children's lives when they are old enough to live their own.
He is my son! How can he disrespect my wishes like this?
My son doesn't know enough to act responsibly on his own!
My son will do what I tell him!
I have my own life, father, and I want to spend it with Rahasia!
You're too immature to do anything on your own.
I can do whatever I want! You can't control me!
[Failure] No, I don't believe you! Rahasia and I love each other!
[Success] What? No! Rahasia, how...how could you? How could you lead me to believe... ?
No, Shen, I...
Come away from that Sandral harlot, Shen. Come back with me.
I... I...
[Success] No, I...
Look at her! See what kind of person she really is!
I... I could try couldn't I? I would...
You know nothing of what it would be like with that... that Sandral!
[Success] He... WHAT??
No, no! I never did anything to your son, I...
I knew you were lying, you dog! And to think I thought it might not have been you! So I'll take your son from you!
I see little choice in the matter with the Matale dog invading my estate like this, and his son stealing my daughter.
You stole my son first! Whatever the Jedi might say, I know it was you!
My son will never be with your daughter while I'm alive!
Rahasia and I love each other and we'll be together forever!
[Failure] No! Rahasia would never do that!
She's a Sandral, boy! They're no good for anything!
You lying Matale dog! My Rahasia is twice the man your son will ever be!
Why... Why all of this? Why are you fighting?
I will never let you live with a Sandral, Shen. Come back to me now.
Come back to me, boy. You know this is the way things will be.
There you are Shen!
Father!
Mr. Matale!
Rahasia!
Father!
Mr. Sandral!
Nurik!
Ahlan!
I knew this was all your doing! I knew you had captured my son!
I thought you had taken my Casus from me! I thought I was justified!
You had taken my Casus from me long before that! You started it!
I don't want to hear any of your excuses! Now I will get revenge for your transgressions!
No! Father don't do this!
We don't always need to be fighting like this!
We never asked for you help, Jedi! Do not press in matters that do not concern you!
Please listen to her, father!
Please listen to him, father!
Shen! You're safe!
Rahasia! Thank goodness you managed to escape!
It was all thanks to this kind Jedi that we managed to get this far at all. I thank you Jedi, for all that you have done for us.
You're right, we should go as fast as we can. I don't know how long it will be before my father realizes we're gone.
You're right, we should...
What? You're... you're just doing this for the reward?
How could you! I thought you...
No, we know that you must have gone to great personal risk to get us out of the Sandral estate undetected.
Is there something - anything - we can offer you as a reward?
Very well, we'll see what we...
Why... thank you. You're quite the looker yourself. I think maybe we can...
Shen!
No, no! I just...
Why... thank you. You're quite the looker yourself. I think maybe we can...
Rahasia!
No, no! I just...
But surely we can...
I knew you two could see reason.
You'll let them stay together?
They could stay at the Jedi Enclave.
They can live with both of you.
Why don't you compromise?
Let them go.
Do not be so selfish, Nurik.
Do not try to force them to return.
SHUT UP!
You don't need to fight anymore.
Both of you calm down.
This is for the best.
There's nothing you can do Rahasia.
Let him go Rahasia.
You should leave with your father now.
Sometimes you have to make hard decisions.
You've made the right choice, Shen.
Run, Rahasia, run!
Don't do it, Ahlan!
Stop this madness now!
Why don't you try listening to your children?
Will you go with Shen, Rahasia?
Shen...
You should try to sort this out together.
Both of you calm down now!
You've no right to keep them apart!
Don't do something rash.
Let it go, Shen.
[Persuade] Shen is capable of making decisions on his own.
Because you hate the Matales?
[Persuade] Children grow up and leave eventually.
Your children should be allowed to live their own lives.
Do not do anything outside the law.
You two should stay together no matter what.
You may want to reconsider this.
I don't know if you can trust Rahasia, Shen.
Don't give up on her, Shen.
Turn away, Shen.
The only way either of you will end this is with blood.
You can't control your children forever.
Your son has his own life, Ahlan.
[Lie] Rahasia doesn't love you anyway.
[Persuade] You want to trust yourself to a woman who would betray her own father?
Rahasia would only betray you in the end.
You can see Rahasia isn't right for you.
You could never make Rahasia happy anyway.
Your father is right, Shen. Leave Rahasia.
[Lie] You know, Nurik, Ahlan actually did kill Casus.
If you fight, you'll all be killed.
Do not act too hastily. This does not have to end badly.
[Lie] You know she was just using you.
Your families will never get along, Shen.
Let her go, Shen. It's the easiest way to mend things.
It will never work, Shen. Why lose your family as well?
Why don't you just shoot each other and get it over with.
Don't make me intervene in this.
You two just need to calm down.
We should get out of here quickly.
Shen's father promised me a reward.
It was no problem.
Money always helps.
Well... You're a very attractive young man, Shen...
Well... You're a very attractive girl, Rahasia...
No reward is necessary.
Tandore, the damn farmers in Sector E aren't giving up their stuff. We're going to go pay them a visit and crush the spirit out of them. Make sure no one runs across this stash, or Sherruk will have your hide!
Nurik left orders he was not to be disturbed, but given the circumstances I will make an exception. Go into the main hall. Nurik will meet with you there.
This is private property! By what authority are you trespassing on this estate?
Casus is dead? Then it is as we feared. You should speak to Nurik yourself. He will want to question you on the details of his son's death.
I am not programmed for battle, but I will not open the gates except for those on official family business.
Even if you destroy me, you will not be able to get in. And tomorrow, another droid will be programmed to take over my duties.
My orders are clear. Please leave immediately. Only those on official family business are permitted on the family's land.
The Council? If you are here because of Shen Matale's disappearance you are wasting your time. The Sandrals are not involved. This is nothing but a Matale witch hunt.
Very well. We wish no trouble with the Jedi Council.
Nurik has nothing more to say to you. He left strict instructions he was not to be disturbed under any circumstances.
You may give the diary to me. Nurik wanted you to have these credits - they are a reward for recovering his son's diary. But he himself is too upset over the fate of Casus to receive visitors.
Casus is dead? Then it is as we feared. I will be sure Nurik is given this news, though it will break his heart. But even under these circumstances I cannot let you in.
Casus Sandral is dead.
My weapons are my authority!
I'm sorry, I'll be going now.
I come on behalf of the Jedi Council.
In the name of the Council, I demand you let me in!
I am not in league with the Matales, but I must speak to Nurik.
I have his son's diary. Nurik asked me to bring it to him.
Casus Sandral is dead.
I'm getting inside, and nothing you can do will stop me!
My investigation is not yet complete.

You are neither Builder nor slave. If you seek the secrets of the Star Forge you must first prove yourself worthy. Only then will the sealed door behind be opened.
I shall remain here as programmed by the Builders.
The chambers on either side contain the proving grounds. Within them, those who understand the will of the Builders can unlock their secrets and open the doors.
But those who fail will be destroyed by the security systems of the temple itself. More than this, I am not programmed to say.
I am here to aid those who seek the knowledge of the Builders. What do you wish to know?
The Star Forge is the glory of the Builders, the apex of their infinite empire. It is a machine of invincible might, a tool of unstoppable conquest.
The Builders are the great masters of the galaxy, the conquerors of all worlds, the rulers of the infinite empire and the creators of the Star Forge.
More than this, I am not programmed to say.
I am the Overseer. The Builders programmed me to enforce discipline among the slaves while this monument to the power of the Star Forge was constructed.
At project completion all slaves were executed. I was reprogrammed to serve should a Builder return in search of knowledge of the Star Forge.
[This droid is speaking a language you do not recognize.]
[This droid is speaking a language you do not recognize.]
I think the droid is trying to communicate with us by cycling through a variety of languages. Each time it spoke it was using a very different alien dialect.
The droid can probably understand us. The only problem is it may not have been programmed with the phonemes of a language we can understand.
I can reproduce any of the languages spoken by the slaves of the Builders.
I recognize this language as well. It is an archaic variant of the Selkath dialect spoken on Manaan. But why would a droid on Dantooine be programmed to speak ancient Selkath?
Communication was vital to ensure that the slaves constructed this temple according to the wishes of the Builders.
But you are not of the slave species. Neither are you of the Builders. You are like the one who came before.
It must be referring to Revan. The Dark Lord and Malak likely encountered this droid when they explored these ruins.
I am the Overseer. The Builders programmed me to enforce discipline among the slaves while this monument to the power of the Star Forge was constructed.
At project completion all slaves were executed. I was reprogrammed to serve should a Builder return in search of knowledge of the Star Forge.
The Star Forge is the glory of the Builders, the apex of their infinite empire. It is a machine of invincible might, a tool of unstoppable conquest.
The... the Star Forge is the glory of the Builders, the apex of their infinite empire. It is a machine of invincible might, a tool of unstoppable conquest.
The droid is obviously not programmed with the knowledge we seek. The Star Forge sounds like some type of weapon, perhaps... though, in fact, it could be anything
Our vision was clear. We saw Revan and Malak speaking of the Star Forge. I am certain it is somehow connected to the Sith's sudden rise to power.
Maybe... that might explain how the Sith were able to amass a fleet so quickly. But I suspect the Star Forge is more powerful than a mere factory.
Maybe the droid has more information we can use. It seems to respond to you; perhaps you should ask it something else.
The Builders are the great masters of the galaxy, the conquerors of all worlds, the rulers of the infinite empire and the creators of the Star Forge.
These Builders must have been an extinct people, though it is strange there is no record of their existence. Even the archives at the Jedi Academy make no mention of them.
In the years before the Republic the Hutts were a dominant force in the galaxy, but they never constructed an empire. In fact, I know of no species that would fit with this information.
I know nothing of these "Sith", but they are not the Builders. The Builders are... the Builders.
The empire of the Builders is infinite and everlasting. None can stand against their might and the power of the Star Forge.
I have been here ever since the completion of this monument. In all this time no Builder has returned to seek information on the Star Forge.
The Selkath were nothing but slaves and servants of the true masters. Like all the other species, they bowed down before the might of the Builders and the Star Forge.
My chronological circuits have marked over ten full revolutions of this system's outermost planet around the sun since the Builders left.
Ten revolutions would take more than 20,000 years. If this is true then this droid is nearly 5,000 years older than the Republic itself! There must be some mistake.
There is no mistake. The Builders constructed my chronological circuitry using the technology of the Star Forge itself. My calculations are infallible.
Now that the slaves are gone, my purpose is to aid those who seek knowledge of the Star Forge... if they are worthy.
The ones who came before you - the ones like you, not Builders but not slaves - sought knowledge of the Star Forge and its origins. They proved themselves worthy.
They discovered the secrets of the Star Forge locked beyond the sealed door behind me. But there was another who failed to unlock the secrets and paid the ultimate price.
The droid must be talking about poor Nemo. The Council sent him here to investigate... and it cost him his life.
Enter the proving grounds to the east and west. Within them those who understand the will of the Builders can unlock their secrets and open the doors.
But those who fail will be destroyed by the power of the temple itself. More than this, I am not programmed to say.
Revan and Malak unlocked the sealed door and uncovered the secrets of the Star Forge. Now Malak is using the Star Forge to fuel his conquest of the Republic.
We have to find out what they uncovered. We have to find a way to unseal these doors to learn more about the Star Forge! The Republic is depending on us.
I am not programmed for combat, I did not harm the one who failed. This temple's own protections will destroy those who seek knowledge of the Star Forge if they are deemed unworthy.
I'll be going now.
How do I prove myself worthy and unseal the doors?
I want to ask you some questions.
Tell me about the Star Forge.
What do you know about the Builders?
Who are you again?
I don't understand you.
What language is that? What are you trying to say?
This is pointless. Let's go.
This droid must be broken.
Bastila, do you have any idea what this droid is saying?
I still don't understand you.
I recognize this language.
Hey! I understood that.
Are you some type of guardian?
What are you? Why are you here?
What is the 'Star Forge'?
You don't really know what it is, do you?
Could you be a little more specific?
But what is it? What does it do?
Maybe it has nothing to do with the Sith.
Could it have been a factory or weapons plant?
Who are these Builders you keep talking about?
Maybe the Builders refers to the Sith.
Something must have happened to wipe the Builders out.
Have you seen a Builder recently?
The droid speaks Selkath. Maybe they were the Builders.
How long have you been here?
Tell me about Revan and Malak... the ones who came before us.
Where can we find the Star Forge?
What is your purpose here again?
How can I open the sealed doors behind you?
How can I prove myself worthy?
Did you kill the Jedi over there?
This... this must be what Revan and Malak found when they entered this temple. This must be where their journey down the dark side began.
This is a... a map. Some sort of intergalactic navigational chart. Revan and Malak must have used this to lead them to the Star Forge.
We could use this map to follow their path and find the Star Forge ourselves. But we must be wary... they may have laid traps or concealed what they found.
I... I don't know, but Revan and Malak were very interested in finding it. It must be a tool of some type... or maybe a weapon. Perhaps the Council can tell us more.
But I think this map might be the key to finding the Star Forge, whatever it is.
See this world here? This looks like Korriban, a Sith world. And if that's Korriban, then this is... Kashyyyk... and Tatooine... and here's Manaan.
But there are pieces missing: incomplete hyperspace coordinates, corrupted data... and there doesn't seem to be anything indicating where the Star Forge itself might be.
I was thinking that, too. This map can't take us to the Star Forge, but I know that Revan and Malak visited Korriban at least once. Perhaps they discovered something more there.
They may have found something on each of the other worlds that completed this map. Maybe if we find all the pieces they will lead us to the Star Forge... and some way to destroy it.
We must inform the Council of what we have discovered. They must decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.
That sounds like quite a supposition. What if you're wrong?
What if I'm right? We can't ignore this. Finding the Star Forge might very well be the key to defeating the Sith!
If the droid is correct, then we must complete the tasks in the proving grounds to the east and west before these doors will open.
I don't get it. Is this the Star Forge?
What are you talking about?
What is it?
I still don't understand about the Star Forge. What does it do?
What good is an incomplete map?
Perhaps those worlds have more clues.
So what is the Star Forge, exactly?
The ancient computer stands silent and still.

Sandral Estate
I have been informed by my protocol droid that you have news about my son Casus.
I have been informed by my protocol droid that you wish to speak to me.
Casus... is dead? I was afraid of this, yet in my heart I knew it must be true. What... what happened to my son?
Are all Jedi so callous towards those who grieve? No matter. Your cruel words hurt me no more than the news itself.
Kath hounds? I... I was so certain the Matale family was to blame... But this changes nothing! My own son is dead - why should I shed one tear about the disappearance of my bitter enemy's son?
I must ask you something, though it is difficult for me. My son had a diary. His private, personal thoughts. Now that he is gone, I have nothing else to remember him by.
Please, the diary means more to me than it ever could to you. I will give you a hundred credits for its return.
I thank you for this. The diary is all I have left of my son.
We have nothing further to discuss. Please, leave me to my grief.
[Failure] You think you can exploit a father's grief? I loved my son, but I am no fool! You shall get nothing from me! May the curse that brought Casus to his death be on your head as well!
Your actions show you are overly focused on material wealth. This is not the way of the Jedi. You will have to learn to let go of your greed if you wish to walk in the light.
[Success] I did not realize the Jedi were such cold hearted monsters. Very well, you shall have your two hundred credits. Here!
Typical. Anything to continue the feud which has become so customary to you people.
I know nothing about Shen! Please, just tell me what you know about my son!
I feel great sorrow at the young Matale heir's disappearance, but they are not the only family to suffer such a tragedy. Dantooine is a dangerous place.
My own son Casus has been missing for some time now. But I know nothing about the disappearance of Shen. Perhaps he and Casus now share a similar fate.
I brought my family here to find peace and safety - not to be harassed and treated like common criminals! Your Council has no authority here, and I respectfully ask you to leave this property at once.
I trust you will show yourself out. If not, my security droids will be sure to deal with you.
I've seen an evasion or two in my time... enough to know when I hear it.
Jedi are renowned for their fairness and pursuit of justice. There is nothing to fear from us... unless you have something to hide.
That's quite a line. You actually believe that? Don't you think someone is allowed to value privacy?
Privacy is all well and good, but justice must be valued higher. Is it not obvious to you that this man hides something?
Actually, it is. All I'm saying is that not everybody welcomes the sight of a Jedi with open arms. Better get used to it.
This guy isn't telling us something... he might even be lying. I don't trust him.
For once I will have to agree with the Mandalorian...
Your son Casus is dead. I have seen his body.
Casus is a kath hound chew toy.
He was killed by kath hounds while exploring the Dantooine ruins.
I shall go and find the diary for you, Nurik.
I shall go and find the diary for you, Nurik. But I need no reward for this
[Persuade] Make it two hundred and you have a deal.
Here is the diary.
Here is the diary, Nurik, but you may keep your money. I need no reward for this task.
I am here on behalf of the Jedi Council. I am investigating the disappearance of Shen Matale.
I want to ask you about the disappearance of Shen Matale.
The Jedi Council has instructed me to investigate this matter. May I search your estate?
Please, find Shen and rescue him before my father does something he will regret forever. I would take you to the prison, but I cannot let my father see me with you.
There are many security droids guarding the halls. Please hurry... you are Shen's only hope.
Shen and I... we... Well, we have been taught by our families to hate each other, just for being related to our fathers.
But I met Shen alone one day in the city, away from his father, and...
... and Shen was so charming, so sweet. He didn't care at all that I was a Sandral, he just accepted me for who I was, with no reservations.
We talked and met again over months and fell in love. My brother Casus met him too and they were beginning to become friends, but then this whole mess had to happen...
Ahlan Matale and my father have had problems ever since they settled on this world.
To hear my father tell it, Ahlan is a brute and a bully, but a rich one. He feels his credits give him the right to step all over normal people.
My father stands up to Ahlan because no one else will. But now he thinks Ahlan has taken my brother Casus, and has imprisoned Shen as revenge.
Please find Shen and free him! You are my only hope!
Take this key. It will open an unguarded door at the rear of the estate. You and Shen can make your escape through there.
What are you doing here? Have you found Shen yet?
Shen can be so stubborn sometimes! If one of the security droids sees me wandering the halls Father will get suspicious! I can't risk it!
I know Shen would rather die than leave me here alone to face the wrath of my father. Tell Shen I will meet you outside the gates. I will wait as long as I can, but you must hurry.
You made your wishes clear to me the last time we talked. I won't bother you anymore - though I would ask you to leave our estate. This is private property.
I did not realize the Jedi were such bullies. Unfortunately, there is little I can do if you refuse to respect my wishes. I shall not bother you anymore.
Apologize? Then you will help me?
You are here from the Council, are you not? Looking for Shen Matale?
I... I thought you would listen to me. I thought the Jedi were compassionate and kind! I shouldn't have spoken to you at all - I've just made everything worse!
There could be a lot of money for finding Shen Matale. I think that girl knows something about him going missing.
Yeah, that's the way to go about it. Make things worse for these people, why don't you?
The Council would not approve of your actions here. Perhaps we should find this girl and try to help her.
My name is Rahasia - Nurik is my father. He has not been himself since Casus disappeared. He is mad with grief, and he is convinced the Matales are responsible. He is not thinking rationally.
Casus is dead? It is as I feared, though I am relieved the Matales are not responsible.
Yes. Casus was my brother. He was working on archeological digs here on Dantooine when he disappeared. My father blamed Ahlan Matale... and his son...
My father is a good man. When my mother died, he raised me and my brother by himself. He loves his children, and we love him. I just don't want you to judge him too harshly.
You must understand that Father has been under a terrible strain. I have no wish to disobey him, but there are matters where even my father's authority is not absolute.
My father has kidnapped Shen Matale. He is holding him prisoner here in the compound. He feels this is a way to get back at the Matales, a way to get even for the disappearance of my brother Casus.
Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable. He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus.
I am afraid my father will simply kill Shen out of a mad, misguided lust for vengeance!
I do not know. I am worried for him, truly, but I do not believe Ahlan Matale had anything to do with it... and now my father may take it out on Shen...
Shen is an innocent victim in all this. My father is not a bad man, but his grief has driven him to madness. He must be stopped.
The Jedi Council does not have the authority to search our estate, and if Father finds out his secret has been revealed he might kill Shen right away.
We should inform the Jedi Council of this crime.
No! Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable, he might hurt him if you do that! He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus.
I see. Well there is the answer we seek. The Jedi Council should be informed of this at once.
You don't think that perhaps there's more to look at here, do you? That maybe everything isn't what it appears?
Of course not. It seems very simple to me. The Council must be allowed to decide the next step.
I will go now.
Why do you care about Shen?
What is the problem between your families?
Come with me Rahasia... it's the only way Shen will leave the estate.
I'm trying to rescue Shen, but he won't leave without you, Rahasia.
I'll leave when I'm good and ready!
I have come to apologize for my earlier behavior.
I am here to find Shen Matale. Maybe we can help each other.
Yes, I will help you.
What I do is my own business, so back off!
I just came to tell your Nurik about his son Casus.
Do you know something about Shen's disappearance?
Who are you?
Casus was killed by kath hounds. The Matales had nothing to do with it!
Casus disappeared?
I don't have time to listen to this.
Does this have anything to do with what happened to Shen?
Tell me what's going on here!
Judge him? What has your father done?
I only want to find Shen Matale.
Quit stalling and get to the point!
Please, tell me what has happened.
What happened to Casus?
Why are you telling me all this?
This isn't my problem.
I must tell the Jedi Council at once!
If you can convince Rahasia to escape with us I will accompany you - though I do not know if she would be willing to turn her back on her home and family.
Who could imagine a Sandral doing such a thing for the sake of a Matale. But if she will not go, then I too shall stay.
I would rather face my own death, than have her face her father's wrath because I escaped.
Thank you. I wish you luck.
I was taught to hate the Sandrals. To think of them as evil and subhuman. But from the moment I saw Rahasia one day in the city, I knew that my father was wrong.
She was like an angel: all white silks and perfume, seeming to float above the crowds.
I don't know what else I could have done but fall in love with her. For months I wooed her and tried to win her heart. I believe I have succeeded, but now this has happened...
Our families are always coming between us in one way or another. Please find her and convince her to run away with me.
My father thinks the Sandrals are thieves and liars who followed him here to Dantooine just to steal what he has earned for himself.
My father is an egotist and can be violent at times, but I think he still cares for me. Rahasia's father seems to be falling into the same pattern as mine.
They're both too unreasonable to be talked to about the other. I think the only hope Rahasia and I will have is if we can escape both of them...
Please find Rahasia and speak to her. Get her to flee this place with me.
You are back. Have you spoken to Rahasia?
I pray she is not just telling me what I want to hear. But I will have to take that chance. Hurry, then. We must not keep Rahasia waiting.
Who are you? What do you want with me? Are you working for my father?
As you wish. I have no quarrel with you.
Rescue me? No... I won't leave. It's too dangerous.
It is not my own safety I am concerned about. I am worried about the fate of Nurik's daughter, Rahasia. She has been trying to convince her father to release me ever since I was captured.
If I escape, Nurik will think Rahasia is to blame. Nurik is insane with grief over the loss of his son Casus. If I leave with you, it is Rahasia who will suffer. I cannot allow that.
If you do that, I'll scream my head off and alert all the guards in the house! The only chance you have is to talk Rahasia into leaving.
I will go speak to Rahasia.
Why do you care so much about Rahasia?
Why do your families hate each other so much?
Yes. She promised she would meet us outside the gates.
Anyone tell you you ask too many questions? Now sit down and shut up!
I am here to rescue you, Shen.
I'll protect you, Shen. Let's go.
If you don't come with me, I'll drag you out!
Fine. Stay in here and rot.
What if we take Rahasia with us?
How can I get you to come with me?

You felt it, yes? Another vision? The Force continues to work through us; showing us the Star Maps unearthed by Revan and Malak.
Another vision. The Force is guiding us, helping us retrace the steps of Malak and his old Master. Leading us ever closer to the Star Forge.
The Force has given us a... a vision. Like the one we shared on Dantooine. Did you see it? Of course... you must have. The Force is strong with us both.
It is strange that anyone would have built a Star Map here; the entire surface of Manaan is covered by nothing but vast oceans.
It is possible. The melting of polar caps or a cataclysmic earthquake could have buried the land beneath the waves eons ago. Records from that time are incomplete.
The ocean floor is vast and much of it is uncharted, even by the native Selkath. But how could Revan and Malak have found their way down?
Tatooine is known for little but blowing sand. I find it surprising that there would be a Star Map somewhere in its desolate wastes.
Perhaps, though that would have been tens of thousands of years in the past. Now there is nothing but the howling emptiness of the Dune Sea.
The Star Map would likely have to be within some kind of shelter to protect it against dust and sandstorms.
I suspect there are many such caves and caverns hidden in the sands of the Dune Sea. The creatures of this world probably use them as their lairs.
Kashyyyk is a lush but simple and undeveloped world. I would not have expected to find the alien technology of a Star Map here.
The Wookiees of Kashyyyk make their home high among the wroshyr branches; only their bravest warriors dare to descend into the forbidding depths of the forest.
If the Star Map is located far beneath us on the planet's surface, as our vision seems to suggest, it is unlikely the Wookiees even know of its existence.
There are some who believe Korriban is the birth place of the Sith... this planet is an evil place. There are secrets here best left uncovered.
The visions are as much yours as mine - and they are the key to finding the Star Forge and stopping Malak!
You are right, of course. We cannot turn away from the path we have started on... no matter where it may lead.
During the vision I felt cold and trapped; almost as if I was buried alive. It felt... it felt like we were in some kind of tomb.
No doubt things will become more clear once we discover the Star Map's location.
Dantooine... it seems like a lifetime since I last set foot on her surface, though in truth it has only been a few months. We should be safe from Malak here... for now, at least.
Safe? You saw what his fleet did to Taris: there wasn't a building over two stories high left standing! They...they turned the planet into one big pile of rubble.
Even the Sith would think twice before attacking Dantooine. There are many Jedi here, including several of the most powerful Masters of the Order. There is great strength within this place.
We can't just keep running; Malak will find us eventually. We need to regroup; we need a plan.
We can get supplies here and recuperate. The Academy is a place of mental and spiritual healing; something we could all use after what we've been through.
Maybe you're right. It isn't easy to witness the annihilation of an entire planet. I know Mission must be taking it pretty hard.
She will find a way to come to terms with her grief. She is stronger than she appears. We just need to give her time.
Now I must go speak with the Council. I need their advice on... recent developments. After I have met with them I will meet you outside the ship.
Maybe the land was once above the surface.
It looked like the Star Map was underwater.
Maybe Tatooine wasn't always a desert.
It looked like it was inside some kind of cave.
Do you think the Wookiees are involved?
It looked like the Star Map was on the forest floor.
I don't have time for your visions, Bastila!
We have to uncover those secrets if we want to stop Malak.
It looked like the Star Map was in some sort of cave.
I think Carth has a point. We should keep moving.
I agree with Bastila. We should be safe here.
What was that? What's wrong? Did one of the Sith fighters hit us?
No, it's something else. We've flown into some kind of disruptor field. All my instruments are jammed... we've got massive overloads on all systems!
I'm picking up a single planet in this system. I'll try and put us down here. Hold on - this may be a rough landing.
The Star Forge... it's huge. I've never seen anything like it before.
I can feel the power of the dark side emanating from that space station. It almost feels like... like it's alive. That must be where Malak has taken Bastila.
I'm transmitting these co-ordinates to Admiral Dodonna. Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet.
Message is away. We should probably wait for the Republic fleet to show up before we try and rescue Bastila. We'll need cover if we want to fly in and dock on the Star Forge.
We've got company... a small vanguard of Sith fighters, coming in hard! Get on those gun turrets! Take those fighters out before they report our position to the main fleet!

Let's get out of here before they close those docking bay doors!
Hey, where's Bastila? What happened on the ship?
Where is Bastila? What happened on that ship?
Where is Bastila? What happened on the ship?
We ran into Malak. He would have killed us, but Bastila sacrificed herself so we could get away.
You mean she's... she's dead?
Malak won't kill her. I think he'll want to use her battle meditation against the Republic. He'll keep her alive so he can turn her to the dark side!
The Dark Lord will not kill her. He will want to use her battle meditation ability against the Republic. He will take her alive so he can turn her to the dark side. I am sure of it.
Bah. Malak won't kill her, don't be foolish. He'll want to use her battle meditation against the Republic. Turn her to the dark side and the Sith will always be victorious.
Not so fast. We've got a bigger issue to deal with here. They deserve to know the truth about you. Do you want to tell them what Malak said, or should I?
Threats? You can't bully me - though I shouldn't be surprised now that I know who you really are... Revan.
Revan? What... what are you talking about? Is this some kind of joke?
No, it's no joke. The Jedi Council captured Revan and erased the Dark Lord's mind, programming in a new identity. Saul Karath told me on the Leviathan and Bastila confirmed it!
You're Darth Revan? This is... this is big. Do you... do you remember anything about being the Dark Lord?
And so the lies begin. It was obvious you remembered something back there when Malak confronted you with the truth. It might have only been small pieces, but there was something there!
Just a few flashes? That's it? Nothing more? Then I don't think there's a problem.
It seems to me that if you don't really remember anything about being Revan, then it doesn't really matter anymore. You are who you are now, right?
Of course it still matters! How do we know more memories won't come flooding back? How do we know Revan won't suddenly turn on us?
The whole time we've been chasing after Malak we've had his old Sith Master right at our side; listening to our secrets; hearing our plans!
Big Z and I will stick by you. We owe you our lives; we won't desert you now!
How can you say that, Mission? The Sith bombed my home world! Revan took away my family and destroyed my life!
Everyone knows it was Malak who gave the order to attack your people, Carth. You can't blame Revan for that.
I... I suppose you've proven yourself to be a friend of the Republic by your actions so far... Revan. But can I trust you? Can any of us?
It, uh... it all makes sense now... Revan. I've watched you, I've seen your cruelty. I've seen your... your dark side. And now this! I don't know if I can trust you. Can any of us?
It was Saul Karath who commanded the fleet that attacked your people, Carth. And it was Malak who gave the order. You know this.
I have felt the presence of the dark side in you, Revan - as it is in all of us. I know the dangers of that path; yet I also know the fallen can be redeemed.
I can tell there is conflict between light and darkness within you. I do not know which way the struggle will turn, but I will not abandon you in this difficult time, as you did not abandon me.
I have seen signs of the taint of the dark side in your actions and deeds, but I will not give up on you as you did not give up on me. I will stay with you, Revan.
I judge you by your actions, and as long as we have been together I have seen you act as a servant of the light.
I don't know. Maybe I just need time to, uh... to think about it.
The others seem to trust you... and we need you to stop the Sith. And I suppose Malak is the real enemy here. But I don't have much choice but to go along with this for now, do I?
Well, the others seem to trust you... and I don't see any other way that we can stop the Sith. And I suppose that Malak is the real enemy here... I really don't have any other choice, do I?
Don't worry - I won't let my personal feelings get in the way of my assignments or this mission. But don't forget: I've sworn an oath to defend the Republic!
As long as this mission stays on course I'll stick with you. But I won't let you betray the Republic under any circumstances!
So I guess that's it then... we keep going. We've still got one more Star Map to uncover if we're going to find that Star Forge and save Bastila, so let's do it before it's too late.
I see. Well, I guess that answers a lot of my questions about who you really are.
I want to believe you. You've proven yourself time and time again during our mission, but this is a little much for me to wrap my mind around.
This must be even more of a shock to you... I don't know how you even keep going. I guess we both just have to find a way to push forward.
Don't worry about me - I'm a soldier. I can put aside my misgivings for now. We can, uh... we can talk later, you and I. Just give me time.
Beep! Beep! Beep! Woop-woooop!
I knew the little guy would come through for you - droids don't hold grudges.
Commentary: I am... experiencing something unusual, master.
Answer: My programming is activating my deleted memory core. I believe I have a... a homing system that is restoring it, master.
Observation: That is unnecessary, master. My intent is not hostile. I am receiving no combat override commands.
Observation: My homing system is a function of my assassination protocols... that which I told you had been de-activated. This system was not.
It seems that the homing system deliberately restores my deleted memory core upon... upon returning to my original master.
Affirmation: Correct, master. Sith protocols maintain that all droid knowledge be deleted before assassination missions, and restored upon return.
I have returned to you, and my full functionality is now under your personal command. It is a distinct pleasure to see you again, master.
Commentary: I believe I have served you well in the past, master, and will continue to do so for as long as you have need of me.
Wow. What are the chances of that happening?
Remember we're talking about the Force, here. At this point Malak himself could drop out of the sky and I wouldn't bat an eyelash.
Beep! Beep-beep boop! Bwoooop.
Good point.
Observation: That does not matter, master. I am your droid, regardless of your actions or personality.
Think you'd never heard of the Force before. Seems obvious enough to me it was meant to be.
Observation: Indeed. I do hope we shall have the chance to engage in combat together again soon, master.
Explanation: I believe so, master. I was unaware of my homing system until it had been activated.
You defeated the Mandalore clans in the war, Revan. You were the only one in the galaxy who could best us.
We had never met one like you before, and never since. How can you even ask if I will follow you?
Whatever you are fighting, it will be worthy of my skill. I'm your man until the end, Revan, no matter how this plays out.
What about me? I already knew who you were, though it wasn't my place to tell you. Better off that you know, if you ask me.
Does it change anything? I'm not here to judge you. You'll do what you have to, and I'll help if I can.
I don't know if I can get over it that easily, Mission. I mean... after all Revan did... how could any of us forgive her?
I don't see the Sith Lord standing here, I see a friend who's been with us through thick and thin! Remember - Malak's the one who tried to destroy Taris!
I agree with Mission. I swore a life-debt to the person you are, not to the person you were.
Hey - you've got nothing to be sorry about! You didn't ask for this. Besides, I know you... you're not Revan anymore. Whatever you used to be, you're one of us now!
I've been such a fool! I... I swore to protect you! And here you were the enemy all this time!
Oh, it changes everything! It was... it was you! You were the one that attacked my world! You were the one that destroyed my life!
It doesn't matter who's to blame. You're still the one who did it. You killed my wife... you betrayed everything that I believed in! You destroyed my life!
But it is true. It's horribly true! It was...it was you... you killed my wife, you ravaged my world. You...you destroyed my life!
But... you're the one responsible for the death of my wife, the destruction of my home world! You destroyed my life!
How could I have been such a fool! How could I have not known?! How could you betray me like this?!
Get over it? Yeah... yeah, I can get over it. I should have figured out earlier you weren't what you seemed. That's my fault.
Do you think everybody else is going to be so quick to 'get over it'? You think they're going to follow a Sith Lord?
You should have known. I...*sigh* I should have figured it out. I just can't... was, was everything a lie, then? Everything we talked about?
This isn't a joke. You know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about you, about the way you felt...
Was the woman we knew Revan or... or someone else? Will you change into Revan? How...how can any of us trust you?
Well, I trust you! I know you... and you're not Revan anymore. Whatever you used to be, you're one of us now!
That's what I feared. Who's to say your old life won't come back... everything you felt and thought, all of it?
Are you sure? I'm not sure what to believe any more. Who's to say that your old life won't come back... all of it?
Not so fast. I need to know if what Malak said about you is true or not, first. You aren't... you *can't* be, can you?
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by your attitude now that I know who you really are... Revan.
We can't help Bastila - not unless we find the Star Forge first.
We have to go back for Bastila!
Say one word and you're dead, Carth!
I'll tell them. I'm... I'm Darth Revan.
I don't care what Malak said! I'm not Darth Revan, I'm <FullName>.
I don't remember anything about being Revan.
Small bits. A few strange dreams and visions. That's all.
This changes nothing! I still want to stop Malak!
Well, Carth... what are you going to do?
Well, Carth - will you stand with me against Malak?
You're right - you don't have a choice! I'm in charge here!
I'm not Revan anymore, Carth. You have to believe that.
I won't let you down, Carth. I promise.
You have to find a way to deal with this, Carth.
How do you think I feel?
You have to try... for Bastila's sake.
You won't abandon me, will you T3?
What do you have to say, HK-47?
Why? What's happening?
I'll destroy you if you make a move, droid!
Your homing system? What's that?
You mean... Revan?
Good. So long as you're loyal.
I'm not exactly Revan anymore, HK-47...
But I found you, you didn't find me!
Well... that makes a lot of sense, actually.
Everyone be careful... there's no telling what this means!
So this is the... stimuli you were waiting for?
What do you think, Canderous?
What about you, Jolee?
Blame the Jedi Council for this, Carth - not me!
But I'm not the Dark Lord anymore, I'm <FullName>. I'm one of you!
I'm sorry, Carth... I wish this wasn't true.
This changes nothing. I am who I am.
Blame the Jedi Council for this, Carth - not me!
I'm sorry, Carth... I wish this wasn't true.
I'm not your enemy, Carth, I swear!
Get over it, Carth. We've got more important things to think about.
Please, Carth... don't do this to me!
I didn't know I was Revan! How could I have known?!
Why? Were you lying to me all that time?
I don't know. Everything has changed, now.
Everything that was important was real, Carth.
Back off, Carth! There's nothing you can do about it!
It looks that way. I'm... Darth Revan.

You felt it, yes? Another vision? The Force continues to work through us; showing us the Star Maps unearthed by Revan and Malak.
Another vision. The Force is guiding us, helping us retrace the steps of Malak and his old Master. Leading us ever closer to the Star Forge.
The Force has given us a... a vision. Like the one we shared on Dantooine. Did you see it? Of course... you must have. The Force is strong with us both.
It is strange that anyone would have built a Star Map here; the entire surface of Manaan is covered by nothing but vast oceans.
It is possible. The melting of polar caps or a cataclysmic earthquake could have buried the land beneath the waves eons ago. Records from that time are incomplete.
The ocean floor is vast and much of it is uncharted, even by the native Selkath. But how could Revan and Malak have found their way down?
Tatooine is known for little but blowing sand. I find it surprising that there would be a Star Map somewhere in its desolate wastes.
Perhaps, though that would have been tens of thousands of years in the past. Now there is nothing but the howling emptiness of the Dune Sea.
The Star Map would likely have to be within some kind of shelter to protect it against dust and sandstorms.
I suspect there are many such caves and caverns hidden in the sands of the Dune Sea. The creatures of this world probably use them as their lairs.
Kashyyyk is a lush but simple and undeveloped world. I would not have expected to find the alien technology of a Star Map here.
The Wookiees of Kashyyyk make their home high among the Wroshyr branches; only their bravest warriors dare to descend into the forbidding depths of the forest.
If the Star Map is located far beneath us on the planet's surface, as our vision seems to suggest, it is unlikely the Wookiees even know of its existence.
There are some who believe Korriban is the birth place of the Sith... this planet is an evil place. There are secrets here best left uncovered.
The visions are as much yours as mine - and they are the key to finding the Star Forge and stopping Malak!
You are right, of course. We cannot turn away from the path we have started on... no matter where it may lead.
During the vision I felt cold and trapped; almost as if I was buried alive. It felt... it felt like we were in some kind of tomb.
No doubt things will become more clear once we discover the Star Map's location.
Dantooine... it seems like a lifetime since I last set foot on her surface, though in truth it has only been a few months. We should be safe from Malak here... for now, at least.
Safe? You saw what his fleet did to Taris: there wasn't a building over two stories high left standing! They turned the planet into one big pile of rubble.
Even the Sith would think twice before attacking Dantooine. There are many Jedi here, including several of the most powerful Masters of the Order. There is great strength within this place.
We can't just keep running; Malak will find us eventually. We need to regroup; we need a plan.
We can get supplies here and recuperate. The Academy is a place of mental and spiritual healing; something we could all use after what we've been through.
Maybe you're right. It isn't easy to witness the annihilation of an entire planet. I know Mission must be taking it pretty hard.
She will find a way to come to terms with her grief. She is stronger than she appears. We just need to give her time.
Now I must go speak with the Council. I need their advice on... recent developments. After I have met with them I will meet you outside the ship.
Maybe the land was once above the surface.
It looked like the Star Map was underwater.
Maybe Tatooine wasn't always a desert.
It looked like it was inside some kind of cave.
Do you think the Wookiees are involved?
It looked like the Star Map was on the forest floor.
I don't have time for your visions, Bastila!
We have to uncover those secrets if we want to stop Malak.
It looked like the Star Map was in some sort of cave.
I think Carth has a point. We should keep moving.
I agree with Bastila. We should be safe here.
What was that? What's wrong? Did one of the Sith fighters hit us?
No, it's something else. We've flown into some kind of disruptor field. All my instruments are jammed... we've got massive overloads on all systems!
I'm picking up a single planet in this system. I'm gonna try and put us down there. Hold on - this might be a rough landing.
The Star Forge... it's huge. I've never seen anything like it before.
I can feel the power of the dark side emanating from that space station. It almost feels like... like it's alive. That must be where Malak has taken Bastila.
I'm transmitting these co-ordinates to Admiral Dodonna. Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet.
Message is away. We should probably wait for the Republic fleet to show up before we try and rescue Bastila. We'll need cover if we want to fly in and dock on the Star Forge.
We've got company... a small vanguard of Sith fighters, coming in hard! Get on those gun turrets! Take those fighters out before they report our position to the main fleet!

Hey, where are you going? We can't leave the planet yet. Remember all those wrecked ships we saw?
Until we get inside that temple and find some way to disable that disruptor field, the Ebon Hawk is grounded.
We need to salvage some new stabilizers or the Ebon Hawk won't even be able to get off the ground.
Whew! Talk about your rough landings, Carth! What's the matter? You're flying like you've been on an all night Tarisian ale drinking binge!
That disruptor field fried our stabilizers - we're lucky we made it down in one piece! But if we can't find the salvage to make repairs I won't even be able to get the Ebon Hawk airborne again!
You know, during our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Maybe the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.
The old man's right: this planet's a technological graveyard. I saw dozens of downed ships out there. That disruptor field must have wiped them all out.
Even if we get the stabilizers fixed, we'll have to find and disable the source of that disruptor field before we can take off. Otherwise we'll just end up crashing again.
They must have some kind of protection against it. But the Republic fleet won't. We have to find a way to disable that disruptor field or the Sith will slaughter them!
You're right! That Sith fleet we saw must have some type of protection against the disruptor field. We have to find a way to disable it or the Republic will be slaughtered!
There's massive power fluctuations on the ship's sensors. They seem to be coming from some type of large stone structure to the east... it looks like some kind of ancient temple.
Beep, boop, beep.
T3's picking up massive power fluctuations on the ship's sensors. They seem to be coming from some type of large stone structure to the east... it looks like some kind of ancient temple.
Good idea. If that temple's generating power it probably has something to do with that disruptor field.
The stabilizers won't do much good if we don't disable that disruptor field first. Otherwise, we'll end up crashing back down to the planet's surface again. And this time we might not survive!
Hey, don't forget about Bastila, guys! We still have to rescue her, too.
We haven't forgotten about her. But we can't do her much good stuck down here. We have to help ourselves before we can help her.
I just hope we're not too late. Bastila's been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he turns her to the dark side she'll join him and the Sith will become invincible.
I only hope we're not too late. Bastila has been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he can turn her to the dark side she will join him and the Sith will be invincible.
I remember... though I hoped you would not be so quick to embrace the being you once were. If Bastila feels as you do then she is lost to us, Revan.
I fear Bastila will find the lure of the dark side difficult to resist. She is strong in the Force, but she is also impulsive, willful and proud - as you once were, Revan.
Let us hope it does not come to that.
Well, if Bastila is on the Star Forge like you think, Jolee, then we can't rescue her until we disable that disruptor field. The sooner we investigate that temple to the east the better.
We can probably find the wreckage of a downed ship along the way. If we're lucky we can salvage some stabilizers from it to get off this planet.
I hope everything works out as smooth as you make it sound, Carth.
So do I, Mission. So do I.
I am glad to hear you say that. Now that you know your true identity I was afraid you might slip back over to the dark side. If Bastila feels as you do there may yet be hope for her.
During our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Perhaps the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.
The Cathar's right: this planet's a technological graveyard. I saw dozens of downed ships out there. That disruptor field must have wiped them all out. But where could it be coming from?
Bastila - you're alive! I was worried about you. For a minute there I was sure we'd never see you again once Malak got his... wait a minute.
Where's Jolee Bindo? Is he okay? What happened inside that temple?
Where are Juhani and Jolee Bindo? Are they okay? What happened inside that temple?
What... what are you talking about?
The Jedi Council has failed, Carth - Darth Revan has been reborn! Together we will destroy Malak and seize control of his fleet, then use it to crush the Republic!
Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. He died for his foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!
Juhani and Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. They died for their foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!
No - we serve the Republic! You're no better than Malak! We'll never swear allegiance to one who serves the dark side!
Wait, Lord Revan. Carth speaks only for himself - he does not speak for the others. He may find he stands alone here!
The droids will continue to serve you Revan - they are programmed to obey their master. And there may be others who will choose to join us.
The Republic is doomed, Revan has returned! Who will now swear loyalty to the second coming of the Dark Lord?
You're Revan and I'll follow you anywhere. It doesn't matter who you're fighting against, I'll be at your side. Mandalorians don't have any great love for the Republic anyway.
Light side, dark side - it doesn't make any difference to me, Revan. I'll stick by your side no matter what comes.
I saw what the Sith did to Taris - anyone who serves the dark side is evil! Big Z and I are with Carth on this one!
No, Mission. I am bound by the oath of my life debt. I... I must stand with Revan.
Zaalbar - Revan's a Sith! Just like Malak! It's not a betrayal if you break your life debt now!
If I go back on my vow I am betraying myself, my people and my ancestors. I cannot do that. Please, Mission - join us.
No, Zaalbar. I don't care! I won't help the Sith against the Republic! Not for anything! Not even for you!
You don't have to help the Sith, Mission. Not while I'm here.
Run for it, Mission! Get to the jungle! Go! Go!
No, Carth! Don't do it!
I won't let you do this to yourself. I... I love you. No matter what.
Run for it, Mission! Get to the jungle! Go! Go!
Let him go! We have more important things to worry about. We have to get to the Star Forge and kill Malak. Then we can turn our attention to the Republic.
No, you can't mean that! This... this isn't you! You're not Revan, I know it!
You've got to resist it! This isn't you talking... we can help you, we can find a way to --
My, my. I think the sad fool may actually be in love with you, Revan.
I refuse to believe that! We'll stop you if we have to, all of us. We'll save you from yourselves!
Never! You're not the woman I love. We'll stop you if we have to, all of us.
You're back! But where's Bastila? Is she alive? What happened inside that Temple?
Hold on a second! What about Bastila? Wasn't she in the Temple? What happened?
Dead? I... I can't believe it.
She's not dead, Carth - though that might have been easier for you to accept. She's fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.
She is not dead, Carth - though maybe that might have been easier for you to accept. She has fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.
The dark side? Bastila? No! How could that happen?
She was always in danger of being seduced by the dark side, Carth. Bastila was strong, but she was always impatient and headstrong. Malak preyed upon her weaknesses.
This planet is a tainted place, the Star Forge and the Temple have twisted the Force into an instrument of evil - just as Malak has twisted Bastila into a servant of the Sith.
Weakness has nothing to do with the corruption of the dark side. A Jedi must always guard against pride and the desire for power. Especially you.
In the end we all choose our own path, but keep in mind the role that you played in her downfall. You and the task assigned to her by the Jedi Council.
Remember the bond that was forged between you when she rekindled the spark that was your life. Through that bond she touched your memories... and also the echo of the dark taint within you.
But there's still hope for her, right? I mean, Revan rejected the dark side so Bastila could too, right? We still might be able to save her.
I'm not sure what's in store for us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play. I have no doubt she'll be waiting for us on the Star Forge.
I don't know what fate awaits us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play in the events to come. I have no doubt she will be waiting for us on the Star Forge.
No doubt. Let's go, then, before she has time to organize a bigger welcoming committee.
No doubt. I must say that it's good to have you with us, my dear. For a minute there I thought you might decide... well, never mind what I thought.
Decide? Decide what?
Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.
Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.
So... you did it? You turned against Revan once and for all? I knew she wasn't part of you anymore. I knew it.
I told you that you would have to make a choice eventually, that you would be tested. I think that was it, I can feel it.
And you did exactly what I'd hoped you would. It couldn't have been easy... I'm very proud of you.
Always. I'm not certain any one of us wouldn't have been tempted by Bastila's offer.
I... I love you. I can't wait until all of this is over with.
Right. Sorry. I just... can't remember the last time I felt this happy. I can wait until the Star Forge is destroyed.
You make that sound so easy. Just fly over and boom, one less Star Forge in the universe, huh?
I feel more confident now than I ever did before. The Force is with us, Mission.
Well, I'm an old man and I know you should take love when you can find it. Good for you two, I say.
Beep! Beep-beep boop!!
Answer: I have no idea what they speak of, droid. Organic meatbags are an eternal mystery to me.
Confidence is all well and good, Carth, but if we are going to catch up to Bastila we should leave soon, don't you think?
Okay - let's get moving. The longer we wait the harder this is going to be!
Hey! Sheesh... get a room, will ya?
That two spirits have found each other amidst such turmoil is a good omen, Mission. Does it not please you to see?
Oh, sure. Even a good omen can get itself a room, though, don't ya think?
I know. I can't blame Bastila for being turned, however... she's just so young and doesn't deserve this kind of fate.
I'm sure she did. I can't say that any one of us wouldn't have been tempted.
Malak has a strong hold on Bastila now - it will be difficult for her to break free of his influence. Especially considering her long association with you.
I wonder why the Sith ships aren't affected by the disruptor field?
That disruptor field could wipe out the entire Republic fleet!
Let's go check it out.
Hey - I thought we needed to find some stabilizers for the ship!
You all seem to be forgetting about Bastila!
Even together they are no match for me. I used to be the Sith Lord, remember?
Bastila would never turn to the dark side!
If Bastila's joined Malak then she'll suffer the same fate he does!
Don't call me that. I'm not Revan anymore.
He didn't make it.
I went over to the dark side, Carth. That's what happened.
They didn't make it.
I have reclaimed the title of Darth Revan! Bow before me!
I guess I'll just have to kill you all, then.
Not everyone is as foolish as you are, Carth!
Not everyone is willing to throw their life away for the Republic, Carth!
Zaalbar, what about you?
Mission, what about you?
It's too bad it had to come to this, Carth.
Then I guess it's time for you to die!
You don't stand a chance against all of us, Carth.
You're a fool. You always were.
And just what are you going to do about it?
That doesn't matter any more, Carth.
Only you serve the Republic, Carth. You don't speak for the others.
If you resist me, Carth, I'll destroy you!
Don't be a blind fool, Carth. Open your eyes.
How sad. I guess there's no future for us after all, is there?
All of you? Are you sure of that?
Don't resist me, Carth, or I'll be forced to destroy you.
Join me, Carth. You can rule at my side, it's not too late.
This is my choice, Carth, whether you like it or not.
Does it matter who I am? I have joined the dark side.
I am Revan, Carth. Now and forever.
No time! We have to get off this planet and get to the Star Forge!
Bastila is dead, Carth. Malak killed her.
Bastila has fallen to the dark side. She fled to the Star Forge.
Bastila is lost to us now. She deserves to die.
Malak corrupted Bastila because she was weak.
I can't help but feel this is partly my fault.
It's too late for her. Just accept it.
It took the whole Jedi Council and a mind wipe to save me. What chance does she have?
We can try... and we will.
Once and for all? What are you talking about?
Thank you. I appreciate the support.
We've got a long way to go yet, Carth.
Hey, cool your engines there.
I love you, too.
I could never do what Bastila did.
It wasn't easy at all. Bastila made a good case.
I chose the light side. It's true.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Anything can still happen.
She can still be saved, can't she?

Endar Spire - Command Module
Bastila's escape pod's already gone, so there's no reason for us to stick around here and get shot by the Sith. Now come on - there'll be time for questions later!
You made it just in time! There's only one active escape pod left. Come on, we can hide out on the planet below!
I'm a soldier with the Republic, like you. We're the last two crew members left on the Endar Spire.
Be careful! There's a whole squad of Sith Troopers on the other side of that door! You need to find some way to thin their numbers.
You could reprogram the damaged assault droid to help you, if you have enough repair parts.
Or you could use computer spikes to slice into the terminal and use the Endar Spire's security systems against the Sith.
First, make sure you have a stealth field generator equipped on your belt. You can't use your stealth skill without one.
But be careful. There's a Sith patrol just down the corridor. Use your STEALTH skill to sneak past him.
Bastila's escape pod is away - you're the last surviving crew member of the Endar Spire! I can't wait for you much longer; you have to get to the escape pods!
You're the last Republic survivor on the Endar Spire! You have to get off the ship!
This is Carth Onasi on your personal communicator. I'm tracking your position through the Endar Spire's life support systems.
How do I know I can trust you?
Who are you?
[Security Lockdown. Access code required.]
[Security Lockdown. Hostiles in close proximity. Access denied.]
Bastila's not here on the bridge - they must have retreated to the escape pods! We better head that way too.
STAR WARS Knights of the Old Republic is a real-time turn based game. Each time you issue a command to a character they will carry out that action over the course of a three-second round.
Pressing a button multiple times won't make you perform commands any faster, but it will put that command into the action queue that appears to the left of the portrait of the selected character.
At the start of the next round the character will perform the next action in the que. You can have up to 3 commands in your action que.
Remember, it can take up to 3 rounds, or 9 seconds, for the last command entered into the action queue to take effect. If the queue is full new commands will overwrite previous commands.
You're injured! You better use that medpac you equipped in your quickslot. First, you have to select the character you want to use the medpac on.
Press the [WHITE] button to unpause.
Use the black button to cycle through the party members until you see your portrait highlighted at the bottom of the screen, then press the corresponding trigger to use the item in the quickslot.
Press the [WHITE] button to unpause.
Press "A" when the desired target is highlighted, then press the white button to unpause the game. You will throw your grenade once the action resumes.
Combat uses a pause and play system. Press the white button to pause and unpause the game so you can issue commands to your characters.
While paused you can still use the D-pad and black button to cycle through targets and party members.
Any commands you issue to your party while paused will go into an action queue. When you resume gameplay the commands will fire in the order you selected them.
The game is paused right now. In pause mode, set up your main character to throw a grenade at one of the Sith Troopers. Press "BACK" to resume the game after you issue your commands.
We'll be fighting in close quarters on the bridge. You better equip a melee weapon before we go through that door.
Just press [START] to bring up your menus and go to the EQUIP screen. Then set up items in your quickslots the same way you would equip weapons or armor.
During normal gameplay, press the left or right trigger to use the corresponding quickslot.
Highlight one of your quickslots and press "A" to bring up a list of available items. Grenades, medpacs and similar items can be equipped by highlighting the desired item and pressing "A".
Using a quickslot from the main screen does not pause the game, and is more convenient than using the EQUIP or INVENTORY screens. Everyone in the party shares the same two quickslots.
The bridge is just beyond that door. You better equip your melee weapon. There isn't much room on the bridge, and it's suicide to use a blaster in close quarters.
Your melee weapon is made using a cortosis weave. It's strong enough to stand up against anything, even a lightsaber.
Remember, you can access your map and other important menus by pressing the [START] button. Then use the triggers to scroll to the MAP screen.
Use the left trigger to scroll to the MAP screen. This shows your current location and the direction you are facing, as well as notes marking important locations in the area.
The corridor branches off. You better check your map to make sure we're going the right way!
To use a computer simply target the terminal and press "A". This will bring up a computer screen with a list of commands you can enter at that terminal.
Just target the computer and press "A" to slice into it.
The higher your computer skill, the less spikes it will take to override the system. The number of spikes to perform an action is displayed beside each command.
Sometimes you will select an option that is not possible. In this case you will get a message saying "SPIKE REJECTION". You will not lose your spikes in this case.
Okay, the maintenance droid is here, but he's damaged too! Don't worry, you can use your droid repair skills and some repair parts to fix him.
Switch to me and use my repair skills on that disabled droid. Maybe I can reprogram it to ram the door open for us.
Maybe you can use your repair skill to reprogram that disabled droid to ram the door open for us.
To use your repair skill on a disabled droid, target the droid and press "A". This will bring up a list of actions you can program in, and the number of repair parts the choice will require.
Simply target the disabled droid and press "A" to get the repair options to appear. Fixing droids uses up repair parts.
The harder something is to repair or reprogram, the more parts you need. The higher your repair skill, the less parts you need.
The door's jammed! It must have been damaged during the attack - we'll have to figure out a way to get past it.
Switch to me and use my computer skill on that terminal to see if I can override the system and open the door.
Use that computer terminal to see if you can slice into the system and order up a maintenance droid to fix the door for us.
We have to get to the bridge.
This is Carth Onasi - the Sith are threatening to overrun our position! We can't hold out long against their firepower! All hands to the bridge!
That was Carth contacting us on our portable communicators. He's one of the Republic's best pilots! He's seen more combat than the rest of the Endar Spire's crew put together.
If he says things are bad, you better believe it. We have to get to the bridge to help defend Bastila!
Now that the door's open you better take the lead again.
Target the door using the thumbsticks or the triggers. When the targeting circle is focused on the door, you'll see the icons in the ACTION MENU at the bottom left of the screen have changed.
If the character you control has the security skill it will appear in the action menu. Use the D-pad to scroll up and down to select the SECURITY option, then press "A". If your skill is high enough, the door will open.
Use the D-pad to cycle through the action until SECURITY is highlighted, then press <abutton>. Remember, the SECURITY icon only appears if you're controlling a character with the SECURITY skill.
That door's locked. I don't have the codes to open it, but switch me to the party leader so you can use my security skills to slice into the access panel and open the door.
That door's locked, and I don't have the codes to open it. You'll have to use your security skill on it if we want to get past.
To use an item like a medpac - or to use a feat, skill or Force power - you'll need to know how to use your ACTION MENU.
The [START] button bring ups the menu screens you used before. Use the triggers to cycle through until you reach the EQUIP screen. It shows a portrait of the character you currently control.
Use the triggers to bring up the shared party INVENTORY screen. There is no limit to the number of items your party can carry. Special plot items are stored in a separate inventory.
Your entire party shares the same inventory. There is no limit to the number of items you can carry. If you drop an item from your inventory it is gone from the game.
Use the D-pad to highlight a desired item in your inventory and see its description. Press "A" to use this item on the character you are currently controlling.
You can only use items - like medpacs - on the character you are controlling. You can cycle through the party portraits with the black button to change the character you control.
When you press the [START] button the game will unpause and return to the main screen. Items will activate in the order that you selected them from your inventory.
I've got a feeling that won't be our last battle with the Sith. Good thing we have medpacs to heal our wounds. It might be a good idea to use one now before our next battle.
Now that the door's open you better take the lead again.
You always control the leader of the party. You can switch who is the party leader by pressing <blbutton>.
Press <blbutton> now to switch me to the party leader, then use me to open the door. Simply target the door, then press <abutton> to open it.
Okay, let's move out.
Because of the attack this room is in lockdown, but don't worry - I've got the override codes. You'll have to use me to unlock the door.
You can access your journal, map and other important menus by pressing the [START] button.
You can then pull the left trigger to scroll through the menus listed on the tabs at the top of the screen.
The QUEST screen displays the entries in your electronic journal, including important quest information. Pressing "A" brings up more details about a highlighted entry.
You will hear a message alert whenever you get a new entry in your journal. Check the map and journal entries in your personal datapad before we continue, then talk to me again.
I've uploaded some information into your electronic journal.
Take a look at your journal before we go on. We need to be prepared for whatever the Sith throw at us.
Use the EQUIP screen to equip the armor and weapons from your inventory. You can access this by pressing the [START] button on your controller.
Use the D-pad to cycle through your inventory slots. The menu on the right displays items you can equip in each slot.
Press <abutton> to select an inventory slot, then scroll through the available items and press <abutton> to equip one.
Remember - press [START] to access the EQUIP screen and pause the game. Pressing [START] again will unpause and return you to the main game. Speak to me after you equip your items.
Come on, we have to hurry! The Sith might already be boarding the ship to try and capture Bastila.
Put your equipment on so we can get out of here.
Now that you have your equipment you need to speak to me again. Use the triggers to cycle your targeting circle until it's on me then press "A".
Non-hostile creatures and objects will display a green selection reticle when targeted. Hostile creatures will show up as red. Press the "A" button to initiate dialog once you have me targeted.
Use the right thumbstick to control the camera and the left thumbstick to move towards your footlocker. Press <abutton> to open your locker once it is targeted.
Or you can pull the left and right triggers to cycle between targets until the footlocker is highlighted, then press <abutton> to open it.
You can target an object by facing it, or you can cycle the selection reticle between targets by pressing the D-pad. The camera automatically centers itself on the selected target.
The D-pad lets you scroll through the contents of an open container. Press "A" to pick up the contents. Everything inside will automatically be transferred to your inventory.
We've been ambushed by a Sith battle fleet! The Endar Spire is under attack! Hurry up - we don't have much time!
Did you fall out of your bunk and hit your head? The Endar Spire is the ship we're stationed on - this ship! You probably don't even know who I am, do you?
I'm Trask Ulgo, ensign with the Republic Fleet. I'm your bunk mate here on the Endar Spire. We work opposite shifts; I guess that's why you haven't seen me before.
Now hurry up, we have to find Bastila! We have to make sure she makes it off the ship alive!
You swore an oath to protect Bastila when you signed up with this mission, just like everyone else in the crew! Now it's time to make good on that oath.
I know she may not have an official rank in the fleet, but she's the one in charge of this mission and it's our duty to protect her!
Bastila's the commanding officer on the Endar Spire. Well, not an officer, really. But she's the one in charge of this mission.
You swore an oath to protect Bastila when you signed up with this mission, just like everyone else in the crew! Now it's time to make good on that oath.
One of our primary duties is to guarantee her survival in the event of enemy attack! You swore an oath just like everyone else on this mission. Now it's time to make good on that oath!
But now that you've signed on for this mission you're part of the Republic fleet. And Bastila needs all troops at her side during this attack!
I know you're a scout and not a soldier, but Bastila needs all troops at her side during this attack!
We're soldiers, we're trained for combat. Bastila's going to need men and women like us at her side during this attack!
Don't be stupid! You won't stand a chance against the Sith by yourself. We've got to stick together if we want to make it out of this alive.
So hurry up and grab your gear. You need to suit up so we can get out of here.
The Endar Spire? [Press <abutton> to select highlighted response.]
Who are you? [Press <abutton> to select highlighted response.]
Forget it - I'm looking after my own skin! [Press <abutton> to select highlighted response.]
Who's Bastila? [Press <abutton> to select highlighted response.]
Oath or no oath - I'm heading to the escape pods!
Okay, let's go help Bastila!

Kashyyyk - Czerka Landing Port
Observation: You should have brought the Wookiee Zaalbar, despite the smell. He would have knowledge of this place, master.
Answer: Agreed, but he is the most familiar with Kashyyyk. That is a simple fact.
Retort: "A long time" is still more frequent than "never," which is how many times the rest of us have been here, master.
Hmph. Maybe we should have brought the Wookiee out. This place looks... untamed.
Are you afraid of the wild, Mandalore? Are you a coward?
Mandalorians are not cowards! We're just practical.
It is always good to know as much as possible about a world, and to have a reliable guide. Perhaps we should get Zaalbar to accompany us.
As you will.
A reliable guide through the intricate complexities of another culture can be invaluable.
Perhaps you should reconsider leaving Zaalbar behind. This is, after all, his homeworld.
Is this about power, then? You would rather make a decision for the sake of making it than make it wisely?
I am only suggesting that both we and Zaalbar would benefit from his company while on Kashyyyk. You do want to find the Star Map, don't you?
We know very little of this planet. I also sense that Zaalbar has much that is unresolved here... it may be beneficial to aid him in this respect.
The Wookiee was looking pretty agitated back in the ship. You think it's wise to leave him unattended?
I agree, but he could prove useful. He'd certainly know the place. And I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on him.
He looked like there was something he needed to do. Besides, we don't know this planet. He could prove useful.
Good or bad, he's got to have some interest in Kashyyyk. I'd rather have him with us.
Zaalbar should be here. He shouldn't miss this. He needs to know he can come back here.
I'm not saying that I know better than you, but this is Zaalbar's home. Don't you think he'd know some things?
Besides, he's got things here he needs to take care of.
I can't talk for Big Z, but believe me, he should be with us. He's got... unfinished business here.
Kashyyyk... my home. I should have prepared you for coming here... but I don't know if I've prepared myself.
Don't mock me, this is hard. Mission may have told you I was taken from here by slavers... but there is more.
I didn't leave Kashyyyk voluntarily. Mission must have told you how I was fleeing slavers... but there was more.
I am an exile. The slavers on Kashyyyk only took me after I was forced to leave my village home, 20 years ago.
Then stumble blindly. I won't speak of it again until it is in your face.
My brother made deals with the slavers and allowed them to get a foothold. I found out and attacked him.
The fight was stopped, but my father did not believe me when I told him about my brother's actions.
I was made an exile, disowned by my home and people. I should not be here. They will not accept me back.
The slavers are still here... this dock is theirs. I doubt anyone has risen to try and fight. Nothing has changed.
I just hope I can prove myself to my people. It will be difficult to make them listen. I just don't know.
When I attacked my brother I was so mad... I used my claws. You don't understand what that means to a Wookiee.
Our claws are tools, not weapons. To use them in battle is to become an animal. It is madness without honor.
I am forever a madclaw in the eyes of my people. Nothing I say is to be trusted. They were right to cast me out.
I don't have much hope.
I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
He has been away a long time.
I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
What do you mean?
I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
What do you mean?
I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
What do you mean?
I decide who comes or stays on the ship.
What do you mean?
It's a little late for warnings, fur ball.
Prepared me? What do you mean?
I don't care, I'll learn what I need myself.
Why were you forced to leave?
That's enough. I'll learn the rest on my own.
Time has passed. Things will have changed.
Why didn't your father believe you?
We'll deal with that if we have to. Let's go.
Don't bother me. You're on your own here.
I'm not paid to talk. Take it to the captain or the stiffs in the office.
I just carry a blaster. The captain does the talking.
Talk to the captain, not me.
Still here? Why do you keep bothering me? All our services are up near the docking area.
Fine then, move along.
Make it quick. I'm no information booth. Talk to Janos in the Czerka office.
Hold here, spacer. Czerka Corporation doesn't recommend traveling in wild Edean. Katarn attacks are especially bad right now.
Wookiee hunters usually keep numbers down, but I think they leave certain areas infested, just hoping a Czerka guard will get killed.
I won't stop you, but you leave this area at your own risk. We're here to protect the company, not you.
Go to Janos for company policy. I just man the gate to make sure people like you know you're on your own on the other side.
I don't talk to Wookiee-lovers. Get rid of your rug and maybe I won't have you shot.
I don't take kindly to threats. Don't test me, spacer, we've more than enough firepower to bury you here.
That's right you will. Now get moving.
Make it quick. I'm getting tired of you.
[Success] Ah, you ain't so bad. Was there anything else you needed?
[Failure] What are you doing? Are you making fun of me? Don't push your luck, fool.
What's to tell? They're big, powerful, difficult, and worth the most when caged and shipped off this forest-covered rock.
You're not some anti-slaver, are you? If so, go talk your crud somewhere else. I've seen guards ripped to shreds. They're animals.
Watch yourself out there. There won't be any rescue missions if you go missing.
Not anymore. Look, you want to know why the Wookiees are acting compliant, you go ask them.
When they rip your head off, we'll fish it out of the Shadowlands and give it a proper burial. How about that?
Shipped as slaves to work as soldiers and heavy laborers in Czerka camps, no doubt.
That's horrible! You wouldn't talk like that if Big Z was here!
You're the Wookiee-lover, why don't you tell me about them? I'm sure you're real close friends.
Grraarrr!
Keep your pet on a leash or you'll be wearing him. I've no love for these animals. I've seen guards ripped to shreds.
Never mind. I'm leaving.
I have questions for you.
I'm going past you. I paid the landing fee.
Don't get in my way. You'll wind up dead.
What can you tell me about Czerka Corporation?
Maybe I should just let him rip your arms off.
Yes, yes, you're big and tough. I'll leave.
I meant nothing by it. Could you answer my questions?
Should I care? You are nothing to me.
[Force Persuade] You haven't warned me. I'm a nice person. You like me.
[Persuade] I'm just trying to get my bearings. I don't mean any harm.
What do you know about the Wookiees?
That's all. Goodbye.
So the Wookiees are fighting back?
You're probably here with the new restraining collars. I'm not handling another shipment without them.
Three restraining collars failed on the last shipment. The buyer was not pleased.
You'd think they'd be grateful to leave this barbaric place.
I wasn't aware we were giving tours now. Leave me.
Speak with the director if you need information. I only deal with volume buyers.
I don't have time to deal with you.
I don't deal with individual buyers. I'll have my broker contact your people.
Please leave me. I've contracts to decipher.
Hello again. Czerka Corporation is seeing a lot of return business these days. We are the only company offering Wookiees.
Welcome to Edean. I trust you will find our facilities pass inspection. Czerka Corporation is very efficient.
Please, take any inquiries you have to director Janos. I must continue my work.
Farewell.
I'm sorry, but director Janos will see to your questions. I must continue with my work.
I'm conducting experiments on various samples of indigenous plant life. There may be untapped pharmaceutical resources here.
Of course, that will take some time, and the Wookiees are a more immediate source of income. Please, I must return to my work.
There's no call for that. I'm just a glorified lab technician. Please, the assignment is difficult enough.
Take your concerns to Janos. He's the one that runs things here. Not me.
You have nothing to be proud of, fool.
I'm sorry, I don't understand Wookieespeak. Shyriiwook, I think it's called? What did the Wookiee say?
I didn't say that!
What are you doing? Stop this!
Call him off! I don't have anything to do with what happens on this planet. I'm just a glorified lab technician!
What was that about? I don't like being used for your amusement.
Grrr... I remember.
I don't have much hope of that.
I suppose so... but their presence here is no joke.
I'm not sure I can answer. Janos is the spokesman for Czerka Coporation at this outpost.
I just work here in the lab. I... I don't have anything to do with the taking of slaves.
I don't have to justify myself to you. I do good work here. If you're looking for trouble, go somewhere else.
I'm just an employee. You'll have to take your concerns to Janos. He's the voice for Czerka Corporation on this outpost.
Czerka Corporation calls the planet Edean, and no, I don't understand the language. The local Wookiee leader has made it so we don't need to.
Wookiees are unable to speak basic, but for the last decade the residents of all local villages have been trained to understand it.
I understand he works very closely with Czerka Corporation. He wants his people to work well with us. It eases tensions.
It helps ease tensions. They are less hostile towards us if they understand what we say.
And it makes my people more desirable as slaves.
What did he say? I don't usually have a translator I can ask.
Just leave me alone. I don't want any trouble. The guards are trigger-happy as it is.
I can't talk now. I've got to pack. They'll be on us soon!
Goodbye for now.
I want to ask questions about this planet.
I'm asking you. Answer my questions, peon!
What is your job here?
You'll talk as long as I say, understand?
He wants to rip your legs off and beat you with them.
See? He's furious. I can barely control him.
Don't question me. Remember your life debt.
I'm just scaring him. Maybe he'll learn something.
What? Don't you want these fools to fear you?
Ignore him. I have some questions for you.
He said you have nothing to be proud of working for Czerka.
Whatever you say. I have some questions.
How convenient. All the benefits with no guilt.
Why don't you do anything to stop it?
You work on Kashyyyk and don't understand the language?
Why would a Wookiee leader do that?
What good would that do?
That knowing Basic just makes his people better slaves.
Watch yourself. We don't need anyone agitating the locals.
Take a walk, spacer. You don't look like a big buyer to me.
If you've business with Czerka Corporation, take it to the director's office.
Keep walking. This ain't no holiday port of call.
Czerka Corporation should burn down some trees. Make room for some swoop races.
This assignment is the worst in the galaxy.
You want to arrange a purchase, go talk to the director in his office.
Move along, spacer.
I think you'd better talk to Eli directly. He's the boss... for the time being.
Greetings to you. Something I can get for you?
Kindly direct your inquiries to me. Matton is merely an indebted employee. His opinions don't amount to much.
That Thaylian bog-slime. Do you know that I have been here 36 days, slaving to pay a debt in good faith?
All for nothing. He killed my crew... who knows where my ship is. Well, there's your pay, Eli. Blaster fire, and keep the change.
Well, I could have shot out his legs and let him crawl around for a while, but I consider this far more merciful.
What did you expect I'd do? Besides, he'd have killed me. He couldn't have risked me telling everyone he was a cheat. He'd have no business.
Well, there's not much for me to do but stay here. I've no ship, so I may as well make a few credits.
I suppose it does, though maybe I should keep it up for a while on my own. I've no ship at the moment anyway.
It'll probably take a while to convince Eli's suppliers that I'm the new boss, but eventually I'll buy my way off this rock.
That's the idea. Actually, I should toss you a few credits for helping me out. Take them... maybe even spend them here.
What do you mean? I don't need to go hunting Eli's family or anything. I've seen justice done.
All right then. Here, I should toss you a few credits for helping. I appreciate what you did.
[Success] Working here when I was trapped was hell enough. Staying here now is just foolish. I don't want to be seen as weak.
[Failure] I'd rather move on, you know? I don't want to be mad about this for the rest of my life. I can make this work.
[Success] You know, maybe you're right. Why should I bother with this remote hole? This isn't the life I wanted.
I see your point. I'll leave his shop like his corpse. I'll take what I want, buy passage on a ship, and never look back except to spit.
Here, take this. Thanks for reminding me about how he misused my trust. I'll make sure it never happens again. With anyone.
Well, that's your opinion, I guess, but I still owe you for helping me. Here, take a few credits with you. Spend them here, if you like.
Safe flying to you. Hope to see you again.
All right then. Actually, I feel I owe you something. Here, take a few credits. If you spend it here, all the better. I think things are looking up.
Hello again. Welcom back to Eli Gand's outpost, now under new management. What do you need?
Right you are.
Thanks for your help, friend. I'm getting off this planet as soon as I can. I'll pay my own way, too. No more debts to anyone.
No more trusting anyone, either. I've learned what that gets you.
Did you have to kill him?
What will you do now?
I suppose that closes his little outpost here.
And you won't owe anyone a single credit. Good luck.
If it were me, I'd wipe out all memory of him.
Never mind. Goodbye.
Fine, fine. Just show me what's for sale.
[Force Persuade] Remember your hatred. Don't trap yourself here.
[Persuade] It's not enough. This store was his life. Let it rot.
Sounds like a boring choice to me. Goodbye.
In that case, let's see what's for sale.
I don't want anything right now, thanks.
You're still here? I'd never be so forgiving.
Let's see what you have for sale.
Hello again. What can I do for you, most valued customer?
Valued until you can't pay. Watch your credits.
You hurt me, Matton. It is the debt of your crew that keeps you here, not me.
So, new spacers have come to wild Kashyyyk? Please, look well upon the wares of Eli Gand. I live to serve your needs.
Just be sure to pay cash. The interest on his loans will drain you like a Deluvian fatworm on a Hutt's backside.
First off, Hutts are ALL backside. Secondly, I don't much like the comparison. No need to get personal. It's just business.
Poor fellow, he's been waiting for his friends to return with my money for a standard month now. Ah, but you don't need to hear of this. What can I get you?
See you soon, I hope. Always open.
We're always open... for now, at least.
Enslave? I resent that. Simply fair business. This man's fellows left without settling their debts, so he must make up the difference.
I know, I know, it's standard trading rules. I just want to know where my crew went. I was only gone for two days. This isn't like them.
Yes, very sad that they would abandon you, especially while you were doing me a favor and helping repair one of my freighters.
You think you know someone, and they turn out to be a cheat. Oh, not like you, Matton. You honor your deals. A word is a bond in trade.
Of course. I am here to serve.
Oh, it isn't about the amount. After all, as a skilled mechanic, Matton is worth much more than what is owed. Especially on this remote planet.
Oh, you flatter me, Eli. I guess we're best buddies now.
*ahem* As I was saying, it's a matter of principle. I am nothing if not honest in my dealings, and I demand the same.
He will be free to go when his friends turn up and the debt is paid. I honor my deals. Let no one say otherwise.
Thanks, but no thanks. No offense, but there's no point in exchanging debt to Eli with debt to you.
Besides, he is a hard worker. I'd prefer to keep him.
Ah, it happens from time to time. Credits are scarce out here, and not everyone is as honest as Mister Dasol here.
You'll get your money. My crew will be back.
Of course they will. Until then, however, I can make use of you as a mechanic. Very rare to find skills of your kind out here.
No, they're not. An honest man is pretty scarce, too, wouldn't you say?
An honest man and a good mechanic. Seems like you got a favorable trade, sir.
Something about this whole situation stinks worse than an overcrowded ronto stable! What kind of friends would just abandon a crew mate?
I don't concern myself with what goes on past this landing port. The Wookiees are *ahem*... very difficult to deal with. No business sense.
He means they don't tolerate cheats.
No, I mean they don't respect the finer points of a good business plan. Give and take. That is why the Czerka Corporation simply takes.
You'd have to take your questions to Czerka Corporation, and the Wookiees themselves. I keep to myself.
It is difficult indeed to deal with those you oppress and enslave.
No business sense? You mean they don't like to be cheated out of all their belongings and freedom.
You mean they don't tolerate cheats!
I know I'll be leaving soon. it's too unstable now. Maybe I could talk my way into dealing with the Wookiees, but it's risky.
Yeah, it turns out Wookiees don't want to be slaves. Like most people.
That's enough, Matton.
<< Enter text here >>
Of course. You are in a hurry.
Certainly, though my stock may be a little thin. I'm having trouble with a trade contact on Korriban.
Have a look, but if you see kolto, the price is not negotiable. My prices have risen like everywhere else.
Yes, maybe I have something of interest. I know your tastes are fine. I recognize you as race champion of Manaan.
Where? Ah, you mean the lower forest? I don't pay attention to what these Wookiees call it. A droid you say?
What... what kind of droid?
Now, now, Matton, it's likely just some old service droid lost by the Czerka Corporation. I wouldn't waste my time on it.
I really want to see this thing. This sounds very odd.
You get excited over hearsay. There is no droid, no proof of anything. Get back to work.
What? I'd really like to see this droid.
You startle my friend here needlessly. He has work to do and I won't have any more talk of this upsetting him. Understand?
I doubt it. I don't even want to look at it. I deal in trade of goods, not garbage.
Droid head? On Kashyyyk? Let me see that!
It is nothing, I'm certain. Eh... just garbage from the forest floor.
Mere rubbish? It's D-A02, the repair droid from my ship! What was this doing in the forest?
Eli, you snake! You said my crew jacked the ship without paying the repair bill!
Oh, there will be a reward, all right. Eli! You told me my crew jacked our ship without paying the repair bill!
Well... that is... eh... it's not how it looks. You see, a good mechanic is hard to find and...
And what? I thought I owed you! You tricked them into the Shadowlands and killed them all while I fixed your freighter in orbit!
Now keep your head, Matton. It was just business.
This is business? Maybe in Hutt Space, but not here! Not with me!
You outsiders even cheat each other! No wonder you give no thought to my people!
Whatever your Wookiee is saying, he's not helping diffuse the situation. This is just a simple business matter.
I've no business with you. I'll be going.
Do you always enslave your debtors?
I want to go back to my other questions.
How much debt buys a man's life?
Perhaps I could settle some of his debt?
Do your debtors have a habit of running off?
What do you know of Kashyyyk?
What do you mean by that?
Let me see what you carry.
I found a droid in the Shadowlands. Is it yours?
It recorded a very suspicious incident.
It had been damaged in some sort of ambush.
Could it be worth something?
I found this droid head. Can I ask you about it?
It recorded an ambush. Someone yells Eli's name.
What do I care? Is there a reward?
Greetings again. How can Czerka Corporation serve you during your visit to Edean?
I'm sorry, but I have no information on that. Are you sure you meant to come here? This world is very primitive.
Czerka Corporation has branches in many systems, mostly concerned with weapon production for personal and ship-mounted use.
Of course, the many outposts on this world are only concerned with bio-aquisitions.
G5-623 is the numerical designation. The galactic Basic name is "Edean," chosen by corporate ballot among stockholders.
At any rate, "Edean" is more pleasing than "Kashyyyk." The language of the dominant indigenous species is quite crude.
In fact, a translation droid must usually be placed with them, but their physical strength makes up for the inconvenience to the owner.
An endless array of dangerous creatures, it seems. The great trees harbor any number of dangers below.
We've detected odd energy signatures on occasion, but exploration is costly amongst creatures even more difficult than Wookiees.
We send expeditions, of course, but they come back with little, if they come back at all.
Odd energy signatures? Have you ever checked those out?
It would seem you are already acquainted with this world, given your choice of traveling companion.
I have been away for a very long time.
You let the beast speak for you? You allow it more liberties than most of our customers.
I've a very limited number of things I can say. What do you wish to discuss?
Very good, feel free to inspect our operation here, but I would advise against going too far from the main landing area.
The planet is still very much untamed, and we do not send out patrols for lost tourists.
Oh, just say the word!
It's not up to you. This planet is not a member of the Republic, and its backward citizens hold no rights.
I'm sorry you are offended, but this operation is very humane. Even the Wookiee leadership knows it is more beneficial to work with us.
Besides, even if you did do something drastic here, the Czerka Corporation has other outposts on Edean. It would change nothing.
Humane, you call it? Beneficial? Sounds like a bunch of excuses, if you ask me.
It's not our place to judge, Carth. As he said, it would change nothing anyway.
Are you saying you approve of this?!
Of course not. I would gladly end it, had I the power. However, we are here for other reasons, if you will recall.
Slavery under any guise should not be tolerated!
For material goods, I would suggest you speak with the general vendor near the docking area. He keeps his store well-stocked.
They charge fair value for mundane goods and armor. If it is weapons you want, you will need to deal with the Czerka representative. That would be me.
If you're here to purchase local species, however, you must wait for a licensed Czerka Corporation trader to return from deliveries outside the system.
Aren't you here to take delivery of a Wookiee thrall? There are few other reasons to visit this barbaric world.
We do things as humanely as possible. There are other outposts, but the operation is very lean overall.
He means that they are slavers. They take my people from their homes and sell them to the highest bidder.
Your current Wookiee seems displeased with the situation, but I fail to see a concern. You seem to be a satisfied customer.
It is not me, personally. I merely represent Czerka Corporation at this outpost. There are other directors at other stations, of course.
Arrangements have been made with the Wookiee leadership. Harvesting is handled as delicately as possible, relatively speaking.
Ah, a very difficult thing to stage. I commend you for it. So much easier than relying on restraining collars.
Do not demean the life-debt! Do not!
I must warn you that you will be blamed for the actions of your Wookiee. Please... call him off.
I am merely a servant of the corporation! The Wookiee leadership is in agreement! Harvesting is made as delicate as possible!
Please! It is not my decision! It is... an acceptable practice, I assure you!
I will answer if I can.
Now, there's no c-call for that. It is a simple matter, really. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.
We are kept profitable and an agreeable leader is kept in power. It keeps the process from becoming a constant firefight.
I believe his name is Chuundar. I don't deal directly with them, thank goodness. Far too brutish.
I don't know why you asked me these questions, but it doesn't matter. Chuundar is unquestioned as leader. Our operation is quite secure.
RrrrraaAAAARRRR!!!
[Success] I can tell you about the agreement. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.
[Failure] It's not good policy to talk about our corporate strategy. I'm sorry, but I can't say any more.
[Success] If it will ease your temper, I will give specifics. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.
Commentary: The meatbag speaks without clarity. Detail this agreement or the master will splatter your organs all over the floor!
Maybe you should start talking, or I might decide to get a little... restless.
[Force Persuade] You wish to tell us more about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.
[Force Persuade] You wish to tell us more about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.
[Force Persuade] Hmph. 'Harvesting'. Tell us about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.
Please, follow me to my office in our information center. We will discuss your needs and how Czerka Corporation can serve you.
I greet you again. Will you accept the terms of landing at this outpost? We are quite far from any similar services.
Greetings to you. Err... while I am pleased to welcome you to planet G5-623, I do not see your ship on my docking schedule.
The Czerka Corporation will see to your needs, of course, but there will be a 100 credit docking fee. In advance, I fear.
I respect your... obvious determination, but I can't allow you to remain unless you pay the proper fees.
The Czerka Corporation appreciates your cooperation, and hopes this will not devolve into a... violent matter.
W-we are not unarmed here! We have many guards and security droids. If we can control Wookiees, we can control you.
[Failure] I fail to see the basis for your arguement. Please, there is no need to be hostile.
This outpost is remote and expensive to maintain. The 100 credits given will ensure that it remains here... for your use, of course.
Upon collection of the correct fees, I will extend what resources the Czerka Corporation can offer. I'm sure you understand.
Very simply put, no. Operation of these remote outposts is an expensive endeavor.
[Success] Perhaps you don't need to pay the docking fee. Any services you need will more than make up for it.
[Failure] No... no I'm... quite certain that you need to pay the fee. It is a mere 100 credits, after all.
[Success] *sigh* Normally I wouldn't do this, but I don't feel like arguing. I'll consider a promise of future business payment enough.
Czerka Corporation protects its interests. If you won't pay, you won't be granted access to the planet and are free to leave.
I will await you here if you change your mind.
That is unfortunate. This outpost will have to remain closed to you until you can secure the credits. I am sorry. Good day.
You are welcome on Edean, trade designation G5-623. Czerka Corporation welcomes your business. We should discuss your interests in my office.
We will also arrange for translation services, for a nominal fee, of course. You'll be encountering a number of Wookiees while here.
I see you have a Wookiee with you. Can I assume you understand their language? For a fee, Czerka Corporation can provide a translator for you during your visit.
Er... very well. It is no concern of mine. I will simply assume you are one of the rare sort that take to languages easily.
Very well, though only the most adaptive people seem to comprehend the Wookiee language, such as it is.
I don't have any experience with that. I just know that only the most adaptive people can understand the Wookiee language.
Now then, please follow me to our information center. I will answer any further questions there.
Well, we are limited in many ways, but I doubt you will find even basic facilities anywhere else in this remote sector.
That is what the dominant indigenous species calls this world, but maintaining this outpost grants Czerka Corporation naming rights in the trade guides.
But, I'm sorry, I really must insist that docking fees be paid before I impart any further services. I must follow proper procedure.
Farewell for now.
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.
I'd like to ask about the Czerka Corporation.
Bio-acquisitions? What do you mean?
Tell me about the planet. You called it G5-623 before.
What else is on this planet?
What did you mean when you referred to a Wookiee's "owner?"
To the owner? What do you mean?
I'd like to talk about the slaving operations here on Edean.
I'm through speaking with you for now.
What's to stop me turning my Wookiee loose on you?
I can't allow this to continue.
Allow it more liberties? What do you mean?
I need supplies. What is available here?
Purchase local species? What do you mean?
I'd think you would need more firepower to keep order.
Disgusting slaver! Why shouldn't I kill you!
Why do the Wookiees tolerate you doing this?
Zaalbar is no slave. He has pledged a life-debt to me.
Why? I should let him kill the lot of you!
I've other questions to ask.
Tell me what you mean or I'll bloody your floor!
What is this leader's name?
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me about these agreements.
[Persuade] Tell me about it. I might be more understanding if I know.
Don't make demands. I'm <FullName>, and I'll land where I wish.
It's easily settled. I'll pay with your blood!
[Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the docking fee. Stand aside!
Docking fee? Why do I need to pay that?
Is the price negotiable?
[Force Persuade] I don't think I need to pay the docking fee.
[Persuade/Lie] I represent wealthy clients. You should let me pass.
I refuse to pay. What will you do about it?
I can't pay you the 100 credits.
Very well, I will pay the 100 credit fee.
I understand more than you can know.
That will not be necessary.
I'm trained in the Force. I'll have no trouble.
What services does 100 credits get me?
Could I get some information about the planet? I thought this was Kashyyyk.
Death to all slavers! Kashyyyk will be free!
The outsiders will pay for how they dishonored us!
At last, we will push them off our beloved Kashyyyk!
The Shadowlands are too good for them! We'll kill them all!
These Czerka animals will die by sword and bowcaster!
Let their blood feed out forests! That will be their payment!
Let no one escape! They must learn the price we place on dishonor!
Kashyyyk will be ours once more!
You are the only outsider that will survive us! We swear it!
Czerka will never come back here, we will make certain!
We will remember what happend here. Slavers will not take us again.
If another company comes to Kashyyyk, they will find it impossible to do what Czerka did.
It will be a long time before we allow ourselves to be as weak as Chuundar made us.
Your presence is tolerated because of how you helped us, outsider.
Thank you for your assistance, outsider. I doubt we will meet another of your kind like you.
We will guard this landing place from now on. Yours is the only ship that will be allowed to dock here for a long time, outsider.
Our work here could be very important if any effort was put into it.
Local fauna is amazing. If I could isolate why the trees grow so big, it would be worth more than a thousand Wookiee slaves.
I think Czerka is missing an opportunity here. The forest could teach us so much.
The payoff from research is too much of a risk for Czerka to spend much money on it. Slaves are proven commodities.
There is so much to learn about this planet, but they keep us cooped up in here.
I do my job and keep my mouth shut. Maybe I can do some good if I stay out of people's way.
Don't bother me, now. I've got twice as many Wookiees to process as usual.
Hey! Don't get too close to the cages. Even these cowed Wookiees will take your arm off if they get the chance.
Heh, if we keep exporting at this rate, the only planet in the sector with no Wookiees will be their home world.
You know, I hear Czerka has negotiated to increase its presence here by six more outposts.
I heard the Wookiee leader is saying we can increase the number of slaves we take. I think Czerka will be here a long time.
I hear the Wookiees seem to be cooperating even more than usual now. Czerka can pretty much do whatever it wants.
Hey, business is better than ever. These animals will pay our way for years.
Hey, we just got word that shipments will be increasing. This Chuundar really knows how to do business.
You know, every Czerka outpost is expected to double the number of Wookiees they take in the next year.
Wookiees settle down a lot once they're caged.
It took ten days for news of Taris to reach me. They don't tell us anything.
I guess I should be grateful I'm on Kashyyyk. I could have been posted to Taris.
All those people on Taris dead. First I heard the whole planet was gone, but even just the city is sad.
Have you heard where the Sith might be headed next? I don't even know why they targetted Taris.
We get the occasional private trader from Korriban through here, but not recently. I wonder what's up.
Have you been by Korriban recently? The Sith there aren't planning on taking their trouble off-world, are they?
I heard something about trouble with Sith on Korriban, but as long as no cities are being destroyed, they can do what they like.
I don't mind being on a backwater planet when I hear about the trouble places like Korriban get.
You look a lot like the winner of the Manaan races. I bet that opens door for you.
I heard some rookie took the big prize at the Manaan swoop races. I guess anyone can win now that Taris is gone.
Is your ship equipped to get the major planetary broadcasts? I heard the Manaan races were pretty good.
Are you... no, there's no way a swoop champion is on Kashyyyk. No way.
If we don't get another shipment of kolto, we'll have to start using local herbs for healing. Then we'll hurt *and* stink.
Bring those Selkath here see if they think we need kolto. They'd start shipping it out quick, I bet.
This planet is the worst assignment to have with a kolto shortage coming up.
Czerka is making us put a deposit on standard issue kolto packs. I know the cost has gone up, but come on.
Another time, human. I wish you well on this world.
Greetings again to you, human. It would seem the call of the hunt has brought us both to this troubled world.
I have not been here long, but I can already see I will not be as welcome here as I had hoped.
It was a hard decision, but I felt I had no other choice. I had done a disservice to the apex predator of that world. It was time to go.
While I'm sure you would prove an interesting hunt, I don't track sentient prey. Two-legged animals do a fine job of killing each other without me.
I have come here to seek even greater prey than what we faced on Tatooine, but the climate here is politically cold, and I don't know if I will be allowed to hunt.
Farewell. Perhaps we will meet again. A great hunt on this world would be glorious.
I know that I don't know enough. Even from this docking area I can see this world is a true wonder. My desert-dimmed imagination didn't do it justice.
It's just a shame to see Czerka Corporation here. They lack an appreciation for the wild nature of this world. I don't like having to deal with them.
The native leadership of the Wookiees, of course. This is their world, after all. I can't understand why thy have allowed it to be misused.
There is always the option to fight, even if there is no option to win. Of course, that is easy for me to say, being an outsider.
I would hope they are not complicit in the enslaving of their world, but it is not my place to judge. I have only just arrived.
Perhaps they had no choice.
No, but I wasn't listening for such talk. I'm sorry that I can't help you.
An astute question. Czerka Corporation seems in control here, but they don't care if I wander the Shadowlands, so long as I have paid their docking fee.
Instead, I hope to gain the trust of the native Wookiee population. I'm not here to just kill the biggest thing I can find; I want to understand how they hunt.
Very little. I'm sure they have had enough of off-worlders like the Czerka claiming good intentions. I will simply try to stay out of their way.
I have heard of an off-worlder that has gained respect by living in the Shadowlands for some years. Perhaps I will attempt the same. It could just be hunter tales, though.
Why did you leave your home on Tatooine?
What are you doing here, Komad? Following me?
I have to leave. Goodbye.
What do you know of Kashyyyk?
If not Czerka, who would you prefer to deal with?
I'm looking for a Star Map here. Have you heard anything?
Whose permission are you looking for?
What are you doing to gain their trust?

Kashyyyk - The Great Walkway
I never thought I'd see the big trees. Zaalbar's stories didn't do it justice. This is incredible.
I wish he was here to see this. He'd want to see this, you know?
Can you sense it? The wind... the sound... the smells? I feel it all now that we are away from the spaceport.
This walkway is new, probably built by the slavers, but I remember the trees. My village is not far from here.
Yes, your outsider concerns must always come first. Just remember that this was my home. You are the stranger here.
I must warn you of one thing... I don't know if I will be a help or hindrance to you here. My father was very powerful... a chieftain.
Perhaps his feelings have mellowed, but if my brother had his ear all this time... I may be very unwelcome.
I'm not asking you to deal with anything. I just wanted you to know about potential problems.
Bah, do what you want with this information. I won't say any more about it.
That is what I am dreading. My shame was meant to be forgotten on some far away world. I never thought I'd come back.
I'm sorry, I've taken enough of your time. We should press on.
It is kind of you to offer, but my problems are very personal. I'm not sure if I am ready to deal with them.
I'm sorry, I don't know. It has been so long since I left. I only know the way things were, and many things may have changed.
We're here for the Star Map. Nothing else, understand?
I don't have time for your family squabbles.
We'll deal with that when the time comes.
Is there anything I can help you with?
What can I expect to encounter?
Why do you bother us again, outsider? We have nothing to say to you.
What do you want, outsider? I won't let you follow us on our hunt. Chorrawl is not here for your amusement.
Feh! I'll believe that when our planet is free of you. Your kind are here only to take or destroy.
Why would you listen to me? Your kind have only been interested in caging or killing us.
You can't push me into battle, outsider. I know what happens to Wookiees that are said to be "difficult."
I won't be your trophy, dead or as a slave. Leave me. You have no place here.
You do that. Walk quickly, outsider. Kashyyyk fights back, even if we can't.
Your kind threaten my very planet. I live with it daily. Why should your words now goad me into battle?
No, I won't fight you. At best, my warrior comrades would slaughter you, only for ships to burn our homes later.
Go away, rabid fool. I won't listen to you anymore.
[Success] I... I should answer your questions... yes, perhaps one or two.
[Failure] You Czerka slavers, caring about nothing except what you want... what you can take!
You disgust me. Your scent poisons the air. Your feet foul the ground. Go away, outsider. Go away.
[Success] Hmm... only a moment, outsider. I won't be this patient for long.
Yes, go, and don't expect a friendly welcome if you return. This world is my home, not yours.
I don't concern myself with outsider toys. Search where you will, I'm not wasting my time.
You taunt me with a foolish question like that. How do you think? My people go missing or die.
We can't fight back. Chuundar has bartered to reduce the slaves taken, but if any Czerka die, it increases again.
How has my world fared? It is slowly dying.
Big Z once told me he had seen paradise destroyed by the greed of outsiders. I never understood what he meant until now.
Why do you not do something about this tyranny, then?
Why not do something about it, then?
He is our Chieftain and will be obeyed. That is our way. Whether I trust what he says or not doesn't matter.
In time, someone will replace him. For better or worse, I don't know. That will be for Bacca to decide.
Bacca was our greatest warrior. His ancient sword is the tool of ascension, the mark of a chieftain.
Chuundar no longer displays it, not since he took the role of chieftain years ago. If someone else could produce it...
Bah! I talk like a mere child! This is foolishness.
It truly would take Bacca's Blade for that to happen. Chuundar is the last member of his family.
There were others, but they were marked with madness. We don't speak their names. They are without honor.
The only crazed creature I know of is one of your kind, outsider, not mine. We see him from time to time.
We leave him alone. He has our respect because he has braved the lands alone. Sometimes he helps lone travelers. He is crazy, though.
Our finest warriors hunt the Shadowlands in groups, yet he lives there alone. Avoid him. Madness is to be feared.
Many years. It is impossible to know how many. A decade? Two? Perhaps he can answer your questions. Or kill you.
Hmph! I merely have an appreciation for solitude.
Ha! You claim to be a legend, but I'd know the mad hermit if I saw him. 3-meters tall, with eyes of madness.
Chuundar! Bah! Why should I care if you act for him when he does not act for us?
Hold your tongue. You speak of the Chieftain.
Yes, you would say that. You have lost no one to slavers. Chuundar has bought you.
No, not to you. You are an outsider and only care about our weaknesses. I won't say anything to you.
I am done with you, outsider. Go away. I won't be your entertainment.
I don't mean you any harm.
Could I ask some questions?
Don't test me, Wookiee. I go where I wish.
I will leave you then.
Show me proper respect or you'll regret it!
[Force Persuade] I want you to answer my questions.
[Persuade] Just a few questions. I'm a friend.
I will leave you now.
I seek an ancient Star Map. Have you seen it?
How has Kashyyyk fared under the Czerka Corporation?
What do you think of Chuundar?
How will Bacca decide? What does that mean?
Could a blood relative of Chuundar challenge him?
Do you know of a crazed Wookiee in the Shadowlands?
How long has he been down there?
I am <FullName>, and I act for Chuundar.
Explain what you meant by that.
Well, it seems you are more than I thought. Freyyr has come back, and told me of what you did for him.
My fellow hunters split on what should be done. Some were loyal to Chuundar alone... we had to fight.
Freyyr went to the throne room to challenge Chuundar. I will take you to him now.
Yes, much is about to be decided. Only one can lead us. *Must* lead us. Come.
We follow the Chieftain, whoever that is. If the position is in doubt, we each fight for the side we believe in.
This must be decided quickly or there will be much more bloodshed. Come, it is this way.
I can guide you off the path. We will approach from behind, avoiding Czerka and those loyal to Chuundar.
It is the only way. I'm sorry, but I won't allow you to proceed any other way. This is too important.
Lead on. We should hurry.
You fought each other? Why?
Why should I follow you?
You want to talk, do it with Patrol Captain Dehno. He's the ranking officer in this unit.
We should just say it bolted, or something.
They won't miss one, will they?
Why do they always have to be so difficult?
Well, this means extra duty for sure.
I thought he said shoot. I swear he said shoot.
You know, we're gonna get stuck with the bill for this.
The patrol Captain will speak for us. He's the ranking officer in this unit.
Wow. This is going to look really bad on my record.
What are you doing back here? Look, you got what you wanted, so just let us get back to corralling these animals.
What is it now? If you don't mind, I have important matters to discuss with my patrol.
This isn't good. I can't afford this.
You think I can? Do you know what they get for a healthy one of these things?
We'll work it out later. We've got company.
What do you want, spacer? I'm Patrol Captain Dehno and you're interrupting Czerka Corporation business.
Good. Watch yourself. These old paths are dangerous.
You mean Edean? Backwater world.
There are a few patrols in the lower areas, but I haven't heard what they are after.
The company has branches on many planets. I'm just a Patrol Captain. It's not my job to monitor it all.
If you want quotes on policy, get someone else. I just escort the slaves and guard this area.
This Wookiee slave got a little... rebellious. We had to put it down.
That's right! We had to do it and it shouldn't come out of our pay.
Just shut up, you trigger-happy idiot.
No, of course they don't. Why would you ask me that? Are you doing some sort of snap inspection?
You're trying to get me to admit to incompetence, aren't you? Not going to happen. I stand by my patrol.
This Wookiee got out of hand and *had* to be put down. We'll find another easy enough.
Well... all right then. Carry on. We've work to do here.
Thanks for taking care of that, Captain.
You shut up. I'm not done with you two.
Is that a joke? Who do you think you are?
[Success] I... I think I should pull in some favors and... get us moved off-world, men.
Uh, are you all right, Captain?
Are you questioning my orders? You don't want to do that.
[Success] You make some sense. I wonder, what do you know about what might happen here?
Men, I think we should petition for a transfer. The corporation will survive a fight here, but us frontline guards won't.
If... you say so, Captain.
Yes, I say so. Move out. This place just isn't worth the trouble.
What the...? Blasters ready, men! This fool wants to die!
It... is a bit costly. Look, why are you asking this?
[Success] I... I think I should probably pay you so this stays off my record. Yes, that's best.
Uh, Captain.... what's going on? Is this one of those inspector shake-downs?
[Failure] What are you trying to get away with here? You can't just walk up and start demanding things.
I think this troublemaker needs an accident. In fact, I think this Wookiee attacked this fool and we arrived just a little too late to help.
Uh, Captain, we have blasters. Don't Wookiees use those bowcaster things?
Would you just shut up and shoot?
And who are you to stop us, little man?
[Success] What... you're a Czerka inspector, aren't you! Slimy little... I've heard about these shake-downs.
Give it up, men. If we don't pay this leech we'll get a black mark on our records a sunspot couldn't burn off.
But I, I... if you say so, sir. I don't think we have enough... here.
You are making this difficult. You know, maybe it's too much trouble to pay you. Maybe there's a better way.
Yes, I'm sure it will be. If I see anything on our records I'll have you fed to a katarn. In bite-sized chunks.
Now, if you don't mind, we have a patrol to get back to.
You lied to gain profit from the death of this Wookiee? You may as well have killed him yourself.
So I see.
Uh, if we're done here, we have a patrol to get back to.
You can't justify this. Don't try.
Put it down? You killed him, you mean.
Put it down? You... you murdered him?
You murdered him!
You "put *it* down"? We're not animals!
Careful now... that growl sounded pretty threatening. Keep your slave on its leash or we'll have another accident.
I'm leaving. Never mind.
I have questions about Kashyyyk.
Tell me about Czerka Corp.
My name is <FullName>. What happened here?
Do your superiors approve of you killing Wookiees?
I don't actually care, one way or another.
I won't allow you to enslave or kill another Wookiee.
[Force Persuade] Request a transfer. Move your patrol off-world.
[Persuade] This posting is trouble, friend. Get out while you can.
It doesn't matter. I'll end your miserable life where you stand!
This may cost you more than you know, fool.
[Force Persuade] You want to pay me so this stays off your record.
[Persuade/Lie] You know why. Hand over compensation or this gets reported.
I'll just take it from your corpse then!
I demand more!
That will be fine. Thank you.
Shut up. I do as I wish.
I can't change what they did. Why not profit?

Greetings again, outsider. I will transport you to the Shadowlands if you wish. Chuundar wills it.
Rrrgh. Chuundar has commanded that I grant you access to the Shadowlands. Gorwooken is what I am called.
Walk with care! Only our bravest return from these lands. Your soft feet are a barely tolerated insult.
I will wait. Chuundar bids it.
The descent is long. Be still, or we will attract... unwelcome visitors.
Chuundar said nothing of answering your questions. Be brief.
A few like you are in the Shadowlands, given premission by Chuundar. I don't know why. Only Wookiees should be allowed.
The journeys of my people are very personal. I won't speak of them to an outsider.
You can't. You must live here to understand, to see harmony in the danger. Bah, I waste my breath on you.
[Failure] Eughh... my head hurts... hurry up and be on your way, outsider.
[Success] Ergh... I should tell you about some of us that have gone to the Shadowlands. There have been many...
Latest was Rorworr, and he has not returned in many days. He may have died below, but he was strong and able.
Many have died recently. Chuundar believes one of our own is below, mad, crazed, killing all. I do not know.
We find no bodies to examine. The Shadowlands claim them, I am sure.
[Failure] This isn't for you to know. I'm done talking about it.
[Success] You ask very respectfully. Outsiders never do that. I suppose I can mention some of us that have entered the Shadowlands.
For reasons I do not know, Chuundar allows those of the Czerka to move in the Shadowlands. They kill much.
And there is another, but he has earned respect. He does not disturb our lives or customs. And he gets angry like a Wookiee sometimes.
Urgh... his name hurts my tongue. He has lived alone in the Shadowlands for many years now.
Be brief. I am not your guide.
That would be me. Jolee Bindo. Do I really look so different up close?
No, it cannot be you. You are too frail and old. The other is mad like a crazed tach.
Those that walk the Shadowlands do so at their own risk. It is a test of bravery among my people. A respected feat.
But you come here like the Czerka, with strange weapons. It is so much more than we have, yet you still fear?
You are pathetic. You will get no warnings from me. Prove your worth, to us and to yourself.
They have made Chuundar strong, so we are all stronger, but I do not like them. They are small and hide behind armor.
They would not survive the Shadowlands as a true Wookiee. They are not worthy to be there, but Chuundar wills it.
I'm not ready yet. I'll go down later.
Just unlock the thing and lower me down.
I have a few questions, Gorwooken.
Has anyone else been allowed down recently?
I want to understand why Wookiees revere the Shadowlands.
[Force Persuade] Tell me about any Wookiees that have recently gone this way.
[Persuade] Tell me of the Wookiees so I might show proper respect.
What outsiders are below?
Back to my other questions now.
I want to ask if it's dangerous down there.
What do you think of the Czerka Corporation?
[Having seen Gorwooken use the basket, you understand it well-enough to operate it.]
[You leave the basket as it is.]
[The basket begins to descend into the darkness.]
[I don't need this right now.]
[Go down to the Shadowlands.]
Speak with Chorrawl if you must speak at all. He knows your jagged language best.
Death to all slavers! Kashyyyk will be free!
The outsiders will pay for how they dishonored us!
At last, we will push them off our beloved Kashyyyk!
The Shadowlands are too good for them! We'll kill them all!
These Czerka animals will die by sword and bowcaster!
Let their blood feed out forests! That will be their payment!
Let no one escape! They must learn the price we place on dishonor!
Kashyyyk will be ours once more!
You are the only outsider that will survive us! We swear it!
Czerka will never come back here, we will make certain!
Grrrowwlll!! You are not permitted to pass into the Shadowlands. Only Chuundar may allow you entry.
Speak with Chuundar in the village of Rwookrrorro. He will decide if you are worthy.
Chuundar has said you may pass into the Shadowlands. Gorwooken will lower you down in the elevator basket.
Gorwooken climbed to the basket from the upper branches, but you will have to walk, outsider.
The path is seldom used. There may be vermin nesting along it. Be ready to fight.
By order of Chieftain Freyyr, you are allowed full access to the Shadowlands and our village. You have our thanks, outsider.
Chuundar has said that you can remain here, but watch where you step while in our village, outsider.
Freyyr has returned to us because of you, outsider. You are one of the few outsiders we will allow to remain among us in the village.
GRRROWLLL, stop where you are, outsider. You enter the domain of Chuundar, Chieftain and leader!
He will decide if you are fit to walk the village of Rwookrrorro. You've already soiled our world with what you brought on your ship.
Look about you, fool. You face a legion of Wookiees in their home terrain! It is a losing fight for you.
You will be taken before Chuundar and he will judge your worth, and punishment for the taint you have returned to us.
He is right. There are too many. Please, let us go to Chuundar. He has much to explain.
The choice is made for you already! You make a demand for something you can't alter, can't help!
Chuundar sent us to search it. We found the exile. The nameless mad-claw, once called Zaalbar.
He means me. I am the taint that you have brought back.
Shut up! GROWWLL! You are nameless with dishonor, mad-claw! Yours is a foulness that disgusts me!
Stand aside! This human is with me and I want access to the home of my people!
You have no rights here, mad-claw! This human should not have brought this taint upon our land! You must answer to Chuundar!
There is no refusing. If you will not walk, we will bind you. Shall you be carried through the trees like a child?
RRaaaghh! Enough! The mad-claw from your ship is already before Chuundar. Come!
RRaaaghh! Enough talk! You and the outcast mad-claw will be taken to Chuundar now!
You will not take me anywhere, mongrel!
Take me to Chuundar. I would speak with him.
My ship? What do you mean by that?
Who gave you access? You had no right!
And if I refuse to go see Chuundar?
What does he mean, Zaalbar? What taint?

Kashyyyk - Village of Rwookrrorro
Why do you bother me, human? I don't wish to speak with you.
Leave me, human outsider. I do not wish to speak with you.
Why? So you can better exploit us? Why should I speak with you?
Please, do not bother me again.
You have a Wookiee marked by exile as a slave. If he is your property, he is no Wookiee. Not until he kills you.
I will speak with you a moment, but do not pretend to be a friend. I trust only the word of Chuundar.
I am not a slave. I have made a life debt.
To an outsider? You truly are a mad-claw. Don't taint my ears with your ravings. I'll speak to your owner, not you.
I shall believe that when I see it. I will speak with you, but do not mistake that for trust.
We are threatened everyday. You are just another body in the army we face from all sides, at all times.
No, I will not fear you. Ask what you will, but save your threats. I am numb to them.
I am ashamed that he would ask outsiders to track such a creature. Why couldn't our own hunters remove his dishonor?
If you must be the one, then so be it. Be merciful and quick. A Wookiee without the honor of self-control is a mere animal.
And when you are through, do the same to your slave Zaalbar. His taint is a curse upon us too. Bah, I will speak no more of him.
I don't know about anything like that, but I don't understand you body-bald fools. You are all slavers or crazy.
Our hunters say one of you has been living in the Shadowlands, and that is crazy! I don't know how he survives.
It's probably just hunter-tales, though. No one could live in the Shadowlands for the years he has. No one.
Maybe insanity makes you taste bad. I don't know. You tell me.
We go for ritual, to prove ourselves. Some exiles are forced to live there. What other choice do they have? Slavery?
I know of none. I do not enter the Shadowlands. I only hear stories. Nobody really believes them.
Well, a gifted few, perhaps.
Another of our people is missing. If the slavers were responsible, more would have disappeared. This was just one Wookiee.
It may be that he died in the Shadowlands. If he did, there is honor in that, and he will be mourned.
His friends Woorwill and Jaarak will want to know. If it was not natural, Worrroznor must be told. He is the Holder of the Laws.
Woorwill's home is on the central tree of the village. Worrroznor maintains court on the platform just to the east of there.
What makes it your business? Bah, I have nothing to say. Speak with his friends, if you must.
Woorwill and Jaarak maintain a vigil in Woorwil's home on the central platform on the village.
The body of Rorworr was found. He was a promising warrior. We will mourn him fiercely.
This is no secret to you. For whatever reason, you made certain justice was merciful in this matter.
I still do not trust you, but you have a small measure of thanks for this.
You know this. You made certain his killer was executed. Was it for justice, or just the payment you recieved?
Go on, mercenary, leave me alone. I haven't the money to pay for your loyalty.
What right do you have to question Chuundar? What could you possibly know about us?
Be brief. I tire of this.
Primitive? Our traditions are ancient! There is great order and honor in how we live! Even with our... troubles.
Your interest is surprising. I had not thought an outsider would care. Still, I shouldn't talk of our troubles.
Chuundar is our leader, and deserving of respect. Even with our doubts.
I would not believe you. You are an outsider. You lie. You cheat. You enslave us. There is nothing you could say to make me believe.
[Failure] No, no I don't. You see, your kind are all mad. You don't understand a thing said to you.
[Success] I should tell someone... we whisper it anyway. Everyone wonders about it.
Chuundar has done much. He keeps the slavers from the village, and rules fairly. He keeps order, and keeps us strong.
But... his father was better. Freyyr the Chieftain would not have allowed the slaver docking platforms to be built. That's why he was killed.
Soon after the mad son Zaalbar was sent away. Freyyr seemed to succumb to the same kind of insanity.
It is thought that he died fighting slavers. I like to think so. Chuundar has bravely risen to lead us, despite his troubles.
I don't want to think about this. You test my patience, outsider.
There is no one left that is willing to stand up to the slavers. We wait for the coming of Bacca's heir.
The ancient Bacca was our greatest leader. At his death, he swore that his spirit would live in our true chieftains.
His sword would be the sign, and legends say we have always prospered under those that held it. No longer.
No one has seen the blade for years. It is a foolish hope. We now follow Chuundar. He is sane and honorable.
There is no one. Chuundar is unquestioned. You have seen to that, have you not? Speak no more of it.
You see the dignity of my people? We will overcome.
Don't speak for me, mad-claw. You left in shame. Time has not changed that.
Threatening her may not get you the results you want.
Surely that is no way to gain co-operation from the Wookiees. Some subtlety is not out of the question, is it?
Freyyr is returned to us! The madness of Chuundar will be undone. It is a great day, and I'm told it is becasue of you, <FullName>.
What can I do for you?
And we are glad you did. Thank you. We will be strong again.
You taint yourself with your words. You are a friend to us. Don't ruin it with your crazy outsider ways.
I will answer if I can.
Goodbye then. Thank you.
I don't know about that. You outsiders from away are always looking for strange things. It makes you crazy.
Maybe you should search for that fool living in the Shadowlands. Our hunters say they see him from time to time and sometimes he helps them.
I don't know how he stays alive. Maybe animals won't eat crazy-meat. I don't know.
Madam, I am not a fool. I survive because I am careful.
See, you are all crazy. You can't be him. The hunters say he is a great warrior and fearsome.
Rorworr is missing. He's one of our most promising warriors. I still hope he will be found alive, but no one knows where he is.
His friends Woorwill and Jaarak would like to hear any news. They are in Jaarak's home on the central village tree platfom.
If there was a crime, tell Worrroznor, Holder of the Laws. His home is east of the central village tree.
Woorwill and Jaarak are his friends. You could speak with them. They are in Jaarak's home on the central village tree platform.
Rorworr was missing, but you know that. You caught his killer and showed that justice can be merciful.
Rorworr was missing, but you know that. You caught his killer and made sure he was executed.
I am grateful you have kept order, but the whole matter makes me sad.
And you, Zaalbar, you fought for us even when shunned. All of Rwookrrorro is grateful, and also shamed for the way you were treated.
I am proud of today. Yesterday is forgotten.
I will leave you. Goodbye.
I go where I wish. Will you stop me?
I want to ask you some questions.
Goodbye.
I travel with a Wookiee. I am a friend.
I am not your enemy. I serve the greater good.
Because I demand it! Do not anger me!
Chuundar wants me to find an insane Wookiee in the Shadowlands.
I seek something called a Star Map.
Why do you say we're crazy?
If the Shadowlands are so dangerous, why go?
What exiles live there now?
Any recent trouble other than the slavers?
Who should I talk to if I have information about his disappearance?
Who would know more?
Why do your leaders allow slavers to take your people?
Then I will ask about other things.
I don't give you much thought. You are primitives.
Tell me so I might understand.
What if I told you Chuundar is in league with the slavers?
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me your doubts about Chuundar.
When did Freyyr die?
Who would you rather have as leader?
What do you mean by that? Explain.
I want to go back to my previous questions.
I'm glad I could help.
It was like managing foolish children.
I need to ask you some questions.
Farewell.
I'm looking for a Star Map.
Are there local concerns besides the slavers?
Who do I talk to if I know about this?
Who could I talk to about that?
You are not permitted to enter the rest of Rwookrrorro. Our children live in the upper boughs. You will not disturb them.
You couldn't make the climb anyway. Only a Wookiee has the skill to navigate the wroshyr trees.
I long for the Kashyyyk of old. We had no need of footpaths for outsiders like you.
Rorworr has shamed us when we needed strength. His death will serve as a lesson in the importance of honor.
Your actions are unexpected. Very few outsiders have shown mercy during their stay here.
Jaarak has shamed us. To strike down one of our own... he showed the gall of an outsider.
I do not like that you have seen us at our worst. Jaarak has lost his honor to an outsider.
Do you miss your kin when they are taken from you, outsider? I doubt you feel the same as we do.
Rorworr has not returned to the village. If you took him, outsider, you will pay dearly.
Rorworr was mentor to some of our most promising children. We need his spirit in these dark times.
Rorworr is the latest of us to go missing. I hope your outsider slavers lost many men trying to cage him.
Freyyr will not let slavers take us. Of that, I am certain.
Kashyyyk will rise to repel the slaver threat. Freyyr will see to it.
It is right that Chuundar died. He was tainted by outsider greed.
Freyyr will not let us fall to slavers. He would rather die.
First there was one outsider, then many, and now you walk our village! It's too much!
Chuundar allows you to be here, outsider. You would be dead if he didn't.
Chuundar has grown comfortable dealing with you outsiders. I have not.
I will not speak with you, outsider. You are not worthy.
I am not accustomed to speaking with you outsiders. Some have gotten too comfortable with it, I think.
The shame of Rorworr's actions will haunt us. Justice was properly merciful with his killer.
You surprise me with your mercy, outsider. I wouldn't have thought it possible.
Jaarak's fate would be easier to stomach if an outsider had not profited from it.
Even when serving justice, you outsiders find a way to profit. Leave me alone, mercenary.
Bacca's Blade keep Rorworr safe and Bacca's wisdom guide him home to us.
We lose more of our most promising warriors everyday.
Many are talking of Rorworr's disappearance. It is hardest on the young.
Rorworr has not returned to the village in days. If slavers took him, they had a fight on their hands.
Freyyr has been through much. His wrath will make us strong.
The honor of Kashyyyk is tainted. Only slaver blood will make things right.
Chuundar deserved death. He made us fearful and weak.
Freyyr is back in power! Slavers will learn to fear us now!
It was not long ago that Kashyyyk had no outsider taint.
You will never take me as a slave, outsider. By Bacca's Blade, you will not!
Chuundar may tolerate you, but do not expect the same from all of us.
