<i> 1x08 - Field Trip </i>

2
00:00:59,269 --> 00:00:59,738
Report.

3
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,225
All sensors
are in the green, sir.

4
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:02,376
The building is secure.

5
00:01:02,745 --> 00:01:04,181
I've heard that before,
mr. O'Brien.

6
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:05,800
Understood, sir.

7
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:07,039
Oh, and sir,

8
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,727
Your daughter
is here to see you.

9
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:10,558
Wonderful.

10
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:19,116
The old man
wants us on full alert, 24/7.

11
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:21,079
Report everything.

12
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:31,365
[whirring]

13
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:42,700
I'm in.

14
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,359
still no alerts showing up
on their systems.

15
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:56,403
You invented invisible armor,
Tony.

16
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:58,018
Think about that.

17
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,395
Your dad would be
so jealous.

18
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,668
he'd just come up with
something better.

19
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:05,921
This place used to be
my home.

20
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:08,297
Now I have to break into it.

21
00:02:09,938 --> 00:02:11,083
[clanking footsteps]

22
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,183
When I was little,
I always wanted

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,683
To come down here
to my dad's vault

24
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:18,459
To see all of his inventions.

25
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,504
[static crackles]

26
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:23,998
It was the good stuff,

27
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,929
The stuff he couldn't
get to work

28
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,302
Or just never finished.

29
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:28,294
But now I'm scared
to look inside.

30
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:34,387
hey, you don't know
that Stane took it, Tony.

31
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,685
The living laser equipment,

32
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,657
It could have
gotten out there before.

33
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,645
no.

34
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:41,323
Stane took it.

35
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,943
Oh, man.
Stane's got everything.

36
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,643
then we'll get it back,

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,337
Because you've got something
he doesn't:

38
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,328
The iron man armor, right?

39
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:55,554
yeah.

40
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,713
Yeah, you're right.

41
00:02:57,393 --> 00:02:58,264
I've got--huh?

42
00:02:58,658 --> 00:02:59,293
[scattered beeping]

43
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:00,572
warning.

44
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,135
System failure
in progress.

45
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:04,132
All functions in shutdown mode.

46
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:07,633
[faltering beeping]

47
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,854
[tense music]

48
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,652
Tony?

49
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:23,719
Tony!

50
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:25,300
yeah, I'm here.

51
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:27,830
Tony, what happened?

52
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:33,426
the armor, it went, you know,
dead.

53
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:34,630
it went dead?

54
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:36,076
What did Stane do?

55
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:37,620
no, it wasn't Stane.

56
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:39,330
The power cells
are totally empty.

57
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,662
The stealth tech
must have fried them.

58
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:41,896
Whoops.

59
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,426
what are we gonna do?

60
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,589
There's no way you could carry
that armor out of the building,

61
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:47,296
And when Stane finds it--

62
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,838
relax, mr. Panicky.

63
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,273
This is no problem.

64
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,675
I'll just sneak
out of the building,

65
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,828
Grab some new power cells,

66
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:53,863
Sneak back in,
and get the armor.

67
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,420
Hmm, now that I said that
out loud,

68
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:57,989
I think maybe we are in trouble.

69
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:05,721
[slinky music]

70
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:17,026
okay, without the armor
to jam the cameras,

71
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:18,774
I'll have to do this fast.

72
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,504
When it's clear,
I'll jump into the elevator.

73
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,801
oh, you mean the elevator
that will set off an alarm

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,002
Without your armor to jam it.

75
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:24,865
[sighs]

76
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:27,790
So when it's clear,
I'll head up the stairs.

77
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:29,446
oh, what's happening?

78
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:31,257
don't worry.

79
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,330
I know this building like
the back of my hand.

80
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:34,914
There's no way I'm gonna get...

81
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:39,295
Caught.

82
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:47,221
whitney,
I do not have time for this.

83
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:48,842
you never have time!

84
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:51,688
I am dealing
with a major security breach,

85
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,815
And now you want to see me?

86
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:00,340
You?

87
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:01,376
Tony?

88
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,962
Tony!
Hi!

89
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:05,171
whitney?

90
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,491
I haven't see you
in, like, months.

91
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:07,802
Where have you been?

92
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,982
I heard
you're going to school now.

93
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:10,350
Why haven't you called?

94
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:11,285
[laughs nervously]

95
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,367
Sorry, whitney.

96
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:13,777
It's been a little crazy.

97
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:16,601
well, I'm sure you'll
find a way to make it up to me.

98
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:19,620
Maybe when you're done here,
we can--

99
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:23,130
whitney,
get out right now.

100
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,593
no!

101
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:27,422
You're busy, daddy?

102
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,584
Fine.
I'll wait.

103
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:32,503
don't let me keep you two.

104
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:35,863
what are you doing here

105
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:37,246
In the middle of the night,
Stark?

106
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,226
I can have the police here
in two minutes.

107
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:42,838
well, I--it's--
it's just that--

108
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:45,406
Look, I know it was wrong
to sneak in,

109
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,823
But you wouldn't let me
come anymore.

110
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:49,132
I couldn't help it.

111
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:50,731
This place,

112
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:52,466
I grew up here.

113
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,319
It's all I have left
of my dad,

114
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:55,796
And--and...

115
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:00,492
am I supposed to believe
you're crying?

116
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:01,925
you monster!

117
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:03,470
How can you be so cruel?

118
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,802
You kicked him out of the place
he grew up,

119
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:07,363
And now you're gonna arrest him
for missing his father?

120
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:09,623
this has nothing to do
with you, whitney.

121
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:11,230
ne.
I'm leaving.

122
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:13,326
And Tony's coming with me.

123
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:15,552
Or are you gonna
arrest us both?

124
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:17,344
mr. O'Brien,

125
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,080
Get them both
out of here.

126
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:28,038
I want every single floor
of this building searched.

127
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,036
Stark was here
for a reason,

128
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,859
And I want to know
what it is.

129
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:40,568
thank you, whitney.

130
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:41,489
my pleasure.

131
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,293
Now tell me why
you were really there.

132
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,801
wow, it's late.

133
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,330
I really have to go.

134
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:47,904
Rhodey's mom
is gonna be so mad.

135
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:50,470
Seriously, whitney,
thanks.

136
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,305
you'd better call me.

137
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:59,931
wow, when you screw up,
you do it big.

138
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,127
you can quit
cheering him up now, Pepper.

139
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,279
did you even lock the vault
behind you?

140
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:05,732
oh, no.

141
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:08,502
sorry, but can't you just
hop in another suit

142
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,043
And go get the one
you left behind?

143
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,371
whiplash trashed the only
other one that worked.

144
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:13,708
The rest aren't ready,

145
00:07:13,972 --> 00:07:15,442
And we don't have time
to get them ready.

146
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:18,088
okay, what if we hope
really, really hard

147
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:20,374
That no one
ever goes down there?

148
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,801
that vault is the only thing
on that level,

149
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:25,512
And if it's been cleared out,

150
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,727
There's really no reason
someone would go down there.

151
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,798
Maybe Stane
won't suspect anything.

152
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,941
there's no way, dude.

153
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:33,989
There's no way Stane bought
that sob story you gave him.

154
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:35,735
He knows you were
up to something.

155
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:37,573
He's probably searching
the building right now.

156
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,119
And even if he's not,

157
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:40,900
It's not like he's going to
hand us visitor's passes

158
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:43,329
To get back in
any time soon.

159
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:44,711
that's it.

160
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:45,912
Iron man is finished.

161
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:47,290
wait.
Rhodey's right.

162
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:49,549
Stane won't hand out
visitor's passes to us,

163
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:51,779
But Stark international
might give out the passes

164
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:53,850
To the tomorrow academy.

165
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:57,003
uh, and that helps us how?

166
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:59,823
two words:
Field trip.

167
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:03,804
here's how it's gonna work.

168
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,200
The goal is to get
to the armor, get it working,

169
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,621
And get out
of Stark international

170
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:09,182
Without anyone seeing us.

171
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,568
Step one:

172
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,608
Get whatever tools, gizmos,
or batteries we need

173
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,261
To ma the armor work again.

174
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:17,766
what are you doing?

175
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:18,939
what?

176
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,381
This is the most important meal
of the day.

177
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:22,225
then Tony calls
whoever he still knows

178
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,708
At Stark international,

179
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:26,167
Someone who
owes him a favor.

180
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,425
tricia?
It's me, Tony, Tony Stark.

181
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:29,598
Tony?

182
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,450
I heard you came in here
last night.

183
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:33,018
Are you okay?

184
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,725
someone that can authorize
a tour of Stark international

185
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,714
For the tomorrow academy.

186
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:38,834
please?

187
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,492
Dad used to do this thing
all the time,

188
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,306
Tours, charities,
demonstrations.

189
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,084
Can you help?

190
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:46,308
My dad always said
I could count on you.

191
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:49,627
I--I'll see
what I can do, Tony.

192
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:52,460
I'll take care of getting
the trip

193
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:53,624
Authorized by the school.

194
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:56,376
Principal nara is all about
students showing initiative.

195
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:00,938
Pepper,
I like your initiative.

196
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:04,027
but what he really loves
is paperwork.

197
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,173
I'm afraid you'd have to get
permission slips

198
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,501
For eh and every student,
signed by their--oh.

199
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:10,931
as hall monitor,

200
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:12,558
I've busted about every kid
in the academy

201
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:13,912
For hallway violations.

202
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:16,297
I got their parents' signatures
from the reports.

203
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,126
a school tour?

204
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:24,781
Is this a joke?

205
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:26,595
no, mr. Stane.

206
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,483
We do it to keep up
the company's image

207
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:30,299
And to maintain ties
with the community.

208
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:32,290
the company's image
is no concern of--

209
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,314
oh, and your daughter's
on line four.

210
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:39,119
Rhodey can handle
transportation

211
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,339
And professor klein.

212
00:09:40,564 --> 00:09:41,859
He shouldn't take
much convincing.

213
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,830
I'm just having
such a hard time

214
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:45,465
With the concept of fusion.

215
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:46,577
really?

216
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:48,603
You got an "a" on the test.

217
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:50,477
that was just luck.

218
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,464
Uh, I totally guessed.

219
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:55,450
But it just so happens
that Stark international

220
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:58,262
Is having a demonstration
of their fusion reactors today.

221
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,904
So can we have class there?

222
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:04,669
I'd love to see
their labs.

223
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,998
Uh, can we do that?

224
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:09,106
there's a bus
waiting outside, sir.

225
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,540
I can't believe that worked.

226
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,039
how couldn't it work?

227
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:20,559
Now, once we get inside,

228
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,532
We'll cause a distraction
and split off from the tour,

229
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:24,361
Then get to the armor.

230
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:24,901
Piece of cake.

231
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,256
Pepper, if you ever go evil,

232
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:28,141
We're all in trouble.

233
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:29,336
[snorts]
tell me about it.

234
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:31,902
[excited chatter]

235
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:48,706
Stark.

236
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:51,849
hey, uh, gene.
What's up?

237
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,210
good question.

238
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:54,851
What exactly are you up to?

239
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,734
And don't lie,
because you're really bad at it.

240
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,767
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about, none.

241
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,101
see what I mean?

242
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,625
You're a terrible liar.

243
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,258
You, potts, and rhodes
had to go to a lot of trouble

244
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:06,703
To make this
little excursion happen.

245
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,195
we love science, man.

246
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:11,609
Nothing weird about that.

247
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:14,067
Now let's go in, please.

248
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,403
come with me.

249
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:19,971
gene, don't forget to give
Rhodey his lunch.

250
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:23,004
He gets really hungry.

251
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:27,692
that fell apart fast.

252
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,952
What now?

253
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:30,214
I don't know.

254
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:31,518
Plan "a" was so awesome,

255
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:33,150
I didn't come up
with a plan "b."

256
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,370
I'm guessing
that there's something

257
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:38,784
Much more interesting in here
than Rhodey's lunch.

258
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:41,967
You should have
asked me to help.

259
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,366
Both: [sigh]

260
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:45,444
okay.

261
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:47,094
One of us will have
to get to the armor

262
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,416
Replace the power cells,
and fly it out.

263
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:51,150
ooh-ooh-ooh.
I call it.

264
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,014
and stay out.

265
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:55,420
[laughs]

266
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:56,695
You got kicked out.

267
00:11:57,692 --> 00:11:58,652
thanks, happy.

268
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,097
Why aren't you inside?

269
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:02,940
dude, I was kicked out
before I even got off the bus.

270
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:06,668
go to school, whitney.

271
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:09,126
see, I value time
with my father more than school.

272
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:11,356
Too bad you don't feel
the same way about your work.

273
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:12,878
[phone rings]

274
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:15,073
what is it, O'Brien?

275
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,365
sir, Tony Stark just tried
to enter the building.

276
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:18,396
We ejected him,

277
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:20,053
But he's on
a school bus outside.

278
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,647
he's planning something.

279
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:23,631
Have you completed
the sweep of the building?

280
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:26,081
sir, there are 110 floors
in the building

281
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,365
With thousands of rooms.

282
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,563
We've completed 87%.

283
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,002
enough.

284
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:31,250
Finish the sweep,

285
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:33,593
And put Stark
under surveillance immediately.

286
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:39,949
and this
is our fusion reactor lab,

287
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:41,967
Where our scientists
work on ways to create

288
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:44,531
New, clean, and inexpensive
power sources

289
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:45,838
For the good of the world.

290
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:47,521
or weapons.
[hisses]

291
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:48,716
Will you focus?

292
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,693
Look, I have to be the one
to get the armor.

293
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,282
I know it inside and out.

294
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:54,178
And I know how
to change the power cells,

295
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:55,444
You don't.

296
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:57,082
okay, fine.
Crybaby.

297
00:12:57,923 --> 00:12:59,073
I'll do the diversion.

298
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:02,025
[sneaky music]

299
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:04,530
[glass shatters]

300
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:06,746
[alarms blare]

301
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,421
uh, fire?

302
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:15,020
that isn't a fire alarm.

303
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,138
It's a hazardous
material station.

304
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:19,091
oh, good to know.

305
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,430
no, I'm not trying
to rob the place.

306
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:26,804
I left something in there,

307
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,383
And I really want
to get it back.

308
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:29,852
Just help me find a way
to get in.

309
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,213
um, is it worth you doing
my science homework

310
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:33,450
For the next month?

311
00:13:33,703 --> 00:13:34,635
uh, sure.

312
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,976
What are you--

313
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:36,893
Smack!

314
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,831
aw, dude, sorry.

315
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,311
Loose ball.

316
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:43,732
You okay?

317
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:46,659
and stay there.

318
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,754
what happened to her?

319
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:53,268
hazmat station.

320
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,309
Just keep her here until
O'Brien comes down.

321
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:56,856
oh, come on.

322
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:59,289
I thought I saw
some toxic waste, for real.

323
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:01,283
You might want to go back
and check.

324
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,394
get me a visual
on Tony Stark.

325
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:05,731
He should be on the bus
outside.

326
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,324
Is that him?

327
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:16,422
I want this building
in lockdown, right now.

328
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:20,894
boo.
[screams]

329
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:24,769
Uh, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
beat you up when we get home.

330
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:27,031
fair enough.

331
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:33,517
Opening the door now.

332
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:35,332
[electronic beeping]

333
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:38,570
I seriously can't believe
we did it--

334
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:40,337
[shrill alarms wail]

335
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:41,828
you did it, all right.

336
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:48,581
[shrill alarms wail]

337
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:53,905
[nervous chatter]

338
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:58,246
and that concludes
today's tour.

339
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:02,207
what did you do?

340
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,035
nothing.
The door was already unlocked.

341
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,688
I was just opening it.

342
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:10,325
Uh-oh.

343
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,566
uh, what's going on?

344
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:24,612
Is it a meltdown?

345
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:26,014
Is the building going nuclear?

346
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,080
Oh, tell me the truth!

347
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:28,818
Oh, it's a meltdown!

348
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,767
what?
No, it's not a meltdown.

349
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:34,232
get me out of here!

350
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,789
[electronic chime]

351
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:43,276
[groans] take that.

352
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,182
and just how are we
supposed to get out, genius?

353
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,063
[buzzing drone]

354
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,346
no problem.
See?

355
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,011
They're cutting a way out
for us.

356
00:15:53,315 --> 00:15:55,045
there's no way
we're not going to be seen.

357
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,206
And the stealth tech
will just fry the armor again.

358
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:59,256
Stane will know that
we're involved with iron man.

359
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,763
I'll probably get arrested,

360
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:03,340
If these security drones
don't fry me first.

361
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:08,019
[laughs nervously]

362
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:11,450
status?

363
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:13,314
security drones have
activated on all levels

364
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:14,735
Per lockdown protocol.

365
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,370
If Tony Stark
is in the building,

366
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,039
They'll find him.

367
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,667
Hmm, that's weird.

368
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,588
See, on sublevel "Z,"

369
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,603
The drones are trying
to get into a room

370
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,235
That was cleared out weeks ago.

371
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:28,981
Stark's vault.

372
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,405
Get me a visual
on the vault, now!

373
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:34,934
O'Brien!

374
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,857
someone cut power
to the building.

375
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:39,327
But you can only do that
from right...

376
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,774
I am through being ignored!

377
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:49,137
great.

378
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:52,818
Clang!

379
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:54,936
I surrender.

380
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,179
[explosions]

381
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,207
what did I miss?

382
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:01,877
[laser blasts]

383
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:10,105
we have to get out
before the power comes back on.

384
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:12,401
[loud explosion]

385
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,766
Wait.
What are you--

386
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,621
[rapid laser fire]

387
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,659
I can walk.

388
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,047
Let me down!

389
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,256
we're taking a shortcut.

390
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:25,431
Zap!

391
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,679
well?

392
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:39,405
it, uh,
it takes a minute

393
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:41,492
For the grid to reboot, sir.

394
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:45,636
[engines whirring]

395
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:47,507
let me down.

396
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:49,446
trust me,
you don't want that.

397
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:51,458
[short booster blast]

398
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:52,866
[laser fire]

399
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:56,833
[explosion]

400
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:04,520
[adventurous music]

401
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:15,540
[explosion]

402
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:21,020
stop!
Let me off here.

403
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:23,228
I'll rejoin the group.

404
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,482
It'll be less suspicious.

405
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:30,222
but it'll be dark in there.

406
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:32,203
You sure you don't want me
to stay to hold hands?

407
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:33,665
just go.

408
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,678
Crash!

409
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,298
we're up and running again.

410
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,403
But the security camera
hard drives, they--

411
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:55,210
Uh-oh.

412
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,343
find Stark.

413
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:02,111
Find him now.

414
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:11,980
piece of cake.

415
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:13,830
I don't even want
to hear about it.

416
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,396
what is your problem?

417
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:16,401
[laughs]

418
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:17,987
I got foam in my nose--
in my nose!

419
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:20,428
Did you get to wear
the armor?

420
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,819
Ha, no.
Don't tell me.

421
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:25,209
one side, move!

422
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,019
yo, cue ball.

423
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:36,838
Can't you see we're busy?

424
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:39,444
Stark's been helping me
with my homework all morning.

425
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:42,026
you were inside
the building.

426
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:43,762
There are hundreds
of security cameras.

427
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,838
I'll find a--
uh, sir?

428
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,851
The hard drives crashed
when the power went out.

429
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:51,070
All of today's
surveillance video, it's gone.

430
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:01,060
I'm thinking
two months of homework.

431
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:04,036
yeah, sounds fair.

432
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,907
well, that went perfectly.

433
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:16,767
Except for every single detail.

434
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:18,840
Well, it was a good plan,
though.

435
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:21,415
yeah, I'm sure
you meant for gene, happy,

436
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,138
And Stane's own daughter
to help us.

437
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:24,876
Man, it's just pure luck

438
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,296
That Stane doesn't have
the armor right--

439
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,040
Tony, where is the armor?

440
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:31,164
oh, that?
Yeah, uh...

441
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:34,150
I may need some help
getting it back.

442
00:20:37,976 --> 00:20:41,266
