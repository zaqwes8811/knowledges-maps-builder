00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:02,858
<b> 2x14 - Mandarin's Quest</b>

2
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,594
Yo, Tony!
Hey, big shot!

3
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:14,457
Why so down?
You beat Stane.

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:17,058
In a few months
Stark International will be yours.

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,159
Which means free donuts from
the company commissary for like ever!

6
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:22,152
Donuts ...

7
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,432
I know you, you're still upset
about Stane being in a coma.

8
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:29,233
You're not? I wouldn't
want that to happen to anyone.

9
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:30,434
Not even Stane.

10
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:36,111
And...
other things could be better.

11
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:38,131
Well... no big lost there.

12
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:42,433
Come on, Tony, Iron Monger is history.
That's a positive!

13
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:51,484
Think about Stark International.

14
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,085
All the good you can do with it.

15
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:57,703
Maybe... you're right.
Maybe things are getting better.

16
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,985
Okay, class.
Pop quiz.

17
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:04,792
No complains,
when you'll finish, you can go.

18
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,603
Physics?
Why is it have to be physics?

19
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,384
Definitely back to his old self.

20
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:28,088
And that's helping me how?

21
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:29,652
Tony, wait up.

22
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:32,555
Honestly? I think I did
pretty good this time out.

23
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:34,456
At least B plus?

24
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:35,741
<i> Tony. </i>

25
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,743
Hello?
Who's there?

26
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:40,844
I'm ...
right here, Tony.

27
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,399
Greetings, my old friend.

28
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:54,333
- Gene!
- Mandarin!

29
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,834
Pepper Potts.
Tony Stark.

30
00:01:56,835 --> 00:02:00,835
Or should I just call you ...
Iron Man.

39
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,621
You can both relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you. 

40
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:58,115
Gene, I can't believe it.

41
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:01,616
This better be an apology, like the biggest
most massive apology in a history of ...

44
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,316
I'm not here to fight.
I promise you that.

45
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:12,721
In fact, I need your help.

46
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:15,422
Our help?
After everything you did?

47
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:19,023
Lied to me about my father, been alive!
Betraying all of us!

48
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,024
Betrayal is two sided, Stark.

49
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:22,925
You lied to me about beeing Iron Man.

50
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:25,326
What are you doing here, Gene?

51
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:28,428
I've located another Makluan ring.
But I've been unable to ...

52
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:32,229
Wait! Another ring?
There's only five rings, you have them all!

53
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,530
You're wrong.
After we defeated Fing Fang Fum,

54
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,931
I've discovered
there are ten rings in all.

55
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:38,932
- Ten?
- Ten?

56
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:41,695
I have seven
and I've located the eighth.

57
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,698
But I can't solve it's riddle.

58
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,097
That's why, I need your help.

59
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,017
With those ten rings
I can bring order to this chaotic world.

60
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,418
You can forget it.
I'll never help you!

61
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,844
You're the worst kind of evil.
Thinkin' you can hurt people for your just cause!

62
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:03,639
I'll give you something...
but I promise you, it won't be help!

63
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:08,935
I hoped that wouldn't come.

64
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:15,118
That's one way to stop your lying.
But I've got a couple of new tricks to ...

65
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,459
You're not the only one
who has upgraded.

66
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,060
Each ring I acquire enhances the others.
And greater their power.

67
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:33,511
The greater my power!

68
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:41,210
Oh-oh.

69
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:47,677
Have enough?

70
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:51,848
I had more than enough.

71
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:55,049
A C plus?
I deserved at least the B.

72
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,511
- Gene is back.
- Gene?

73
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,912
Gene is in... Gene Khan?

74
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:02,487
Do you know another Gene?

75
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:05,286
<i>When? Why?
Where are you?</i>

76
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:11,489
In an alley, downtown.
He and Tony... having a nice little chat.

77
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,790
Sounds like repulsors.
Least Tony is getting too sensitive.

78
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:18,324
Well, Gene is doing most
of the talking.

79
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,125
Tell Tony to hang in
untill I get there.

80
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:23,248
You care for look at my new rings?

81
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:25,836
How about... number six?

82
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,273
<i>Warning!
Armor integrity compromised. </i>

83
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:34,774
The sixth ring is acid chaos,
capable of goin' into any material.

84
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:36,775
Even your wanted armor.

85
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,176
<i>Whole breach imminent.</i>

86
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,978
Gotta get this stuff off me!
Full power to shields!

87
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,250
Sorry Mandarin,
no rain cloud is gonna stop me.

88
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:53,953
That's the spirit I learn.

89
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:03,934
That's new.

90
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:09,338
<i>Pepper, what's all that wreckage? </i>

91
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:12,140
- You gonna wanna...
- Hurry. I know, I know.

92
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,330
That... all you got?

93
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:19,031
Such persistence.

94
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:22,932
That's why I need you
to help me recover the eighth ring.

95
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,733
And I can help you.

96
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,260
Observe... the seventh ring.

97
00:06:28,994 --> 00:06:30,994
Tony!
What are you doing?

98
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,199
Improves mental power.
All your knowledge can be accessed.

99
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,701
Would you like to know exactly
what happened to your father?

100
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:43,102
He's gone.
You did it.

101
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:46,320
- Didn't you?
- No, Stark.

102
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:51,121
Attaining the eighth ring make the seventh
powerful enought to uncover the truth.

103
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:54,709
Help me to Tony,
so I can help you.

104
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:56,424
- I'll help you.
- Tony!

105
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:58,025
I know what I'm doing.

106
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,485
No, you don't, man!
Are you insane?

107
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,286
I need precision fire.
Now!

108
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,056
<i>Target locked.</i>

109
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,957
It will be just like old times.

110
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:11,483
- Tony!
- Pepper!

111
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:16,774
Oh, man!
Not... good ...

112
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,671
Follow me.
You'll be safe right here, Pepper. 

113
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,825
- Don't you think, Tony?
- He's right, the temple guardians.

114
00:07:50,826 --> 00:07:54,627
I have no problem hangin' out here.
Heh... all by myself.

115
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:57,028
With the snakes, and...
desert spiders ...

116
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:59,797
and rabid camels.

117
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:04,218
Ok.
Let's go satellite mode.

118
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,901
Daddy's totally gonna kill me,
when he gets my cellphone bill.

119
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:11,497
Tony! Do you read me?
Pepper, are you there?

120
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:15,553
<i>Rhodey, I read you.
Sort of ... </i>

121
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:18,324
Where are you? I'm not
pickin' up a tracker in Tony's armor.

122
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:22,549
<i>I'm outside the temple,
in the desert somewhere. And it's night time.</i>

123
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,950
Night?
You must be half around the world.

124
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:29,164
But this whole thing makes no sense.
Tony gets beat down by Gene.

125
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:33,052
And suddenly they're acting like the best friends
and go to the magic bubbleride with him?

126
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:36,153
<i> I know, something is not right.
He seems normal, but ... </i>

127
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:38,354
I think there's something up.
Big time!

128
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,355
I've got your location. Egypt.

129
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,445
Oh, that is so cool!
I always wanted to go...

130
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:47,017
<i>Man!
And now I'm here...</i>

131
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:51,218
<i>No pyramids, no Sphinx,
no Cairo, just the whole lot of... sand. </i>

132
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:57,775
Computer, calculate an orbital
reentry trajectory with the fastest travel time.

133
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:01,176
<i>Wait! Didn't War Machine lose power
last time you left the atmosphere?</i>

134
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:02,977
You think
Tony didn't upgrade this suit?

135
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:04,978
Come on, now.
Of course, he did.

136
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:06,689
Better have ...

137
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,291
Look out!

138
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,270
I thank you. But...
I'm not even sure what I'm doing here.

139
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:31,262
Where is Pepper?
Rhodey?

140
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:38,331
Already translated the puzzle.

141
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:42,805
" Who would master the future
must endure the pain of the past. "

142
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:46,106
The ring is inside the Grim Reaper's statue.

143
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,507
Get it for me.

144
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:50,271
Wait.
Something is wrong.

145
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,361
Tony!
Get me the ring!

146
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,641
It ... burns ...

147
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:14,614
Don't give up!
Use your will!

148
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:23,636
I knew you'll come through.
Show it to me.

149
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:34,537
<i>Help me, Tony.
So I could help you. </i>

150
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:41,077
I command you, give me the ring!

151
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:45,883
Your seventh ring.
It has mental powers, allright?

152
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:48,284
To influence the minds of others!

153
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:51,902
But not me!
Not anymore.

154
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:01,157
So be it!

155
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,132
Pepper to Rhodey!.
What's your status?

156
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:12,474
<i>Did Tony upgrade your armor?
Or are you floating around the orbit. </i>

157
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,650
About that...

158
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:18,989
I gotta go.
You're same?

159
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,490
Tony is back. Mandarin must
have been messing with his head.

160
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,091
Hurry, we need your help!

161
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,588
I'll be there as fast as I can.

162
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:44,875
<i>You must endure!</i>

163
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:48,004
Oh-oh.
Guess the test is not over.

164
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:57,595
<i>You must endure!</i>

165
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:09,157
<i>You must endure!</i>

166
00:12:12,244 --> 00:12:13,244
Impossible!

167
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,410
Gene!

168
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:21,243
<i>You must endure!</i>

169
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,624
Let's see you endure a live!

170
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,145
Pepper, get out of here!

171
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:31,774
And that's that.
So such a sure.

172
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,583
Tony!

173
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,317
Tony, can you hear me?

174
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,160
<i>Can you hear me? </i>

175
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,003
<i>Tony, wake up! </i>

176
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,297
Dad? You're alive!

177
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:16,799
Last time I checked.
That must have been some dream!

178
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,500
My heart monitor.
Everything is normal again!

179
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:24,393
Oh, it wasn't a dream.
More like a nightmare.

180
00:13:24,394 --> 00:13:25,494
Well, it's over now.

181
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:27,695
No!
We are on a plane!

182
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:28,696
<i>The plane!</i>

183
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,579
<i>Dad, our lives are in danger!
No!</i>

184
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:45,036
<i>Tony!</i>

185
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:48,224
<i>Tony!
Can you hear me? </i>

186
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:49,847
Tony!

187
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,446
Rhodey!
It is a Tony and Gene, the guardian ...

188
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:54,847
<i>... oh, got them!</i>

189
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,350
I'm closing at your coordinates.
We've got a problem.

190
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,109
A big problem.

191
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:02,993
<i>The temple is about to be swallowed
by a mega-giant dust storm.</i>

192
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:04,694
<i>We all must be buried alive!</i>

193
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:21,377
The prodigal son returns.

194
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:24,478
To take revenge for
what you did to my mother!

195
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:30,876
And how will pityful motherless Gene
ever hope to achieve that?

196
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,480
Looking for these?

197
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:43,130
Now, you will beg for your life!

198
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:45,031
I will never bow to you!

199
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:50,685
And that is only the beginning.

200
00:14:57,587 --> 00:14:59,887
Computer.
Stabilize the turbulence.

201
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:01,288
Full power to the thrusters.

202
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:05,028
Gotta be a way through that storm.

203
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:09,968
Further are...

204
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:13,769
Iron Man success has been
generated solely by my new invention.

205
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,771
Wait, invention?
Last I saw, you were in a coma.

206
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,494
Only in your dreams, Tony.

207
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:22,995
Now, back to business.

208
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:27,696
Profits are up 2000 percent, since the
Stane armor debut to the public.

209
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,297
The "Stane armor"?

210
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:32,198
I know the transition
has been difficult for you,

211
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,099
but you must admit, my new
armor is our most popular product.

212
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:45,596
<i>As you can see, the military's
once again become our biggest customer.</i>

213
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:48,997
<i>No, no, it's not possible!</i>

214
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:53,571
<i>We did even outfit the police
with our new law enforcement armor.</i>

215
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:57,752
<i> Of course, some suits
may fall into wrong hands,</i>

216
00:15:57,753 --> 00:15:59,753
<i>just like any powerful weapon. </i>

217
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:03,584
<i>Peacekeeping applications for the armor
are only the beginning. </i>

218
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:12,427
Stane armor can by used anywhere ...
by anyone.

219
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:20,299
This ...
this is my worst fear comes to life!

220
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,500
How did this happen?

221
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,201
Stane International has became the most

222
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,901
powerful weapon's
manufacturer in the world.

223
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,302
Stane Inter...?
It's Stark International!

224
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:32,103
You are the least powerful
member of this board.

225
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:34,504
The time has come for you
to just give up.

226
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:36,843
I'll never give up to you!

227
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:38,841
Then I have no choice.

228
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:41,842
Tony Stark, you're fired!

229
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,154
You can't fire me!
This is my company, Stane,

230
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,255
I'm takin' back my armor, right now!

231
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:53,026
Oh, well, well.
I do believe, we have a mutiny.

232
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:08,302
I've been looking for it, putting you
out of your misery, for a long time.

233
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:19,305
<i>Warning!
Armor compromised.   </i>

234
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,525
<i>All systems at 20 percent and falling.</i>

235
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,440
Surrender, Stark!

236
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,951
<i>Keep fighting!
Don't give up, Tony!</i>

237
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:36,861
<i>System failure.</i>

238
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:41,310
Stane, you will never...
make me give up!

239
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:47,103
Destroy him!
Fire everything!

240
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:52,558
I beat you, Stane.
My armor can't hurt me.

241
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,659
Because I created it.
I control it!

242
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:58,731
This is just a dream.
And I have enough!

243
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:03,762
<i>You have endure!</i>

244
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:10,849
<i>Do something!
Before we're buried in here.</i>

245
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,500
No doubt!
The temple's been torn to pieces.

246
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:17,892
If I can't beat this thing,
I'm just gonna have to join it!

247
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:18,993
<i>What are you talking about? </i>

248
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:19,994
Physics.

249
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:21,795
<i>But you're terrible in physics!</i>

250
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:28,243
Yes!
Totally deserve the A on that quiz!

251
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,935
Tony, you're back!
You made it.

252
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,920
Thanks to you.

253
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:40,438
Look out!

254
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,340
No more bad dreams.
The Reaper's playing for keeps now.

255
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:44,723
What are you doing?

256
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,624
Trying to wake him up.
Like it's odd, we need him!

257
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,625
Gene!

258
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:50,126
Have you gone crazy?

259
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,633
There is good in him.
I know it.

260
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,234
Besides, we don't have a choice!

261
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:05,903
Time to wake up!

262
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:23,117
<i>Your fears are only
as real as you make them. </i>

263
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:35,841
Gene, we have to work together.

264
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,542
This thing is too tough for
either of us to defeat alone!

265
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:40,698
No!

266
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:47,534
A temporary trusted.
but the eighth ring will be mine.

267
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:49,635
Yeah, we'll se.
But first things first.

268
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:02,443
They said, you guys make a great team.

269
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:09,559
- Don't get used to it.
- Walk away, Stark.

270
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,960
Stay yourself a humiliation
of another defeat.

271
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,508
My odds are improving.
Glad you get make it.

272
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,509
Hope you left something
for me to bust on.

273
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,610
I've got the ring, you take Mandarin.

274
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:26,205
Missed me?

275
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:33,326
I never miss, Rhodes!

276
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:45,737
Nice work, Rhodey!

277
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:49,238
Little mettle had to come in.
And there's a whole lot more.

278
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:58,333
Gene, this isn't you.

279
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:01,334
And I will not give up
on the real you.

280
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:04,636
I ... I'm doing this
for greater good. Believe me.

281
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:08,691
Now you will learn the true power
of the Makluan rings.

282
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,609
I have superspeed
and the vortex at my command.

283
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,350
Could have left us to that tornado,
burried in sand.

284
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,851
He's still a criminal!
And next time, I'm taking him down!

285
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:55,452
We're taking hom down!

286
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:57,553
But what if what Gene said is true?

287
00:21:57,554 --> 00:22:01,255
Yeah. That he could use the ring to find
what happened to your dad.

288
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:04,556
Only thing I know for sure is
that Gene Khan is a liar.

289
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,557
Who'll do or say anything
to get what he wants!

290
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,455
Home sweet home.

291
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:19,813
Good evening, Howard.

292
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:21,991
You recovered the eighth ring?

293
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:25,192
Your son and I succeeded,
where you and I failed.

294
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:27,293
I'd expect no less from Tony,

295
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:30,694
but I swear, if you ever trying
use him again, I'll... !

296
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:33,995
You'll do nothing, Stark!
But rod in a cage!

297
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:38,590
Until all ten rings are mine.
